  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>Sunny Side Gulch is normally bone dry when canyoneers would normally\nrun Middle Earth in moderate flow. However, on a wet year (such as\n2023), SSG flows quite well and can be a fun class B run. As of the\nFirst Descent, it was flowing nicely and we were glad to have rain\njackets. We did a sneak version climbing up Sunny Side Bench rock climb,\nthen continuing up that side and traversing over to get to the drop-in\npoint, which required a few exposed ledge traverses, and 2 short rappels\nto get into the drainage proper. It certainly can be done from the top\noff the rim trail for double the vertical extent.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n",
