However, on a wet year (such as 2023), SSG flows quite well and can be a fun class B run.  As of the First Descent, it was flowing nicely and we were glad to have rain jackets.  We did a sneak version climbing up Sunny Side Bench rock climb, then continuing up that side and traversing over to get to the drop-in point, which required a few exposed ledge traverses, and 2 short rappels to get into the drainage proper.  It certainly can be done from the top off the rim trail for double the vertical extent.\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Red_tape\">Red tape<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Beta_sites\">Beta sites<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Background\">Background<\/h2><\/div>\n\n\n<\/div>","shuttleSeconds":null,"rappelCountMax":5,"longitude":-119.5906,"rappelCountMin":5,"rappelLongestMeters":100.58,"name":"Sunny Side Gulch","latitude":37.7551,"waterRating":"B","version":"71ad2886120c916b527c7b50a597f44471f11393b146a98f6f6aaf596a4c57be","url":"https:\/\/ropewiki.com\/Sunny_Side_Gulch","months":["Mar","Apr","May"]}
