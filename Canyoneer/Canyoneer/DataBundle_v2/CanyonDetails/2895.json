  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>While the short lower portion of Boulder Creek may have at one point\nbeen used for short guided trips (and I guess could be done as a short\ntrip if you really, really wanted to?) Boulder Creek itself presents a\nvery demanding, and quite extended canyoneering trip that descends 3,000\nfeet of elevation over 6 miles. While most of this descent is\nnon-technical, it is highly scenic, includes a few good jumps, some\nextremely high quality slides, and a middle technical section with big,\nimpressive, and exciting drops.</p>\n<p>Note that the canyon can be descended with 200 foot ropes, but a 300\nfoot rope will make things easier, and more fun.</p>\n<p>Also most of the technical canyon is not friendly Sierra Granite, it\nis instead, an often sharp and angular Schist. Creep your ropes!</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>The Kanawyer trail (leaves from Kennedy Meadows TH) offers a way to\ndrop you into Boulder Creek shortly above the more technical section of\nBoulder Creeek, skipping some fun sections of canyon higher up. This\nwould be the best option for parties trying to complete Boulder Creek in\na single day, but unfortunately, the Kanawyer trail is still closed from\nthe Rough Fire, despite the rest of the area being open.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To get to the upper drop-in, drive out FS road 14S02 from the Quail\nFlat turn off of General's Highway to the end of the pavement and park.\nHike down the dirt road a few minutes to where it curves right on top of\na ridge, then hike down this ridge a short distance to Boulder Creek.\nYou should find a good spot to suit up and jump in. Note that the amount\nof water flowing down this should look rather low. ~3cfs is plenty for\nexcitement. Anything much over 5cfs would probably require you to find a\nway to bypass the best drop.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p><strong>Upper Section:</strong></p>\n<p>Almost immediately down canyon a technical section begins where large\nboulders have fallen into the granite gorge. Many options are available\nhere as you climb, rappel, and perhaps occasionally jump your way down\ncanyon.</p>\n<p>A large sliding waterfall is probably too shallow at the very base to\nactually slide, although some good jumping options are available. The\nlow angle slide below here also looks quite risky, and you will likely\nagree is best to walk around.</p>\n<p>After a bit of creek hopping you will encounter a beautiful granite\ngorge. The first drop is a rappel. Note that under the current of the\ninitial drop, is a hanging pothole, with a lip that is apparently very\ndifficult to get out of. This is probably best bypassed by rappelling\ndown canyon left.</p>\n<p>Below here you walk through a chute, to a sliding drop, that as of\nour descent, made for an excellent slide. I forget the exact order of\nthings below here, but there is a big waterfall with jumping options,\nand another fun, long slide. Also definitely some non-slides in there as\nwell.</p>\n<p>Below this gorge the gradient slackens as you enter a scenic, yet\nsomewhat tedious gorge with slow hiking on uneven slippery surfaces and\nsome short, shallow jumps. There is one nice jump as you near the bottom\nof this section, which is best done from up on the right. This section\nends in an cool non-technical gorge of what I assume is marble.</p>\n<p>Below this exit into the trees on the left for the most pleasant\nwalking along the creek. There's good camping potential in these trees,\nparticularly as you first enter them (last camping before the wilderness\nboundary). Downstream the forest ends and you are pushed back into a\ngorge, this time with relatively easy walking.</p>\n<p>Not far below this at a sharp left hand bend, just before reaching\nthe Kanawyers trail, a camp is on the left at the inside of the bend.\nThis camp has been equipped with some camping equipment, such as a\nfrying pan, a grill, a coffee pot, and some other random items, which\ncould be useful for us canyoneers and our packs that are often\nill-suited for overnights.</p>\n<p><strong>Main Section:</strong></p>\n<p>The Kanawyers trail (very faint) crosses just downstream from this\ncamp, and not far down is an amazing waterslide, over a 100 feet long!\nThis slide isn't perfect, and has a little bumpy section in the center,\nnear the bottom that is a bit unpleasant if you go in, though several of\nus did this, and no one was actually hurt. This bumpy bit is avoided by\nstarting the slide to the right, which actually throws you to the right\nof the slide for the funnest, smoothest line. Should make sense once you\nsee it.</p>\n<p>Hiking downstream through the gorge the next thing you come upon is a\n~25 foot waterfall. Rappel from a tree on the right, or jump from the\nleft.</p>\n<p>A bit further, and you'll start to get excited. Next comes the best\ndrop. A 270 foot drop that slides through a slot, then falls out of a\ncliff into a big amphitheater below. If the water is high, you may have\nto find your one way around (try the right?). Rocks are sharp, creep\nyour rope! Bolts are set down canyon left. (Note: One of these bolts is\na spinner: 3/8ths sleeve style bolt, hole was not drilled quite deep\nenough. Oops! Lots of canyon karma to whoever fixes it). You can rappel\nthis as one large drop with a 300 foot rope, or, you can rappel 70 feet\ndown into a pocket on the right, set an anchor off of boulders there,\nand rappel the last 200 feet. Also, there is a ledge 40 feet off the\ndeck, down canyon left, which you can use to get off rappel if you do\nnot want to, or have enough rope to go all the way down.</p>\n<p>Next big drop can be dealt with by climbing up to the left, one short\nrappel down to a big ledge off a tree, and another big rappel down off\nof another one. Next drop cuts left into a slot, rappelled from trees on\nthe left, then carefully scout the landing for the short jump that\nfollows.</p>\n<p>A BIG horizon line comes next. Approaching it you see a big sliding\nwaterfall. If you go left, you can cut down to a tree hanging off the\nedge of a cliff, and rappel ~120 feet to bypass this waterfall. A more\nenjoyable option would likely be to rappel into the down canyon right\npocket above this waterfall, set an anchor off the big rock horn there,\nand then rappel the waterfall down to the bottom. We <em>think</em> that\na 300 foot rope would do it, but this is not confirmed.</p>\n<p>Last rappel can go from a tree way up to the left, surrounded by some\ninconvenient brush.</p>\n<p>With the technical section over, you still have a ways to go.\nProgress through here can be quick though, and there are occasional\nslides or short jumps to keep things fun, and the canyon is still\noverall quite pretty. Less than half a mile from the end you will reach\nan old bridge column. Here you can decide on your exit.</p>\n<p><strong>Lower Section</strong></p>\n<p>A trail cuts out to the left and heads for Boyden Caverns. This trail\nis currently closed, but please don't let that force you into risking\nyour life, as the alternative to the trail is crossing the South Fork of\nthe Kings River at a potentially dangerous spot. The trail can be\nreached from further down canyon, and I recommend continuing down, as\nyou will miss a really nice little section by cutting out here.</p>\n<p>This lower section is mostly a hike, and goes past what is almost an\nawesome slide, but seems like it has potential for shattering your tail\nbone, so it's probably good to give it a pass. Closer to the river, the\ncanyon enters a short, narrow gorge via a ~10 foot tall sliding\nwaterfall. The best way down, is to climb up to the left. This is a bit\nof a difficult move, but the first person up can climb a bit higher to\nset a safety line for the rest of the party. From this ledge, a ~20 foot\njump into the chamber below is easy. Another short jump downstream\nshould be carefully scouted.</p>\n<p>Below here is a rappel from a tree (surrounded by poison oak) into a\npool below a waterfall. Just above it, on the left, you can cut up a\nmere 120 feet of elevation to reach the trail to Boyden Cavern. If you\nrappel from this tree, and don't ascend back up, you are more or less\ncommitting to the river crossing.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>The trail mentioned, is in awful shape. You'll encounter way more\npoison oak than you ever wanted to see, cross parts that are exposed\n(one 20 foot area could be considered 4th class), cross sections calving\naway, traverse loose debris flow, and climb over and around many downed\ntrees. The burnt bridge (the reason for the trail being closed) is\napparently the least of your worries, as the steel I-beams and wood\nrailing (river side) are fully intact. BUT, this is absolutely still the\nsafer of your two options.</p>\n<p>Swiftwater river crossing skills (canyoneering in 15 cfs does not\nprepare you for rivers running at 500 cfs) are necessary to cross the\nriver. Lifejackets are a good idea, but likely you'll just have your\npack with all your stuff, and be swimming with that. We crossed the\nriver here at 336 cfs. At this level we had mixed results, with some of\nour party making it across easily, others getting across a little more\nnarrowly, and one member making use of a well tossed rope. I wouldn't\nrecommend crossing at any higher levels, and I'm not entirely sure I'd\nrecommend crossing at this level. At &lt;200 cfs I suspect it might be\nfairly simple for those experienced with swift water.</p>\n<p>More specifically, this involves floating through current down along\nthe cliff on river left (easy at this level), and pushing off the wall\nto make a quick ferry after the last bit of flow hits against the wall.\nThis last bit of flow (which is the largest channel of the river) will\npush you into the wall, so starting against the wall seems the best bet.\nAlternatively, I was able to climb out of the current onto a ledge on\nthe wall, climb ~12 feet up, and jump out into maybe 5 feet of water,\nclearing a good bit of the flow, and getting a head start on the swim. I\npreferred this method.</p>\n<p>Again, please, please, please make good choices here, and strongly\nconsider just taking the hike out on the terrible trail. It'll be over\nquickly, even if the poison oak you get won't.</p>\n<p>Note from willie92708 about the poison oak and using the trail: You\nwill be back to your shuttle vehicle quickly enough. Take 10 minutes and\na bottle of Technu, Campsuds, and or Dawn Dishwashing soap, stroll down\nto the Kings River and wash the poison oak oil off your gear, wetsuit,\npants, pack, shoes, socks and yourself. Do this before you get into your\nvehicle and get the oil all over it. This really does work to prevent\nbreaking out with a rash later. I did this after hiking this trail\n9/10/2017 and wading through all the poison oak, I'm highly allergic to\nit, and yet not the slightest bubble 4 days later. Trust me, quick\nsoaping and washing everything really does work!</p>\n<p>Note from willie92708 about the river crossing: You could split the\ngroup (part going all the way down the canyon, others taking the trail)\nand have the trail group drive back and assist with the river crossing.\nWith a proper weighted throw rope, a person on the road side could get a\nline across to ferry lifejackets (PFD's) even frog feet to the Boulder\nCreek side. The line could then be reversed to ferry packs and people to\nthe road side of the river. This allows extra safety gear to be used for\nthe river crossing without having to haul it through the canyon.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<p>Both the Kanawyers trail, and the trail from Boulder Creek to Boyden\nCavern are closed from the Rough Fire. However I cannot imagine anyone\nwill fault you for hiking out the trail to Boyden if you felt like the\nriver crossing would be too dangerous.</p>\n<p>Also technically if you spend the night in the wilderness area, you\nare supposed to have a wilderness permit from the forest service. But\nthere is a good camping area in the trees just before you get into the\nwilderness area, and if you camp there and continue the next day, then\nit's just day use!</p>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n<p>10 of us descended Boulder Creek in September of 2017. The only\nevidence of other descents were two manky fixed lines dangling off the\ntree for the last rappel. Apparently Boyden Caves may have done some\nguiding in this lower section at some point in history.</p>\n",
