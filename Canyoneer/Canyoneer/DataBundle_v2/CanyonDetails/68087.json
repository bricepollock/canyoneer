  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>A unique mini canyon off Bear Sign trail.</p>\n<p>Reccomended to hike up canyon from r1 to the Coconino potholes before\nstarting your journey down canyon. This was a highlight.</p>\n<p>A high clearance vehicle will be needed to get you to the trailhead.\nEstimated 40 min drive.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>Park at Bear Sign Th. Hike just over 2 miles to approach drainage.\nTake a right up the drainage navigating through brush and log jams.\nAfter tip toeing over the logs keep your eyes peeled for an approach\ngully on the left. It is fairly loose but a direct gully to the slab\nabove. Once on the slab gain the ridge and walk it up to the downclimb\ngully on your left. After reaching the canyon floor drop your pack and\nhead up canyon for 10 minutes stemming over potholes. This section\nshould not be missed. After reaching the top pothole downclimb\nwatercourse to your packs and head to R1.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p><strong>R1</strong>: 30' off tree.</p>\n<p><strong>R2</strong> 30' off tree.</p>\n<p><strong>R3</strong> 200' RUC on tree too floor, or 185' to ledge and\ndownclimb LDC.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>After last rappel connect with Bear Sign Trail and return the way you\ncame.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<p><a\nhref=\"https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=10101929122784652&amp;id=38100945\">https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=10101929122784652&amp;id=38100945</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n<p>Established by Eric Moorcroft &amp; Garrett Bennet 11/22/21</p>\n",
