Carefully follow the well defined path winding through the hoodoos. Careless footprints have negatively impacted the \"crypto-cactus gardens\". Continue above the hoodoos and onto the red slickrock; this gives you a vantage point for orienting yourself. Approaching the slot too early is complicated and risks damaging the landscape. Whereas starting to the south of the slot lets you use the long rope a couple times instead of just once.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>There are several suitable trees to anchor from for the entry rappel. The last rappel at the end of the canyon now has large, white, soft Wingate boulders to anchor from. These will eventually be washed away. Using one of these makes the rappel about 44 meters long. Before the boulders fell into the canyon you had to use smaller rocks to build an anchor in a location that makes the rappel closer to 50 meters long.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Red_tape\">Red tape<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Beta_sites\">Beta sites<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Background\">Background<\/h2><\/div>\n\n\n<\/div>","longitude":-111.2513,"version":"60378abfa46b638489ae20c131bcdaca86ba7f16e3ce7487f5573e96c39002ae","permit":"No","geojson":null,"waterRating":"A"}
