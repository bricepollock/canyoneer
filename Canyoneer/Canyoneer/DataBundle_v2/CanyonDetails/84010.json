  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>Just a brief slot and a dramatic way to descend from the King bench.\nIf not for the interesting surroundings it wouldn't be worth while.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>Use the long approach for Headless Duck. Carefully follow the well\ndefined path winding through the hoodoos. Careless footprints have\nnegatively impacted the \"crypto-cactus gardens\". Continue above the\nhoodoos and onto the red slickrock; this gives you a vantage point for\norienting yourself. Approaching the slot too early is complicated and\nrisks damaging the landscape. Whereas starting to the south of the slot\nlets you use the long rope a couple times instead of just once.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>There are several suitable trees to anchor from for the entry rappel.\nThe last rappel at the end of the canyon now has large, white, soft\nWingate boulders to anchor from. These will eventually be washed away.\nUsing one of these makes the rappel about 44 meters long. Before the\nboulders fell into the canyon you had to use smaller rocks to build an\nanchor in a location that makes the rappel closer to 50 meters long.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n",
