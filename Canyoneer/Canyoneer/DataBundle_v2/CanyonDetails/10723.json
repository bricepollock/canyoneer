Maybe other people will appreciate this place as much as I did and eventually clean it up.  Until then, it serves as a sad example of what can happen if we don't take care of nature around us.\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Drive up Forest Road 77 just east of Gallina, NM for about 2 miles.  As the dirt road climbs uphill, you will see a sandstone canyon on your right and come to cattle guard.  Park at the cattle guard.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>The slot canyon gets deeper until you reach a couple of chokestones that are just a bit too high of the ground to safely drop.  There is a log on canyon left that makes a good anchor for this 20' drop.  After this is some downclimbing until a pothole is reached.  A good climber can climb around on canyon right using the tree roots and some rocks, but most will want to go through the pothole which will require a 25' rap and potentially some pothole escape experience.  The trash continues to get more diverse and is directly in the canyon.  A final 20' drop is required.  It could be done as a fast slide with a 5' drop, but is probably best to do as a rappel.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Walk down canyon until you ind a social trail leading up to the right back to the road, then go back up the road to your car.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Red_tape\">Red tape<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Beta_sites\">Beta sites<\/h2><\/div>\n<ul><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http:\/\/dougscottart.com\/hobbies\/SlotCanyons\/Vertedero.htm\">Doug Scott's New Mexico Slot Canyons<\/a> &#160;: Vertedero Canyon<\/li><\/ul>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>First descent Kelton Manzanares 10\/30\/15\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Background\">Background<\/h2><\/div>\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nParsed by mw‐api‐ext.codfw.main‐6779cc57fc‐2jlvz\nCached time: 20240914191824\nCache expiry: 2592000\nReduced expiry: false\nComplications: [show‐toc]\nCPU time usage: 0.005 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.007 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 21\/1000000\nPost‐expand include size: 0\/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 0\/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 2\/100\nExpensive parser function count: 0\/500\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0\/20\nUnstrip post‐expand size: 0\/5000000 bytes\nNumber of Wikibase entities loaded: 0\/400\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%    0.000      1 -total\n-->\n<\/div>","riskRating":null,"rappelLongestMeters":7.62,"vehicle":"Passenger","months":["May","Jun","Sep","Oct","Nov"],"id":10723,"shuttleSeconds":null,"timeRating":"I","longitude":-106.7689,"version":"8aaba474817f99945dffb82bfa44429681b49ef243e0c9a93f233af6c6f928f6","latitude":36.2341,"geojson":null,"permit":"No"}
