If you were going to do Rock Creek, make a base camp at the Kern Hot Springs and take an easy day trip down to Rattlesnake Creek for a sweet little canyon.\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Right off the Rattlesnake Creek Trail as it drops into Kern Canyon, 4 easy miles south of the hot springs.  How you get there is totally up to you.  \n<\/p><p>From the bottom of the canyon hike up the switch backs getting some nice views of the drops on your way up.  Eventually the canyon is down on your left and bordered by talas.  Scramble down here and head into the bed rock.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Starts off with a neat little rappel into a grotto.  Somewhere soon after you hit one of the drops you saw on the way up.  Three stage rappel, first one is awkward down into a pool, second one is big and beautiful into a large chamber with beautiful water and a cave in the back.  Keep on rappel for a third stage unless you consider yourself a good climber, in which case you can climb down it on the left.  Another rappel takes you out of here, but stay in the gorge for the final section of canyon with another large rappel.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>You'll come out right next to Rattlesnake Creek trail.
