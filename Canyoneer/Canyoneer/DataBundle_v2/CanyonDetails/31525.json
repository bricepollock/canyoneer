While just barely long enough to make a worthwhile canyoneering route, it is beautiful and exciting.\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>You can get there from Erbie or the road down to Broadwater hollow.  Hike up (or down) Cecil Creek.  You can approach via Hideout Hollow, or up ridges leaving from Cecil Creek on either side of Thunder Canyon.  The terrain is pretty easy, at least in the cooler months before the undergrowth comes in.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>A short downclimb is encountered before the technical part of the canyon.  The first rappel is dry and simple, about 20 feet down off of a tree.  The next is longer off a tree down a waterfall into a waist deep pool above Thunder Canyon Falls.  The last rappel down the falls proper is I think 80 feet, but maybe a bit more.  A knot chock and a natural arch down canyon left above the falls makes a great natural anchor for this beautiful rappel.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>FYI, the bottom of the falls is extraordinarily slippery.  There is pretty hiking past or through some shallow slots downstream.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Red_tape\">Red tape<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Beta_sites\">Beta sites<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Background\">Background<\/h2><\/div>\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nParsed by mw‐api‐ext.codfw.main‐6779cc57fc‐9fx5c\nCached time: 20240914191948\nCache expiry: 2592000\nReduced expiry: false\nComplications: [show‐toc]\nCPU time usage: 0.006 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.007 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 21\/1000000\nPost‐expand include size: 0\/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 0\/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 2\/100\nExpensive parser function count: 0\/500\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0\/20\nUnstrip post‐expand size: 0\/5000000 bytes\nNumber of Wikibase entities loaded: 0\/400\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%    0.000      1 -total\n-->\n<\/div>","url":"https:\/\/ropewiki.com\/Thunder_Canyon","technicalRating":3,"rappelCountMax":3,"permit":"No","waterRating":"C","quality":4,"riskRating":null,"rappelCountMin":3,"longitude":-93.2535,"geojson":null,"name":"Thunder Canyon","version":"6adde60574a02c4317c34bb1a165095a7393de270362d996d9d4d5a6d03e5f6b","latitude":36.0861,"timeRating":"II","rappelLongestMeters":30.48,"id":31525,"vehicle":"Passenger"}
