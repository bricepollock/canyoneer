Hike up (or down) Cecil Creek.  You can approach via Hideout Hollow, or up ridges leaving from Cecil Creek on either side of Thunder Canyon.  The terrain is pretty easy, at least in the cooler months before the undergrowth comes in.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>A short downclimb is encountered before the technical part of the canyon.  The first rappel is dry and simple, about 20 feet down off of a tree.  The next is longer off a tree down a waterfall into a waist deep pool above Thunder Canyon Falls.  The last rappel down the falls proper is I think 80 feet, but maybe a bit more.  A knot chock and a natural arch down canyon left above the falls makes a great natural anchor for this beautiful rappel.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>FYI, the bottom of the falls is extraordinarily slippery.
