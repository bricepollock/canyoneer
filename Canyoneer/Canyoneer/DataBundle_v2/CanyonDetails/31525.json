  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>Other than Shop Creek, this is the other slot canyon I am aware of in\nthe area. While just barely long enough to make a worthwhile\ncanyoneering route, it is beautiful and exciting.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>You can get there from Erbie or the road down to Broadwater hollow.\nHike up (or down) Cecil Creek. You can approach via Hideout Hollow, or\nup ridges leaving from Cecil Creek on either side of Thunder Canyon. The\nterrain is pretty easy, at least in the cooler months before the\nundergrowth comes in.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>A short downclimb is encountered before the technical part of the\ncanyon. The first rappel is dry and simple, about 20 feet down off of a\ntree. The next is longer off a tree down a waterfall into a waist deep\npool above Thunder Canyon Falls. The last rappel down the falls proper\nis I think 80 feet, but maybe a bit more. A knot chock and a natural\narch down canyon left above the falls makes a great natural anchor for\nthis beautiful rappel.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>FYI, the bottom of the falls is extraordinarily slippery. There is\npretty hiking past or through some shallow slots downstream.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n",
