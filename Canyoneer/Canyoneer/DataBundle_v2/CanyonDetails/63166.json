{"description":"<div class=\"mw-content-ltr mw-parser-output\" lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><p>Whitehorse Creek is a tributary of the Hamma Hamma River and originates from Lake of the Angels, a high alpine lake in a basin at ~4900ft between Mt. Stone and Mt. Skokomish inside Olympic National Park. The creek passes out of the park, through the Mt. Skokomish Wilderness, and finally ends in Olympic National Forest. This page describes the section of Whitehorse Creek between ~1600 to 2600ft elevation. \n<\/p><p>Currently, there are two options:\n<\/p><p>1) Main Section:  This is the recommended route. Access is great, the rappels are fun, and this approach gets you right into the best part of the creek. Expect 7-10 rappels to 120ft.\n<\/p><p>2) Upper Whitehorse: Faster, experienced groups might enjoy this option which starts higher and adds about  6-8 rappels (short, but rapid-fire) in the upper canyon.\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading3\"><h3 id=\"Water_Flow\">Water Flow<\/h3><\/div>\n<p>The watershed is about 1.5mi^2 with the highest point being Mt. Stone at ~6400' elevation. Be aware: the upper basin above Lake of the Angels can hold snow well into July. The best time to visit the creek is probably July through September.\n<\/p>\n<ul><li>Checkpoint: It's possible to take a look at the creek just off the Hamma Hamma Road west of the Putvin Trailhead.  Be aware, the creek down here is large and swampy and this is not a good indicator of conditions higher up. Expect to find considerably more water in the creek. Another option might be to thrash in to take a look at the final waterfall on the creek (~5-10min from the road).<\/li><\/ul>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading3\"><h3 id=\"Main_Section\">Main Section<\/h3><\/div>\n<p>Follow the Putvin Trail upwards for 1.2mi (~800ft gain) to meet an old logging track. Follow the track west 100ft to a signpost (~2370ft) where the Putvin Trail continues upwards towards Lake the Angels. Instead of going up, continue down the road to a switchback. This is a good place to suit up.  When ready, bushwhack almost due west about 200ft, then descend carefully to the creek (losing about 100ft elevation) on the nose of a short ridge. If you find the right place, you should be able to enter the creek without need of a rope. You will drop in right above R9 as described in the beta below.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading3\"><h3 id=\"Upper_Whitehorse\">Upper Whitehorse<\/h3><\/div>\n<p>At the signpost described above, continue on up the Putvin Trail (becomes much steeper and rockier) for another 0.3mi ( 300ft gain) to ~2690ft elevation. At the trail's closest approach to the creek, it abruptly turns to the right (approx. 47.58625, -123.25359). Look straight ahead to find a faint user trail (possibly an old climber's trail?) that contours ahead, then drops down through the slide alder into the creek. It was a tad overgrown, but there was zero bushwhacking in July 2021. Suit up at the creek.\n<\/p>\n<ul><li>Note that USGS maps do not accurately show the location of the Putvin Trail.<\/li><\/ul>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>From beginning to end, Whitehorse is pretty action-packed. There's barely any walking at all before the next obstacle presents. Depending on comfort and flow, you might do more or less rappels.
