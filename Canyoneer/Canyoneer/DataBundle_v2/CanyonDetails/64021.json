  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>A beautiful and deep crack in the ground with an exciting first\nrappel into the maw of the canyon. It's short but oh so sweet.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>Once you arrive at Restaurante los golondrinas, pay the money for\nentrance and parking. tell the owner what you're doing and he'll point\nyou to the access trail. After maybe 10 minutes, you'll cross the creek\nand arrive at the tree at the edge of the cavern, which is the anchor\nfor the first rappel.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>R1: 30m into a dark swirling pool. anchor off a large tree RDC.\nprobably best to leave webbing here although it apparently gets removed\nfrequently. Pull can be difficult otherwise. Jump into a deep pool\nDownclimb around some boulders R2: 10m into a little grotto under an\narch. swim out through a little arch into the main flow R3: 15 m,\nanchored off of a tree RDC. Get off on a ledge partway down. It is\nobvious and heavily visited. If you go too far, you're going to have to\nfigure out how to climb back up.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>There is a super obvious trail back up to the parking area from the\nledge at the bottom of last rap.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<p>in April 2021 the owner (Aureliano: +52 775 105 1991) charged 100\npesos per person and 30 pesos per car.</p>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n",
