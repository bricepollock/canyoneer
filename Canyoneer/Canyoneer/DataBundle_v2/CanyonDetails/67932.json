  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>Canyon that could have some potential for fun elements, but for now\nit is full of trees.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>Follow the river on the southern side, first across the forest and\nthen a long slab. From time to time you can peak into the canyon.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>First part is made of slabs, if one day the canyon gets washed out,\nthis might become a paradise for slides. That part ends with a 20m\nwaterfall from which on there is 500m of walking in a bit more incised\nbut still not narrow section. After the waterlevel rises due to an\naffluent, there are a few narrow rappels, though after each one it is\npossible to get out. But, as long as there are branches and trunks\neverywhere, it's really not the most appealing canyon.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>Walk through the field and within 5min you're back at the car.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background_1\">Background</h2>\n",
