  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p><strong>Skellig Michael</strong>, <em>Sceilig Mhich√≠l</em> in Irish,\nrises over 700 feet above the ocean 7 miles off the southwest coast of\nIreland. This UNESCO World Heritage Site, along with neighboring Little\nSkellig, is an important breeding ground for Atlantic puffins, gannets,\ngulls, and petrels. It is also the site of a Christian monastery founded\nin the 6th century, the remains of which can be seen near the summit.\nThe monastery features a graveyard and stone beehive cells, and is\naccessed through a winding staircase of rough stones built into the\nsteep hillside. You may also recognize parts of the island from <em>Star\nWars: The Force Awakens</em>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>The number of visitors each day is limited to preserve the site;\ntherefore, one must book a boat ride, often weeks or months in advanced,\nwith a licensed operator. Boats for Skellig Michael leave from both\nPortmagee or Ballinskelligs, and range from poontoon boats to small\nfishing boats. Travel is weather dependent, with most boats only\noperating April through September. The eastern Atlantic can be rough and\noften crossings are not possible. There are no bathrooms and no\nfacilities on the island.</p>\n<p>Boats drop passengers off at the pier at East Landing. Pickup is\nusually 2-3 hours later. A paved road leads to the stone staircase where\nvisitors may climb to the Monastery. There is usually not enough time to\nvisit the Hermitage or the western side of the island. For conservation\npurposes, no one may leave the main trail. </p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><img src=\"rwl_en.png\" title=\"rwl_en.png\" alt=\"rwl_en.png\" /><a\nhref=\"http://brennen.caltech.edu/world/skelig.htm\">Chris Brennen's\nAdventure Hikes (World)</a> : Skellig Michael</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n",
