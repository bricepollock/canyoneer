Most of it can be jumped or done as a slide.\nPlease call the hydroelectric company to make sure that they aren't releasing water from the dam.\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>It starts with an open waterfall. An anchor is on the right, but from the big boulder on the left, it should be possible to jump in the small pool (6-7m).\nAfter 50m-100m of walking comes the most continuous section of the canyon.\nDownclimb 3-4m. Then comes a small rappel, you can also climb up on the right and jump from 8m.\nNext is a 10m-12m drop where you can slide down.\n<\/p><p>After another 50m-100m is a flat narrow Waterfall. Rappel halfway down on the right, and then slide or jump in the pool behind the whitewater.\n<\/p><p>To finish off, you'll find a 5m drop followed by the final Waterfall. Both can be jumped, but on the last one you'll need to reach the little nose in between the two water jets.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Red_tape\">Red tape<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Beta_sites\">Beta sites<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Background\">Background<\/h2><\/div>\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nParsed by mw‐api‐ext.codfw.main‐6779cc57fc‐8hkcj\nCached time: 20240914191827\nCache expiry: 2592000\nReduced expiry: false\nComplications: [show‐toc]\nCPU time usage: 0.007 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.008 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 21\/1000000\nPost‐expand include size: 0\/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 0\/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 2\/100\nExpensive parser function count: 0\/500\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0\/20\nUnstrip post‐expand size: 0\/5000000 bytes\nNumber of Wikibase entities loaded: 0\/400\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%    0.000      1 -total\n-->\n<\/div>","version":"822ae916754adc2ac15576b611c7f3d81ce92fe792835e57b24b0d67bd6563aa","permit":"No","timeRating":"I","vehicle":null,"url":"https:\/\/ropewiki.com\/Roflaschlucht","shuttleSeconds":null,"name":"Roflaschlucht","riskRating":null,"technicalRating":3}
