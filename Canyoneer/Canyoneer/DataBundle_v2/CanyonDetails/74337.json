Most of it can be jumped or done as a slide.\nPlease call the hydroelectric company to make sure that they aren't releasing water from the dam.\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>It starts with an open waterfall. An anchor is on the right, but from the big boulder on the left, it should be possible to jump in the small pool (6-7m).\nAfter 50m-100m of walking comes the most continuous section of the canyon.\nDownclimb 3-4m. Then comes a small rappel, you can also climb up on the right and jump from 8m.\nNext is a 10m-12m drop where you can slide down.\n<\/p><p>After another 50m-100m is a flat narrow Waterfall. Rappel halfway down on the right, and then slide or jump in the pool behind the whitewater.\n<\/p><p>To finish off, you'll find a 5m drop followed by the final Waterfall. Both can be jumped, but on the last one you'll need to reach the little nose in between the two water jets.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Red_tape\">Red tape<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Beta_sites\">Beta sites<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Background\">Background<\/h2><\/div>\n\n\n<\/div>","geojson":null,"url":"https:\/\/ropewiki.com\/Roflaschlucht","technicalRating":3,"id":74337,"riskRating":null,"vehicle":null,"timeRating":"I","rappelCountMin":6,"shuttleSeconds":null,"latitude":46.5767,"rappelCountMax":6,"waterRating":"C3","version":"22f151c73fc48e6ca917b1ac0d9b8ebb42e3f6219650f41756b01ad9fbd5f020","months":["Jun","Jul","Aug","Sep","Oct","Nov"],"name":"Roflaschlucht"}
