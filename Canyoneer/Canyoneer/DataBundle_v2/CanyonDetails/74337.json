  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>Short but impressive canyon, with big pools, known for its last\nwaterfall where you can walk behind it on a touristic path. Most of it\ncan be jumped or done as a slide. Please call the hydroelectric company\nto make sure that they aren't releasing water from the dam.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>It starts with an open waterfall. An anchor is on the right, but from\nthe big boulder on the left, it should be possible to jump in the small\npool (6-7m). After 50m-100m of walking comes the most continuous section\nof the canyon. Downclimb 3-4m. Then comes a small rappel, you can also\nclimb up on the right and jump from 8m. Next is a 10m-12m drop where you\ncan slide down.</p>\n<p>After another 50m-100m is a flat narrow Waterfall. Rappel halfway\ndown on the right, and then slide or jump in the pool behind the\nwhitewater.</p>\n<p>To finish off, you'll find a 5m drop followed by the final Waterfall.\nBoth can be jumped, but on the last one you'll need to reach the little\nnose in between the two water jets.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n"
