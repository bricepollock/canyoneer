  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>Yeah-baby Canyon is a short drive from Brisbane, making for a great\nday trip. The canyon includes 2x30m, 1x20m, 1x7m, and a few optional\n5-10m pitches. The canyon also boasts a sweet slide at the end (picture\ntop right).</p>\n<p>Usually dry, a very small catchment.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>Extremely dodgy natural anchors inplace. Caution all who dare\nenter.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>The walk out follows the stunning wide Guanaba Creek, hugged by a\nvibrant palm tree rainforest. Following this is a walk up a firetrail\nfrom the creek straight back to a car. A 15-minute car swap is\nrequired.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<p>Access to the canyon requires crossing private property. The exit\nrequires crossing the Guanaba Indigenous Protected Area which requires\npermission ahead of time. Consequently, due to the sensitivity the\ncanyon should not be completed.</p>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n",
