  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>This page describes a unique technical canyon located in the upper\nheadwaters of the Lewis River on the northwestern flanks of Mt. Adams.\nThe softer volcanic substrate yields narrows, potholes, waterfalls, and\na committing lower section making this a classic northwest canyon. It's\none of the prettier canyons in the area with striking orange/yellow\nrocks in the lower canyon.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Another option for entering the technical section is to come in via\n<a href=\"Babyshoe_Creek\" title=\"wikilink\">Babyshoe Creek</a>. This will\ndrop you in a few hundred yards above R2.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>The Lewis River valley is quite extensive, draining a significant\narea of Mt. Adams, the Dark Divide, and Indian Heaven plateau. This page\ndescribes the technical section of the river way up in the headwaters,\nbut there are many other technical canyons in the same watershed (ex:\nBig Creek, Cussed Hollow, Pin, Chickoon, etc). Most of these, however,\nare lesser tributaries of the Lewis River.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"water_flow\">Water Flow</h3>\n<p>Be aware: the Lewis River is glacial-fed from the snowfields high on\nMt. Adams. It may be running considerably higher than other creeks in\nthe area on hot summer days when a lot of melt is taking place high on\nthe mountain. The water is often colder and siltier than others in the\narea. When the water is running high, you may expect to encounter\nserious hydraulics in the technical section, including the dangerous\ncrux of the descent. This earns the canyon it's \"R\" rating. The most\ndangerous hydraulics can usually be bypassed by rappelling out of the\nwater or using alternate anchors.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>Park on either side of the upper bridge. Hop the guardrail on either\nside of the bridge and bushwhack your way upstream and down steep\nforested slopes to the creek.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>Be aware, some obstacles may be considerably more difficult in high\nflow. Please do not add webbing to unlinked bolts or leave fixed lines\nin the canyon. All jumps should be scouted first to ensure it's deep\nenough and there are no underwater obstacles.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>R1</strong> - 30ft from webbing around a log located right\nat the lip of the falls. Beware kicking down rocks when getting on\nrappel. (Alternatively, downclimb DCL through a slippery boulder\njam.)</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Downclimb DCL past an 8ft drop just after the waterfall.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Walk downstream about 0.3mi. The going is a classic Pacific NW\ncreek-walk at first, but becomes more interesting as the canyon walls\nstart to rise around you. Expect a couple minor downclimbs and\npools.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>R2</strong> - 10ft from single bolt located atop a large\nrock knob DCR or downclimb a narrow chute DCL. Babyshoe Creek enters DCR\nimmediately downstream of the rock knob.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>S1</strong> - 8ft slide or jump. Located immediately below\nR2. Usually very deep; the R2 bolt can be used to safely check for new\ndebris.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>R3 + traverse</strong> - 20ft traverse from a single bolt to\nan exposed bolt station DCR right at the brink. Rappel is 30ft in two\ntiers: 15ft to a waist-deep pool that is undercut DCL. The second tier\nturns DCR and the main flow is avoided by rappelling over the nose to a\n(relatively) dry landing.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>R4</strong> - 50ft in two tiers from an unlinked bolt\nstation DCR.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>::*<strong>R4a</strong> - First tier (30ft) is dry and out of the\nwater, landing in a chest-deep pool. The rope can be extended to\ncontinue down the second tier, which is right in the flow, but be aware\nthat the rope pull can be challenging from the bottom of the 2nd\ntier.</p>\n<p>::*<strong>R4b</strong> - 30ft from a hanging rebelay (unlinked bolt\nstation DCR). These bolts may be underwater at high flow. This hanging\nrebelay is an unpleasant place to be as the anchor manager, but it\nfacilitates an easier rope pull from the top tier. LAPAR should consider\ngoing double strand (when conditions are safe) as retrieving the rope\nfrom R4a can still be be difficult from the hanging rebelay. The line\nfrom the rebelay is outside of the flow to begin with and then right in\nthe heart of it for the last 10 feet. (Note: A DCL bolted anchor at the\ntop of the second drop was considered to provide a high flow line, but\nthe rock was deemed hollow and unsuitable for bolts. A bolted deviation\n10â€™ DCR from the hanging rebelay could potentially provide a great high\nflow line.)</p>\n<p>Immediately below R4 is a short slot. Sliding will drop you into the\ncenter of a surprisingly deep pothole. If jumping, keep your jump\nshallow as there's an underwater boulder 5ft downstream. As you round\nthe next corner, there are two short slides DCR. Probably only suitable\nfor mod/low flows. The first pool is undercut DCR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>R5</strong> - 45ft anchored via a long fixed rope from a\ntree high DCL. Protect against rope abrasion on the rocky protrusion\nDCL. The main flow channels DCR and taking a direct line will encounter\nthe full wrath of the jet.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>R6</strong> - 150ft in five tiers anchored from a small tree\nDCL. Much of the rope is needed for the horizontal distance. (To avoid\nthe crux, possibly rappel from a tree high DCR. A belay may be required\nto reach this anchor.)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>::* 1st tier: 25ft. In high water, this is the crux of the canyon\nwhere the current is directed into a pool that is 100% whitewater.\nRappel down and kick off the wall, attempting to land in the slack water\n\"eye\" of the pool and swim! As of July 2023, the crux is only\nwaist/chest deep.</p>\n<p>::* 2nd tier: Short drop into a curiously deep, small diameter\nhole.</p>\n<p>::* 3rd tier: 15ft into a shallow pool.</p>\n<p>::* 4th tier: 15ft. Either down a narrow chute DCL or a rockface DCR;\nboth into deep pools.</p>\n<p>::* 5th tier: 3ft. The last small drop can be jumped.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>R7</strong> - 70ft from a cairn DCR. Avoid entering the\nhanging pothole in the middle of the drop in high flow. It is possible\nto rappel directly in the watercourse for the second half of the drop or\nstay DCR to stay entirely dry.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Immediately after R7, there is a short jump into a seemingly benign\npool that is undercut. In higher flow, consider taking off your pack\nprior to jumping into the pool or have someone stationed at the edge to\nhelp pull anyone out.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Exit the technical section downclimbing a groove under a log\nDCL.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<h3 id=\"shuttle\">Shuttle</h3>\n<p>Continue downstream about 0.75mi to the FR-90 bridge. Expect the\nusual Pacific NW creek-walking and climbing over/around/through a few\nsizeable logjams. When possible, exit the creek DCL onto an open\nforested bench and continue downstream. The bridge will sneak up on you.\nThe hike downstream goes pretty quickly.</p>\n<h3 id=\"no_shuttle\">No Shuttle</h3>\n<p>Continue downstream ~0.3mi and exit DCR to gain a ridge. Follow the\nridge uphill until it intersects with one or more game trails. Follow\nthese game trails back east, paralleling the top of the canyon on the\nnorth side, until you, eventually, reach the upper parking area at the\nbridge.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<p>None.</p>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a\nhref=\"https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.10105264151220658&amp;type=1&amp;l=ee076275b0\">Facebook\nalbum from June 25, 2016</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n<p>First scout: Ken Leibert and Evan Topinka, October 13, 2013.
