  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>Another nice friendly canyon in Mt. Rainier National Park that\nparallels the seldom-visited East Side Trail. Chinook hosts a number of\nbeautiful falls, culminating in a big 130ft drop. Access is surprisingly\neasy. A competent fast-moving team could probably run this in 3-4hrs.\nChinook might be nice when combined with another short canyon in the\narea... possibly Panther Creek or Klickitat just down the road.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>From the parking area, take the East Side Trail downwards about\n0.5mi. Leave the trail and walk 500ft (it'd be a stretch to call it\nbushwhacking) into the creek just before the first drop. There is a nice\narea to suit up just before you drop in.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Checkpoint is the creek at the drop-in.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>Immediately below the place where you drop in, the adventure\nbegins.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>25ft low-angle drop. Downclimb DCR.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>R1 Double anchor DCL, 40'. Anchors are tucked on side of rock facing\ndown canyon.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>R2: Single anchor DCL. 40 foot of rope needed for the horizontal.\nTwo short drops through a fun narrow slot. (Might be downclimbed by the\nsure-footed in low water.)</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>R3: 70ft. Double anchor DCR tucked on side of rock facing down\ncanyon.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Two short drops maybe 10-15ft each. Downclimb the first DCR, the\nsecond DCL. (Or rappel.)</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>R4: 20ft from a single anchor DCR</li>\n</ul>\n<p>R5 and R6 compose <strong>Chinook Creek Falls</strong>. Given its\nmagnitude, bit surprising this falls doesn't have a legit trail leading\nto it.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>R5: Single anchor DCL. 40ft to a pool above the big drop.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>R6: Double anchor DCL. 100ft to a large platform at the base of the\nfalls.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Below the big falls, it's possible to downclimb through several more\nshort tiers (you may need to crisscross and climb out of the\nwatercourse), or rappel from any number of large boulders on either\nside. Pass through a shallow V-slot (entertaining) and another tier or\ntwo to a final pool with a great view back of the big falls. This ends\nthe technical section.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>After the last rappel, head downstream about 200yrds. The creek\ndegenerates here into a field of boulders, fallen logs and unstable\ndebris. Keep going until it's easy to step out of the creek into the\nforest DCR. In August 2020, there were several very large cut logs lying\nin the creek which were a good signal that you're at the exit. Look for\na faint user trail that leads up the slope all of 30 seconds to reach\nthe official East Side Trail. Again, no bushwhacking. Follow the East\nSide trail right/upwards about 1mi, 900ft gain back to the trailhead and\nyour waiting vehicles.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<p>None. You do not need to pay the MRNP entrance fee to access this\ncanyon.</p>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n<p>This canyon was first descended on July 7 of 2017 by Luca Chiarabini\nand Barry Specht and Tiffanie Lin.</p>\n",
