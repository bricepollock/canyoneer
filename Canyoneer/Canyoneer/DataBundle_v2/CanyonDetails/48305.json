Rainier National Park that parallels the seldom-visited East Side Trail.  Chinook hosts a number of beautiful falls, culminating in a big 130ft drop.  Access is surprisingly easy.  A competent fast-moving team could probably run this in 3-4hrs. Chinook might be nice when combined with another short canyon in the area... possibly Panther Creek or Klickitat just down the road.\n<\/p>\n<ul><li>Chinook Creek appears to have been bolted sometime prior to 2023. Please check local regs per bolting inside Mt. Rainier National Park. Illegal bolting leads to deteriorated relations between land managers and the local canyoning community.<\/li><\/ul>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>From the parking area, take the East Side Trail downwards about 0.5mi.  Leave the trail and walk 500ft (it'd be a stretch to call it bushwhacking) into the creek just before the first drop.  There is a nice area to suit up just before you drop in.\n<\/p>\n<ul><li>Checkpoint is the creek at the drop-in.<\/li><\/ul>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Immediately below the place where you drop in, the adventure begins.\n<\/p>\n<ul><li>25ft low-angle drop.  Downclimb DCR.<\/li><\/ul>\n<ul><li>R1 Double anchor DCR, 40'. Anchor is tucked on the side of rock facing down canyon.<\/li><\/ul>\n<ul><li>R2: Single anchor DCL. 40' of rope needed for the horizontal. Two short drops through a fun narrow slot.  (Might be downclimbed by the sure-footed in low water.)<\/li><\/ul>\n<ul><li>R3: 70ft.  Double anchor DCR tucked on side of rock facing down canyon.<\/li><\/ul>\n<ul><li>Two short drops maybe 10-15ft each.  Downclimb the first DCR, the second DCL.<\/li><\/ul>\n<ul><li>R4: 20ft from a single anchor DCR.<\/li><\/ul>\n<p>R5 and R6 compose <b>Chinook Creek Falls<\/b>. Given its magnitude, bit surprising this falls doesn't have a legit trail leading to it.\n<\/p>\n<ul><li>R5: Single anchor DCL. 40ft to a pool above the big drop.<\/li><\/ul>\n<ul><li>R6: Double anchor DCL. 100ft to a large platform at the base of the falls.<\/li><\/ul>\n<ul><li>R7: From the platform, rappel down two vertical tiers from pinch point under a boulder in the watercourse. 100ft of rope is needed per the horizontal distance. (Alternatively, both tiers can be downclimbed on one side or the other.)<\/li><\/ul>\n<ul><li>12ft drop. Careful downclimb DCR (may need partner assist) or rappel from a boulder DCL.<\/li><\/ul>\n<p>This ends the technical section. Be sure to look back for a great view of chinook Falls.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>After the last rappel, head downstream about 200yrds.  The creek degenerates here into a field of boulders, fallen logs and unstable debris.  Keep going until it's easy to step out of the creek into the forest DCR.  In August 2020, there were several very large cut logs lying in the creek which were a good signal that you're at the exit.  Look for a faint user trail that leads up the slope all of 30 seconds to reach the official East Side Trail.  Again, no bushwhacking.  Follow the East Side trail right\/upwards about 1mi, 900ft gain back to the trailhead and your waiting vehicles.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Red_tape\">Red tape<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>None.
