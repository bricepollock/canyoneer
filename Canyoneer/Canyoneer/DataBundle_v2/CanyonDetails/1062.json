class=\"mw-content-ltr mw-parser-output\" lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><p>Located right off the highway, with easy parking, just 40 minutes from Seattle, Change Creek is a highly traveled canyon. While neither the most scenic nor the most ambitious canyon in the region, it is a high value creek with rapid-fire rappels that provides a fun day for canyoners of all levels much of the year, thanks to the low elevation and small watershed. \n<\/p><p>With abundant natural anchors, Change Creek has a history of accumulating unsightly webbing in many places. Webbing has been found washed away, and areas around trees used as anchors have become eroded. A handful of individuals as well as organizations that teach canyoning have worked together to clean up rotten webbing, and establish low-impact anchors that still allow for options to rappel in the flow, or choose a dry line depending on your objectives. Change Creek is used frequently for teaching and training - informally by individuals as well as by organizations that teach canyoning and SAR teams. Having multiple options at each obstacle is important both for training purposes and for reducing the need for ad hoc anchors. \n<\/p><p>To help steward this important natural resource for everyone to enjoy please:\n<\/p>\n<ul><li>Do not remove any anchors that are listed in the beta<\/li>\n<li>Use the anchors in the beta - do not leave behind ad hoc anchors<\/li>\n<li>Replace damaged webbing &amp; hardware<\/li>\n<li>Leave unlinked bolts unlinked to prevent unnecessary flood damage<\/li><\/ul>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading3\"><h3 id=\"Waterflow\">Waterflow<\/h3><\/div>\n<p>The waterflow reference checkpoint is at the base of the last rappel. It can be seen &amp; examined from the flagged trail. For a closer look it can be accessed by bushwhacking down the slope to the streambed.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading3\"><h3 id=\"Drive\">Drive<\/h3><\/div>\n<p>From Interstate 90 Eastbound, take Exit 38. Turn right onto SE Homestead Valley Road. Just past the bridge over the South Fork Snoqualmie River, the road curves to the left. After 0.6 mi (1 km), proceed to the parking area on the left (northeast) side of the road.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading3\"><h3 id=\"Hike\">Hike<\/h3><\/div>\n<p>The approach hike will probably take 45-60 minutes. From the parking area, cross the road and proceed up the Deception Crags Trail, just northwest (DCL - looking Down the Canyon, on the Left) of Change Creek. Follow the trail under the old railroad bridge high above (now the Palouse to Cascades State Park Trail).\n<\/p><p>On the other side of the bridge the trail splits. Most people will be following the well-worn right fork to the popular rock climbing area. Instead turn left on to the lesser-worn trail which drops towards the creek. Start following the brightly colored marker-tape uphill, shadowing the creek the whole way. The final rappel of the route (which is used for water level reference) can be seen from halfway up the trail. Take care to follow the flagging. Social trails have been blocked with branches, but are still visible. Following the flagged trail will help prevent erosion of the loose slope. The trail continues to switch back-and-forth and vary in pitch, until you're lead straight into the creek above the first rappel.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Pools are shallow and do not offer any jumping opportunities.

Either option requires rope abrasion management over sharp rock.\n<ul><li><b>Option 1<\/b>: 70ft from unlinked bolts in center. There is sharp rock so creep the rope.
