Before the bridge over the river and before the village Marigot on the other side of the river we turn right and drive at the orograf. left bank in northeastern direction. After 4.4 km on partly repaired and narrow paved road - uphill and downhill - we reach a dead end just after a little closed shack on the left side of the roadway. Park there and follow the road to the creek, about 50 meters walk. Head down the creek past the drainage pipes.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>There are 5 small rappels, one of which is very nice. Very low trickle of water, and little evidence that this stream ever gets more.  It is more of a creek\/ditch than a canyon. You will be ducking overgrown tree limbs in the watercourse.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>After a little more than an hour you will see a bamboo forest on the left. There are some stairs and a dirt road a little past that that you can follow all the way to where you parked your car (lower shuttle car).  If you did not park a shuttle vehicle you will need to walk a kilometer or two back up to your car at the start.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Red_tape\">Red tape<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Beta_sites\">Beta sites<\/h2><\/div>\n<ul><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http:\/\/descente-canyon.com\/canyoning\/canyon-description\/21793\">Descente-Canyon.com<\/a> &#160;: Dufour<\/li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http:\/\/canyon.carto.net\/cwiki\/bin\/view\/Canyons\/RavineDufourCanyon\">Canyon.Carto.net<\/a> &#160;: Dufour<\/li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http:\/\/ankanionla-madinina.com\/Guadeloupe\/Basse%20Terre\/Ravine%20Dufour%20ou%20Ti-Punch.htm?kmlidxna\">An Kanion La-madinina<\/a> &#160;: Ravine Dufour ou Ti-Punch<\/li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http:\/\/ankanionla-madinina.com\/Files\/Other\/Guadeloupe\/Liste%20rivieres%20et%20ravines%20de%20guadeloupe1%20.pdf?id=G-4&amp;kmlidx=16.1075:-61.7255:16.1089:-61.7315\">An Kanion La-madinina<\/a> &#160;: Ravine Dufour ou la Ti Punch [G-4]<\/li><\/ul>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Background\">Background<\/h2><\/div>\n\n\n<\/div>","technicalRating":3,"id":14549,"vehicle":null,"rappelCountMax":6,"longitude":-61.7349,"rappelLongestMeters":25,"waterRating":"B","version":"044c3f5bff653f2bd8e1ba9e9d822198505f642ab916c2b8634e72a96b4cf1b3","name":"Dufour","quality":3,"riskRating":null,"shuttleSeconds":null}
