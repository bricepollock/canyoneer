One can see this canyon when driving up the 330 to Big Bear and surrounding communities. There are several other undocumented\/unexplored canyons in the area. Though this is in the San Berdoos, it is similar to San Gabe frontrange canyons in character, with low water flow. There are about 8 rappels. Several dropos that appeared to be moderate downclimbs were rappelled instead.\n<\/p><p>The first rappel was 200ft down a low-angle loose slope that wasn't really a good downclimb. The anchor is a deadman. It is located at our dropin, just downstream of very thick Poison oak and other foliage and upstream of where things turned a bit more arid.\n<\/p><p>We carried a 200ft rope and 200ft pullcord for the descent. I do not recall if it would be wiser to use different equipment.\n<\/p><p>The name comes from Ty and Taco, thus T2.\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Please note the turnout west northwest of the point on the map (coordinates). This is where we parked. We hiked down the road and then down to the riverbed by way of some waterflow control pipes or whatnot.
