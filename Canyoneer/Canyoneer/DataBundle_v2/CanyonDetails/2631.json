One can see this canyon when driving up the 330 to Big Bear and surrounding communities. There are several other undocumented\/unexplored canyons in the area. Though this is in the San Berdoos, it is similar to San Gabe frontrange canyons in character, with low water flow. There are about 8 rappels. Several dropos that appeared to be moderate downclimbs were rappelled instead.\n<\/p><p>The first rappel was 200ft down a low-angle loose slope that wasn't really a good downclimb. The anchor is a deadman. It is located at our dropin, just downstream of very thick Poison oak and other foliage and upstream of where things turned a bit more arid.\n<\/p><p>We carried a 200ft rope and 200ft pullcord for the descent. I do not recall if it would be wiser to use different equipment.\n<\/p><p>The name comes from Ty and Taco, thus T2.\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Please note the turnout west northwest of the point on the map (coordinates).
