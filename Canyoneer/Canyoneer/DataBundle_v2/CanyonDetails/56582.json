  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>Magic Box Canyon (officially <a\nhref=\"https://apps.gov.bc.ca/pub/bcgnws/names/548.html\">Box Canyon\nCreek</a>) is a big, scenic canyon that features rapid-fire rappels and\nseemingly endless deep, beautiful pools. While the movement and\ntechnical requirements of this canyon at moderate flow are\nbeginner-friendly, the scale and commitment are not. It demands a high\nlevel of team efficiency with a 2+ hour approach, 20+ drops, slippery\nterrain, prolonged exposure to cold water, and a 1.5 hour exit. For\ntheir efforts, teams are rewarded with fun rappels in friendly flow, an\nexciting slide, several good jumps, and stunning scenery.</p>\n<p>Box Canyon Creek (not to be confused with <a\nhref=\"Box_Canyon_(British_Columbia)\" title=\"wikilink\">Box Creek</a>, a\ntributary of Monmouth Creek just 20km to the NE) is located near Howe\nSound within Sunshine Coast Regional District, British Columbia —\napproximately 24km SW of Squamish and 22km NNW of Horseshoe Bay. The\ndrainage basin is on the east side of Box Canyon Peak (1379m), and the\ncreek flows east to its confluence with McNab Creek.</p>\n<p>This canyon uses many natural anchors such as logs, root balls,\ntrees, and rock pinches. Teams should come prepared with plenty of\nwebbing and quick links, and the first team through in a season should\nbring bolts. Much of the canyon’s walls are sheer, and when log jams are\nwashed away, few anchor options remain. Due to the remoteness and\nwilderness character of this canyon, teams should be prepared to\nproblem-solve.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<h3 id=\"water_crossing\">Water crossing</h3>\n<p>No road exists to access the canyon from the Vancouver/Squamish side.\nFor most folks, this will necessitate crossing Howe Sound. These are\nsome options:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Water taxi\n<ul>\n<li>from Squamish: 20 min trip. Contact <a\nhref=\"http://squamishmarineservices.com/\">Squamish Marine\nServices</a>.</li>\n<li>from Horseshoe Bay: 40 min scenic trip, winding around Gambier\nIsland and Anvil Island. Contact <a\nhref=\"https://mercurytransport.ca/services/charter-water-taxi/\">Mercury\nTransport</a> (confirmed 3 Sep 2023), <a\nhref=\"https://sunshinecoastwatertaxi.ca/\">Sunshine Coast Water Taxi</a>,\nor <a href=\"https://www.cormorantwatertaxi.com/\">Cormorant\nMarine</a>.</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>Sea kayak</li>\n</ul>\n<dl>\n<dt></dt>\n<dd>\n<dl>\n<dt></dt>\n<dd>\nPut in at Porteau Cove, and head directly west for 11km, skirting around\nthe eastern edge of Anvil Island. Note that there is vessel traffic, and\nthe sea can get very rough when the winds pick up. Not recommended for\nthose who are without skill and experience in sea kayaking.\n</dd>\n</dl>\n</dd>\n</dl>\n<h3 id=\"road_walk\">Road walk</h3>\n<p>There are many large animals that inhabit this area: bears, cougars,\nelk, and wolves. Take care, and ideally travel with a group.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>From the McNab Creek dock, walk along the flat McNab FSR 10209 01\nroad heading north to the bridge over Box Canyon Creek. This is the\nlocation of the waterflow checkpoint and where you will exit the creek\nafter the descent. <em>(2.4km)</em></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Proceed past the powerhouse and substation (staying on the main road\nto the left), then turn left onto Box Canyon FSR 10209 02 to begin the\nascent. <em>(1km)</em></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Box Canyon FSR 10209 02 quickly turns south, then switches back\nnorth, then south again as it climbs up to 560m elevation. At this\npoint, the road gradually bends West. Proceed past a small structure and\na large clearing on the left to where the road meets the forest on the\nleft side. <em>(4.2km)</em></li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"bushwhack\">Bushwhack</h3>\n<p>Enter the forest, quickly losing elevation as you descend the steep\nand mostly open forest floor. Cliffs are present on both sides, so use\ncaution in choosing your route. Placing a rope around a downed log near\nthe bottom can be useful as a handline. <em>(220m, -80m elev.)</em></p>\n<h4 id=\"alternate_bushwhack_unconfirmed\">Alternate Bushwhack\n(unconfirmed)</h4>\n<p>This is an unconfirmed but likely much less steep option, with the\ntradeoff of an additional 300m of stream walking.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Continue on the flat road. <em>(240m)</em></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Enter the forest, and bushwhack to the creek. ''(100m, -30m\nelev.)</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Stream walk. <em>(300m, -40m elev.)</em></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>R1 - 6m/20ft DCL webbing around boulder, or downclimb from canyon\nleft to right <strong>(needs two bolts for convenience/high\nwater)</strong></p>\n<p>R2 - 14m/45ft DCL two unlinked bolts</p>\n<p>Stream walk 300m/1,000ft</p>\n<p>R3 - 26m/85ft DCR webbing around fallen log 6m/20ft back.\n<strong>This is not a slide.</strong> This rappel follows an angled\nchute into a large, cold, deep infinity pool that’s about 30m/100ft\nlong. The exit from this pool is likely to be very challenging at high\nflow. It may require an extension of the rope from R3 to safely access\nthe the R4 anchor at the pour-over.</p>\n<p>R4 - 15m/50ft DCR single bolt <strong>(needs second bolt for\nredundancy)</strong></p>\n<p>Carefully traverse over or around an unstable log jam.</p>\n<p>R5 - 15m/30ft DCL webbing around tree</p>\n<p>R6/J1 - 8m/25ft human anchor or jump 5m/15ft into a large, deep pool.\nClearing a jagged ledge is not very difficult, but the launch is\nslippery, and clearing the ledge is mandatory.</p>\n<p>R7/S1 <em>“Decapitation Slide”</em> - 13m/40ft DCL two unlinked\nbolts, or 11m/35ft vertical slide. So named due to a large log that\nspans the far side of the channel. <strong>This slide is extremely fast,\nand checking for depth and obstacles is highly recommended if attempting\nit.</strong> The anchor station is located on a large boulder at the top\nof the waterfall, just above the high-water line, and puts the rope\ndirectly in the path of the slide. If you make the decision to slide,\nstart from a position just slightly DCR of the center of the\nwatercourse, thus avoiding a ledge/bump about halfway down that is\nslightly DCL of the center of the watercourse. In 2023, the log in the\npool did not present a hazard, but at least one canyoner made\n(non-injurious) contact with the DCL wall. </p>\n<p>R8/J2 - 5m/15ft human anchor, or climb up DCL to jump 7m/20ft</p>\n<p>R9/J3 - 8m/25ft DCR two unlinked bolts, or 8m/25ft technical jump\ninto 2.5m/8ft deep pool with boulders on either side 1m/3ft below the\nwater. Landing zone is 1.3m/4ft wide.</p>\n<p>Travel 60m/200ft through a scenic corridor to a short but impassable\nwaterfall.</p>\n<p>J4 - 3m/8ft traverse DCR on easy scramble terrain to a flat launch.\nJump to the center of the pool, avoiding a log in the center, and\nboulders on the right.</p>\n<p>J5 - 5m/15ft DCL, or downclimb DCR to 3m/8ft jump</p>\n<p>R10 - 14m/45ft DCR two unlinked bolts on a mossy outcrop. Complete as\ntwo-stage rappel, or rappel 8m/25ft and then jump into the large, deep\npool.</p>\n<p>R11 - 17m/55ft webbing around log. Two-stage rappel - 5m/15ft into\npool followed by 12m/40ft vertical pitch.</p>\n<p>R12 <em>“The Grotto”</em> - 23m/75ft DCL two unlinked bolts. Vertical\npitch into a massive grotto with 150m/500ft walls. </p>\n<p>R13 - 4m/12ft DCR webbing on a pinch point in a cave</p>\n<p>R14 <em>“The Magic Crack”</em> rebelay sequence. This is the\ntechnical crux of the canyon.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>30m/100ft DCL webbing around tree. Scramble up DCL 15m/50ft to reach\nthe tree which is situation just downstream of the pour-over.\nOptionally, send a confident climber to place a fixed line to the anchor\ntree to aid progression for the rest of the group. Beware of loose rock\non the descent, and traverse downstream (rappeler's right) to reach the\nrebelay station.</li>\n<li>20m/60ft DCL two unlinked bolts with ring hangers. The rebelay is on\na smooth, mostly vertical wall with no ledge to stand on. Descend into\nthe crack and swim the long, deep pool.</li>\n</ul>\n<dl>\n<dt></dt>\n<dd>\nOn the first descent, rather than scrambling up DCL, the team rappelled\noff a log into the pool created by a large, house-sized boulder, and\nclimbed up DCR under the club-shaped log (webbing remains on that log).\nIn 2021, the space below the log has been filled in, and moving a team\nup and over the log would have been extremely challenging. Additionally,\nthe FD team’s 2nd pitch in the crack was from a jammed root ball that\nhas since been washed away.\n</dd>\n<dd>\nIn order to descend in the watercourse, well-thought out, sustainable\nanchor stations would be required.\n</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>R15 - 23m/75ft DCL single bolt. Rappel in fun, friendly flow around a\ncorner. Earn points by going down first and taking pictures of your\nfriends as they descend possibly the most photogenic waterfall of the\ncanyon. <strong>(needs second bolt for redundancy)</strong></p>\n<p>R16 <em>“Log Deviation”</em> - 8m/25ft DCR webbing around log. Rappel\ninto a big deep pool. In 2019 and 2021, the end of a log could be used\nas a deviation for a cleaner rappel and to avoid rope abrasion.</p>\n<p>R17 <em>“Crooked Falls”</em> - 12m/35ft webbing around log. Rappel\ndown a slippery slab. The water makes a distinctive 90 degree turn\ncreating a sideways rooster tail.</p>\n<p>R18 - 7m/20ft DCL webbing around tree 5m/15ft up</p>\n<p>R19 - 10m/30ft webbing around a pinch in the watercourse</p>\n<p>R20 - 26m/85ft DCR single bolt. Out of the flow. <strong>(needs\nsecond bolt for redundancy)</strong></p>\n<p>R21/J6 - 10m/30ft DCL webbing around boulder, or 8m/25ft jump</p>\n<p>R22 - 12m/35ft DCL tree, or downclimb and partner capture\n<strong>(needs two bolts for convenience/high water)</strong></p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<h3 id=\"stream_walk\">Stream walk</h3>\n<p>The final rappel is followed by a long stream walk with lots of\nboulder hopping, downclimbing, and a few pools. When you see the power\nlines overhead, you're about 5-10 minutes from the bridge. Stay in the\nwatercourse all the way to the bridge for a clean exit up cement blocks\nDCL. Most groups will take about 45-75 minutes depending on energy\nlevel. <em>(675m, -125m elev.)</em></p>\n<h3 id=\"road_walk_1\">Road walk</h3>\n<p>From the bridge, turn right on McNab FSR 10209 01 and proceed south\nto the McNab Creek dock. <em>(2.4km)</em></p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<p>The McNab Creek dock and the area along McNab FSR 10209 01 going\nnorth is private land all the way to Box Canyon FSR 10209 02.
