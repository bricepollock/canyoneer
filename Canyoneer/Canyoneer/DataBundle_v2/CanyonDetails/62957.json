class=\"mw-content-ltr mw-parser-output\" lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><p>Fixed arrow is a route down the large alcove system on the North side of Twin Buttes. \n<\/p><p>This is not a technical canyon or slot, but rather 2 large drops from the top of east Twin Buttes to Broken Arrow trail. \n<\/p><p>This is an excellent short adventure for those new to technical hiking and rappeling.\n<\/p><p>The location also makes this a quick and easy adventure for those wanting a break from four wheeling on Broken Arrow.\n<\/p><p>Enjoy pink jeeps full of spectators and  watch for hikers below as you descend this small but scenic slick rock water course.\n<\/p><p><br \/>\n\"This is a perfect 2-hour outing for people who have just spent the first part of their day getting Reiki and having their soul harvested by a recently divorced woman in her mid 50's who just moved from Orange County and changed her name (not legally) from Sarah Lipkowitz to Shadow Moon Raven. She definitely also drives a PT Cruiser.\"\n-Rumi\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Park at the Broken Arrow trailhead located at the east end of Morgan Road (rough dirt road that most cars can handle...especially rental cars or cars borrowed from in-laws). \n<\/p><p>Head south on Broken Arrow trail for .2 miles. \n<\/p><p>Turn right (still south, but not as much) onto Twin Buttes trail for .6 miles.\n<\/p><p>Turn right (west) onto Hog Heaven for about .3 miles.\n<\/p><p>Turn right (north) onto a well worn use trail right before you begin to descend on Hog Heaven. If you start downhill towards 179 on Hog Heaven then you have gone too far. Continue on the use trail towards the red rock summit spire. The trail will weave closely around the left (west) side of the spire. Consider taking some time to do the easy scramble up the north side of the spire so you can get your jumping-star and warrior-one Instagram pics.\n<\/p><p>Continue north beyond the spire and head downhill. Your goal is a wide-open slickrock platform with a drainage in the middle.  \n<\/p><p>Once you are down in the drainage look for the small, lone tree that is just LDC of the water course. This is the anchor for the first rap. You will be able to see the Broken Arrow trailhead (where you started) from this tree. That's how short this day is.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p><b>R1<\/b>: 90’ from a small tree to the left of the water course (LDC). This is the ONLY anchor, so treat it well (or bolt it if you have the stuff). This drops you onto a nice sized ledge. \n<\/p><p><b>R2<\/b>: 60’ from a high branch on a solid tree. Keep the anchor high to avoid raining choss down on the pull. There are a LOT of other possibilities for natural anchors including massive boulders, large rock piles and healthy trees. Once you are down just head north (LDC) on some steep slickrock to the Hog Wash trail. Turn right (east) onto Hog Wash and hike about .3 miles to the Broken Arrow trail. Turn left (north) on Broken Arrow and hike .2 miles to the Broken Arrow trailhead. \n<\/p><p>R3 OPTIONAL: If you set R2 to the right (RDC) of the ledge you can rap down about 70 feet to another ledge and then set up a 20-foot R3 from a tree down to the drainage.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Once you are down R2 just head north on some steep slickrock to the Hog Wash trail.

You don't need any parking pass for the Broken Arrow trailhead since it is not a developed trailhead. It is a very popular trailhead and fills up quickly. There is NO PARKING along Jordan Road. Please respect the No Parking signs because rich, old people live there and will definitely have your car towed in order to give meaning and purpose to their lives.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Beta_sites\">Beta sites<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>realultimatepower.net\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Background\">Background<\/h2><\/div>\n\n\n<\/div>","technicalRating":3,"rappelCountMin":2,"rappelLongestMeters":27.43,"longitude":-111.7595,"quality":1.7}
