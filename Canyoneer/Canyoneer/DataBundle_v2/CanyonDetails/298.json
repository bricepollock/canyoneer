{"vehicle":"4WD - High Clearance","latitude":38.0583,"quality":4,"rappelCountMin":0,"url":"https:\/\/ropewiki.com\/Stair_Canyon_(Upper)","months":["Dec","Jan","Feb","Mar","Apr","May","Jun","Jul","Aug","Sep","Oct","Nov"],"description":"<div class=\"mw-content-ltr mw-parser-output\" lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><p>Head of the route is 38.05891, -110.43273. The best part of Upper Stair is bottom section after passing by two open sections each with an early exit on the right. Upper Stair starts out mildly with several easy downclimbs and small silos and swirls. The bottom section, which starts at 38.05311, -110.43698, is where the goods are. Below this point is a short narrows with high-stemming up to 40-feet and a couple high silo crossings. It is not possible to go low all the way through. This is a real R-rated slot canyon. The upper section is so short it is not worth doing this canyon unless you are doing the full route described here.\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Park your vehicle at 38.05676, -110.43901, by driving on the dirt road past Main Butler until it gets to a Tee. Make a sharp right hand turn and go until the end where it is blocked by a branch road block before it gets into deep un-maintained sand. This will make the exit hike as short as possible. From here, hike 1\/4 mile up the dirt road you just came down, then head south to the obvious head of the canyon.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>The crux is the final 200 feet of the bottom section. In the bottom section it is possible to stay low for the first half, but you will be forced up high. There are several silo crossings in the crux, while only one is mandatory, but they are all secure and at a reasonable width at the top.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Exit right here 38.05174, -110.43887. Requires a 5.6 climbing move to get up the first 15 feet. Then it's fairly straightforward. Stay left of a huge fault with a steep rock-fall on it's north end. Follow the slickrock in the middle for the easiest way up. There is a somewhat exposed 5.5 climb for about 100 feet.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Red_tape\">Red tape<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Beta_sites\">Beta sites<\/h2><\/div>\n<ul><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http:\/\/bluugnome.com\/cyn_route\/north-wash\/north-wash_upper-stair\/north-wash_upper-stair.aspx\">BluuGnome.com<\/a> &#160;: Upper Stair Canyon<\/li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http:\/\/roadtripryan.com\/go\/t\/utah\/north-wash\/upperstair\">RoadTripRyan.com<\/a> &#160;: Upper Stair Canyon<\/li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http:\/\/hikearizona.com\/decoder.php?ZTN=16392&amp;kmlidxna\">HikeArizona.com<\/a> &#160;: Stair Canyon<\/li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http:\/\/ropewiki.com\/User:Super_Amazing_Map?id=Stair_Canyon_-_North_Wash\">Super Amazing Map<\/a> &#160;: Stair Canyon<\/li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http:\/\/climb-utah.com\/Powell\/upperstair.htm\">Climb-Utah.com<\/a> &#160;: Upper Stair Canyon -
