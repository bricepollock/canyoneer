  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>Rather well hidden canyon as it finishes 300m above the level of the\nmain valley. That's why it's more convenient to park at the top of the\ncanyon. It starts with small open waterfalls and continously gets more\ninteresting. Best part is going down the 50m Waterfall, which looks\nquite spectacular from the top. Be careful, the rock is not very stable\nsometimes.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n"
