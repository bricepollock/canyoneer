  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>Holy Cow is an adventure that requires work and teamwork. It requires\nadvanced canyoneering techniques as there are no fixed anchors in place.\nIt is a pretty canyon, one of my favorites in the Escalante area. We\nused pothole scape tools, fiddlesticks, sandtraps, and possible water\nanchors if full of water. Longest Rap is 100' We did the canyon two\nweeks after the last precipitation in the fall and we still required\nwetsuits with the water level in one pothole to the chest.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>The approach from the parking lot follows a well-marked trail until\nyou find a distinctive large rock (37.77351, -111.19230), you need to\nturn right and look for the uphill approach. You will be able to\nidentify the ledge (37.77469, -111.19705) that you need to take to get\nto the next level. It is a ledge that a good climber will have no\nproblem to ascend and others may need assistance. It is exposed. Once\nover the edge, you will go west finding your way through the cross fins\nto the top (37.77511, -111.19929). Continue northwest until you get into\nthe drainage of Holy Cow (37.77642, -111.20231) keep following the\ndrainage until you get to the technical area.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>I will not spoil the canyon with details, sufficiently to know that\nyou will need: experience with retrievable anchors (we used fiddle\nstick), potshots sometimes we used mud/pebbles instead of sand, people\nable to pull themselves out of potholes, sandtraps -in one rappel we\nused the sandtrap hanging above water (water anchor is a substitute)-.\nThere are a couple of narrow sections at the end, for large\npeople/backpacks it is possible to stem up. Beautiful scenery and\nformation with a very distinguishing place with 3 arches and subway\nformation. You finish the canyon with the longest rappel.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>The exit is to find your way down through rocks and boulders to the\nriver wash, find the trail, and follow west. At some point, you will\nreach the big rock where you turned right for the approach. Continue\nnortheast until you reach the parking lot.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><img src=\"rwl_en.png\" title=\"rwl_en.png\" alt=\"rwl_en.png\" /><a\nhref=\"http://bluugnome.com/cyn_route/escalante/escalante_holy-cow/escalante_holy-cow.aspx\">BluuGnome.com</a>\n: Holy Cow Canyon</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<p><a\nhref=\"http://amazingslots.blogspot.com/2017/10/holy-cow-canyon.html\">October\n7th, 2017</a> : Holy Cow Canyon</p>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n",
