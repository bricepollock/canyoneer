  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>Bizarre slot canyon / narrows carved out through compacted pumice on\nSW slopes of Crater Lake. There may be water running earlier in the\nseason, but it dries up heading into late summer. A helmet is essential\nper constant rockfall hazard. In visiting in late summer 2014, there was\na constant light stream of fine gravel and pebbles coming down from\nabove. The canyon may be more dangerous in wet conditions.</p>\n<p>Visiting the narrows is short &amp; sweet. Expect to spend a couple\nof hours. It's usually an out &amp; back.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>From the junction with the south entrance to Crater Lake, head west\non Hwy 62 for 3.8mi. At 3.5mi, Whitehorse Creek passes through a culvert\nunderneath the road. It's easy to miss, so watch your mileage. Continue\n0.3mi further west to a parking pullout on the north side of the\nroad.</p>\n<p>From the parking area, backtrack along Hwy 62 to the creek and thrash\nnorth along the east side of the Whitehorse Creek. Keep going for 0.25mi\nand use an obvious side drainage to enter the creek. Go downstream.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>Follow the creek downstream as it entrenches and slots up in the\ncompacted pumice.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>R1: 10ft. In 2014 used a large log as an anchor to rap down. Set a\nfixed rope if you are planning to return the same way.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Below the canyon stays tight for a short distance with some easy\ndownclimbs before opening up into a nice narrows with overhanging walls\nand a big alcove. Continue downstream to reach the confluence with\nCastle Creek. Reportedly huge blocks of snow can be found here into late\nsummer.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>Return the way you came. Be prepared to re-ascend your rope.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<p>None.</p>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><img src=\"rwl_en.png\" title=\"rwl_en.png\" alt=\"rwl_en.png\" /><a\nhref=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20210527212206/www.canyoneeringnorthwest.com/LlaosHallwayWhitehorse/Llaos_Hallway_-_Whitehorse_Creek.php\">CanyoneeringNorthwest.com\n(archive.org)</a> : Llaos Hallway - Whitehorse Creek</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n<h2 id=\"further_explorations\">Further Explorations</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>It might be possible to head up or downstream on Castle Creek and\nthrash out elsewhere to do a loop.</li>\n<li>Little Castle Creek looks interesting.</li>\n</ul>\n",
