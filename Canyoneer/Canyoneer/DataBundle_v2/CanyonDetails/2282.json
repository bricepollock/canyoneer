There may be water running earlier in the season, but it dries up heading into late summer.  A helmet is essential per constant rockfall hazard.  In visiting in late summer 2014, there was a constant light stream of fine gravel and pebbles coming down from above.  The canyon may be more dangerous in wet conditions.\n<\/p><p>Visiting the narrows is short &amp; sweet.  Expect to spend a couple of hours.

Continue 0.3mi further west to a parking pullout on the north side of the road.\n<\/p><p>From the parking area, backtrack along Hwy 62 to the creek and thrash north along the east side of the Whitehorse Creek.
