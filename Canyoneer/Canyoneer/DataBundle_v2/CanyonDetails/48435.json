At least three rappels up to 160ft. Cover photo is the big falls.\n<\/p><p>Creek is a good one for early season trips. When the flow is right, the canyon is really fun. There are no deep pools or swimming.  Once the vegetation leafs out, there will be a lot more bushwhacking in the creek.\n<\/p><p>Water levels drop significantly heading into summer with the two upper drops totally drying up and the spring-fed lower drop running low.\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Park at B-5000, but do not to block the gate. This land was recently purchased by SDS logging and is open to hiking unless there is a fire ban (they have their own system independent of the state) - or they have active logging signs indicating to stay out. Walk up the road until you get to the first big right bend and then walk up a spine to about 1,900ft elevation. This is the bushwhacking route. The ridge is a great place to suit up.\n<\/p>\n<ul><li>Alternate Approach:  Follow the road up to Jct 2076 and then take the side road (somewhat overgrown) over to the creek and drop in from above. This reduces the bushwhacking considerably and may add  1 short rappel.<\/li><\/ul>\n<p>Bushwhack route: From the ridge when the trees open up to a rocky area, hike down to R2 or keep following the ridge and work your way down to R1. The hillside is a boulder field so be mindful of those below you. We walked in a staggered diagonal fashion to avoid  getting hit be a loose rock.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<ul><li>R1:  20ft sloper.<\/li><\/ul>\n<ul><li>R2:  90ft from bolts DCR.

Awesome overhung rappel.  From the anchor, route the rope on the creek side of the log, 2 teams have had core shots in 2023 and we think its the last rappel. This has been descended a lot with no creeping and no core shots so it seems the rock has changed. The last rope was damaged in 3 spots, area 27-32 feet from the anchor. Rope creep this rappel!<\/li><\/ul>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>From the big falls, hike downstream maybe 0.25mi until you encounter a large upright old-growth snag right out in the middle of the creek bed.  Bushwhack out DCL wherever is easiest to find an overgrown road grade. Follow the mostly-level old grade that heads down around the nose of the ridge to eventually meet up with the original road you hiked in on.\n<\/p>\n<ul><li>Alternately, just continue downstream another 0.25mi to reach Hwy 141.<\/li><\/ul>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Red_tape\">Red tape<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Wieberg Creek lies on land owned by SDS lumber.
