  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>Fisher Creek is a tributary of the North Fork Tilton River outside\nMorton, WA. We suspect this creek is best in spring and fall when\nthere's a good bit of water. The encroaching vegetation on the sides\nsuggests that Fisher runs very low by mid-summer. If water levels are\nlow, you might be better off continuing on up to <a\nhref=\"http://ropewiki.com/Wallanding_Creek\">Wallanding Creek</a> further\nup the road.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Use caution in the late season as there appears to be a lot of\nhunters in the area.</li>\n<li>Checkpoint is the place where FR 73 crosses Fisher Creek.</li>\n<li>Watershed: 0.75mi^2.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"directions\">Directions</h2>\n<p>From Morton, follow WA-508 west for 3.8mi. Turn off on FR 73 passing\na scary burned-out RV (this must be the bad side of Morton) for about\n1.5mi up through a clear cut to a junction. Bear left here to stay on FR\n73 for 1.2mi (road drops down to cross a bridge over the river) to\nFisher Creek. There are pullouts near the creek with room for several\nvehicles. Road has a bunch of potholes, but probably okay for 2WD\nvehicles driven with care.</p>\n<p>To reach the upper trailhead: continue north on FR 73 for 0.9mi to a\nY-jct. Bear left for 0.2mi to another junction and left again on FR 7106\nfor 1.1mi. Park at the large obvious switchback on the road at about\n2168' elevation.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>From the switchback, head south, taking the path of least resistance\ndown into a minor tributary creek that leads you down into Fisher Creek.\nThe tributary some minor downclimbing but was largely open and\nbrush-free. Approach to the creek takes about 5-10min. You'll drop in\njust below a minor 8ft drop just upstream. (No, there are no more drops\nupstream... we checked.)</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>Fisher Creek has a large number of short drops. You may end out doing\nmore or less rappels depending your comfort level. The original team\nrappelled at least two drops just because they looked fun. There are a\nfew pools, but mostly chest-deep or less.</p>\n<p>The technical sequence begins with a downclimb DCR around some logs\nto the top of R1.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>R1: 15ft drop. Anchored on a tree on the right. Possibly could be\ndownclimbed DCL.</li>\n<li>Logjam #1: downclimb or rappel 15ft far DCL against the canyon\nwall.</li>\n<li>Logjam #2: downclimb 20ft DCR. Worm your way over, under and through\nthe jam.</li>\n<li>R2: 15ft. Thin tree DCL.</li>\n<li>R3: Two-tier falls: 35ft, 15ft. Rappel both from same anchor DCL.\nThe lower tier has an interesting chute DCR that can be\ndownclimbed.</li>\n<li>R4: Two-tier falls: 25ft, 20ft. Rappel both from same anchor\nDCR.</li>\n<li>R5: The creek swings right and narrows up, with the entire creek\nbeing channeled into a low-angle chute. A rope may be a good idea here\nfor safety. There's an excellent tree for an anchor DCL right at the top\nof the chute. This section might be dangerous in high water. To bypass:\nclimb up the ridge DCR and rappel from a tree. Also note the crushed\nculvert located high up DCR above the chute - presumably part of the old\nroad.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Below the chute are a series of 4-5 short drops all in a row. These\ncan be rappelled or bypassed DCL. The last drop goes into a deep\npool.</li>\n<li>R6: Two-tier falls. The upper section is maybe 60ft and a shorter\nlower one. Anchored from a tree DCR. Requires just about 100ft of rope\nto get to the bottom. Would be fun to run the full flow on this one.\nThere is another short tier below which can be downclimbed.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>R7: <em>Fisher Creek Falls</em> This is a beautiful four-tiered\nwaterfall which is the highest drop on the creek and the finale. It can\nbe run in one rappel or broken up into a series of shorter ones.\nRequires about 150ft of rope from a tree anchor DCR at the top. The\nfirst tier is short (8ft) which goes into a hanging pool. It can be\ntricky to get out of in high flow. The second tier is about 50ft and\nkicks off a huge rooster-tail of water at the top. Expect to get a good\ndrubbing. The falls spreads out on tier three (20ft) and forks around a\nsmall tree island on the fourth (20ft). Unfortunately, the same tree\nlimits photographic options from the very bottom.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>R8: A short distance below the big falls, the creek drops about 15ft\nfollowed by a 30ft ramp. While it'd be fun to rappel the whole thing in\none go, several trees had fallen over the creek making the first tier\nannoying to access. We exited the creek, pushing through the bushes, to\na thin tree DCR which we used to rappel back into the creek (~35ft).\nMight be possible to downclimb here in drier conditions.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Beyond this point, there are no more technical obstacles, but the\ncreek becomes rather jungle-y / overgrown.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>From the final rappel continue downstream about 10-15min to the road.\nAlternately, exit DCR up onto the ridge when you can. Passes through\nopen forest and follow the nose down to the road. Declare victory.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<p>None.</p>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n<p>Fisher Creek was first descended in Oct 2020 by Kevin Clark, Wade\nHewitt, Lisa Ripps, and Wim Aarts.</p>\n",
