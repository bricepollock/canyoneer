  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>Raineach Canyon is a small short canyon on the south side of Loch\nTummel. It gets its water from the Faragon Ridge and a small catchment\nmeaning it is often low in flows. What it lacks in jumps and slides it\nmakes up for with an abundance of fun and often aquatic abseils. It is\nextremely well equipped, with a lot of pitches having anchors on both\nsides. This is because it is used as a training venue for canyoning\ncompanies. Because of this, it makes a great place to practice rope work\ntechniques or to set up multiple abseil lines with a large party.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<h3 id=\"getting_there\">Getting There</h3>\n<p>The canyon is located on the south side of Loch Tummel, to get here\nfrom the central belt, head north on the A9 from Dunkeld. Pass the first\nexit to Pitlochry, and then turn right off of the A9 onto a road\nsignposted for Clunie and Foss. Cross back under the A9, and follow this\nsingle-track road for 6.8 miles along the banks of first the river\nTummel and then the loch itself. This single-track road is very windy\nand is often busy with kayakers and rafters, so drive with care.</p>\n<p>Approaching from the west, make your way to Kilin. From there, take\nthe A827 along the north side of Loch Tay until you reach Fernan. Turn\nleft here. After following this small road for 5 miles, turn left at\nCoshieville to take the high road up onto the moorland. Follow this road\nuntil just after a hairpin bend then turn right down a road signposted\nfor Foss. Follow this road for 4.4 miles to arrive at the parking for\nthe canyon.</p>\n<p>You will know you are at the right spot as there is a small bridge\nand a wild camping area.</p>\n<h3 id=\"access\">Access</h3>\n<p>A small overgrown footpath leads up the RR side of the canyon. This\nleads up to near the start, offering great views into some of the\nfeatures of the canyon. The path peters out above a drop, but if you\nscramble upstream you can access one more abseil. Above this drop the\nmoorland very noticably flattens out, marking the end of the walk-in,\nand the start of the fun.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>The exit from this canyon is extremely simple. After the two\nback-to-back large abseil pitches, you can choose to exit RR via a\ncarved path or continue downstream with a final short 5m abseil. After\neither of these, climb out of the RR side of the river and walk\ndownstream for 20m to reach your vehicle. Alternatively, for a bit of\nfun, make your way under the road bridge and into the loch for a swim\nand celebratory splash about.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><img src=\"rwl_en.png\" title=\"rwl_en.png\" alt=\"rwl_en.png\" /><a\nhref=\"http://canyonguides.org/guide-book/canyon-locations-map?id=Raineach_Canyon\">UK\nCanyonGuides.org</a> : Raineach Canyon</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n<p>Catchment: 2.67km2</p>\n",
