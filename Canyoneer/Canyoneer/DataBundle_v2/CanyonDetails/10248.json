It is a spectaular slot canyon with some optional jumps, down climbs, a slide and a 30m abseil. Between 12 and 2 in spring and summer, the canyon is very crowded and you can wait up to an hour to rappel.\nYou should probably wear a wetsuit as the water is quite cold year round.\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Driving: Use GPS app of choice to drive to [<a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https:\/\/www.nationalparks.nsw.gov.au\/things-to-do\/cafes-and-kiosks\/conservation-hut\">Conservation Hut car park<\/a>]. \n<\/p><p>Walking: From the conservation hut follow the National Pass Track until you reach a T- junction at the bottom of a set of steep metal stairs, turn right taking the nature track. You will cross a bridge, this will be your first look into the canyon, continue onwards until you reach the stepping stones across Valley of the Waters Creek. The stepping stones mark the start of the canyon, there is a log book which you can fill in. There are numerous commercial operations that use this canyon, this will also help you see what traffic is ahead.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>The canyon immediately narrows, there are some tricky down climbs, short swims, some optional jumps and a 3-4m slide. The slide will take you to the top of the rappels. There are chains on both sides and clip in points for safety on the left and the right these are maintained by the park. The left hand one is typically easier as it does not go straight through the waterfall, dropping 15m to a ledge from which you can jump or 28m to a pool at the bottom. The right hand side goes down 28m to the bottom pool.\n<\/p><p><br \/>\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading3\"><h3 id=\"Topo\">Topo<\/h3><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>There is an obvious track at the bottom that leads back to the car park, it will be marked by tourists.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Red_tape\">Red tape<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Beta_sites\">Beta sites<\/h2><\/div>\n<ul><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external free\" href=\"http:\/\/ozultimate.com\/canyoning\/track_notes\/empress.htm\">http:\/\/ozultimate.com\/canyoning\/track_notes\/empress.htm<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external free\" href=\"http:\/\/www.immortaloutdoors.com\/articles\/empress_canyon\">http:\/\/www.immortaloutdoors.com\/articles\/empress_canyon<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external free\" href=\"http:\/\/www.alternatezone.com\/canyoning\/empress.htm\">http:\/\/www.alternatezone.com\/canyoning\/empress.htm<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external free\" href=\"http:\/\/www.nationalparks.nsw.gov.au\/things-to-do\/guided-tours\/abseiling-and-empress-falls-canyon\">http:\/\/www.nationalparks.nsw.gov.au\/things-to-do\/guided-tours\/abseiling-and-empress-falls-canyon<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http:\/\/descente-canyon.com\/canyoning\/canyon-description\/21370\">Descente-Canyon.com<\/a> &#160;: Empress<\/li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http:\/\/canyonmag.net\/database\/empress-canyon\">CanyonMag.net<\/a> &#160;: Empress Canyon<\/li><\/ul>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media<\/h2><\/div>\n<ul><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http:\/\/wikiloc.com\/wikiloc\/view.do?id=12825703\">Wikiloc.com<\/a> &#160;: Empress Canyon<\/li><\/ul>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Background\">Background<\/h2><\/div>\n\n\n<\/div>","version":"ed21ffd3ffb09be49666d8deda8651d7eddd460a4cf22bebb39f521c14d0632f","geojson":{"features":[{"type":"Feature","properties":{"name":"Start"},"geometry":{"coordinates":[[150.35788,-33.7183,0]],"type":"Point"}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[[150.359116,-33.720654,0]]},"properties":{"name":"End"}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"coordinates":[[150.363083,-33.719997,0]],"type":"Point"},"properties":{"name":"Parking"}}],"type":"FeatureCollection"},"quality":3,"waterRating":"B"}
