There was a long thin log sticking up the final waterfall. Nick attached a prussik sling to the log and climbed up - and then put a rope down for us. We then climbed up to the northern cliffline and soon found a steep, scrambling pass up that and back out along the ridge.<\/i>\"\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Red_tape\">Red tape<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Beta_sites\">Beta sites<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Background\">Background<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>David Noble says: named after an early attempt to visit the creek (9 Jan 76). Tom Williams (Springwood Bushwalking Club) exclaimed when he was being picked up on the Friday night of the trip that he knew of a creek that was a \"surefire canyon\". The party (Dave Noble, Ian Hickson, Ross Bradstock, C Cosgrove (SUBW) and Tom Williams) were unable to do the canyon then because of heavy rain and the effects of several flagons of Royal Reserve port. \n<\/p><p>Dave Noble did a solo reconnaissance of the creek on 29 Feb 76 and confirmed the presence of canyon. Tom Williams, Dave Noble together with Tony Haigh (KBC) and Ted Daniels (NPA) finally did the trip down the canyon on 23 October 1976. (Kameruka Magazine Vol 15 No 1 - Sept 77). Ted Daniels recorded the descent on Standard 8 cine film. Later on the same afternoon there was a rare (partial) solar eclipse. \n<\/p><p>Photos of the first descent can be found here: <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external free\" href=\"https:\/\/www.david-noble.net\/canyoning\/wolgan\/wolgancanyons.html\">https:\/\/www.david-noble.net\/canyoning\/wolgan\/wolgancanyons.html<\/a>\n<\/p>\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nParsed by mw‐api‐ext.codfw.main‐6779cc57fc‐w5mmv\nCached time: 20240914192034\nCache expiry: 2592000\nReduced expiry: false\nComplications: [show‐toc]\nCPU time usage: 0.005 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.006 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 21\/1000000\nPost‐expand include size: 0\/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 0\/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 2\/100\nExpensive parser function count: 0\/500\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0\/20\nUnstrip post‐expand size: 0\/5000000 bytes\nNumber of Wikibase entities loaded: 0\/400\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%    0.000      1 -total\n-->\n<\/div>","months":["Oct","Nov","Dec","Jan","Feb","Mar","Apr"],"quality":0,"url":"https:\/\/ropewiki.com\/Surefire","geojson":null,"rappelCountMax":null,"id":77685,"vehicle":null,"version":"8988d9c0b45c86673a6abcc4f23163643eac5aba926cca56c96d4f5f4e1d0a2f","shuttleSeconds":null,"timeRating":null,"longitude":150.2919,"name":"Surefire","permit":"No","rappelCountMin":null,"rappelLongestMeters":null}
