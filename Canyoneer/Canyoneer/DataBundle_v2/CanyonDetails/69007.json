The canyon should be dry in all but recent rain, but due to the fact the river must be forded this canyon gets a class \"B\" rating as canyoneers will at least get wet twice.\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Standard Approach: Walk upstream along the road until a gully on the north side appears. At this point ford the river and hike up the gully. Hike up until a seam canyon appears on the left and take the to the wash on the other side.\n<\/p><p>Challenging Approach: Since the canyon is so short and easy an option exists to make it more challenging.  By hiking up the exit to a dry fall, a narrow side canyon on the north can be up climbed.  This is not for beginners and even some intermediates might feel uncomfortable here as it is loses, sandy, and brushy.  If you have the skills, though, it will make this little canyon more rewarding.  Once at the top of the slot you can pop over the ridge and descend down a wash that will rejoin the main canyon.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>There are only two rappels off natural anchors--and the first one can be down climbed.  The anchor for the final rap can be off a deadman or cairn set about 10 feet form the edge or a tree which would be set way back with a lot of webbing.  This is also a good place to practice using a sandtrap.  The rap is about 85 feet.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>After the final rappel there is a somewhat wide area at the top of a dry fall.  On the north side of the canyon (LDC) a narrow side canyon intersects the main canyon.  This side canyon provides a small down climb, however, beginners might feel it is a bit challenging or exposed.  With assistance and spotting it shouldn't be a problem.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Red_Tape\">Red Tape<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading3\"><h3 id=\"Permits\">Permits<\/h3><\/div>\n<p>A permit is required for any and all canyoneering within the boundaries of Capitol Reef National Park.
