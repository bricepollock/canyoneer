  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>This is a very short canyon that is a nice one to do if you happen to\nfinish your primary canyon(s) early and have a little extra time to\nfill; or, if you have a few beginners and that want an easy introduction\nto canyoneering. The canyon should be dry in all but recent rain, but\ndue to the fact the river must be forded this canyon gets a class \"B\"\nrating as canyoneers will at least get wet twice.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>Standard Approach: Walk upstream along the road until a gully on the\nnorth side appears. At this point ford the river and hike up the gully.\nHike up until a seam canyon appears on the left and take the to the wash\non the other side.</p>\n<p>Challenging Approach: Since the canyon is so short and easy an option\nexists to make it more challenging. By hiking up the exit to a dry fall,\na narrow side canyon on the north can be up climbed. This is not for\nbeginners and even some intermediates might feel uncomfortable here as\nit is loses, sandy, and brushy. If you have the skills, though, it will\nmake this little canyon more rewarding. Once at the top of the slot you\ncan pop over the ridge and descend down a wash that will rejoin the main\ncanyon.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>There are only two rappels off natural anchors--and the first one can\nbe down climbed. The anchor for the final rap can be off a deadman or\ncairn set about 10 feet form the edge or a tree which would be set way\nback with a lot of webbing. This is also a good place to practice using\na sandtrap. The rap is about 85 feet.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>After the final rappel there is a somewhat wide area at the top of a\ndry fall. On the north side of the canyon (LDC) a narrow side canyon\nintersects the main canyon. This side canyon provides a small down\nclimb, however, beginners might feel it is a bit challenging or exposed.\nWith assistance and spotting it shouldn't be a problem.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red Tape</h2>\n<h3 id=\"permits\">Permits</h3>\n<p>A permit is required for any and all canyoneering within the\nboundaries of Capitol Reef National Park. Permits have a group-size\nlimit that varies depending on the canyon or route. A separate permit is\nrequired for each canyoneering route. Currently, there is no quota limit\nnor permit cost, though that is likely to change at some point in the\nfuture. Permits can be obtained onsite through a self-serve kiosk\nlocated just outside of the visitor center or by sending and email to\ncare_permits@nps.gov using the following format:</p>\n<p><strong>Subject:</strong> Name of canyoneering route and date you\nwill be canyoneering.</p>\n<p><strong>Email Body:</strong> Date of visit (single day only):\nCanyoneering route (single route only): Number of people: Vehicle\nlocation: Number of motorized vehicles: Vehicle description(s):</p>\n<p>If you plan to camp overnight as part of a canyoneering trip, you are\nrequired to obtain a free backcountry permit, available at the visitor\ncenter.</p>\n<h3 id=\"additional_access_information\">Additional Access\nInformation:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>CRNP canyoneering permit information webpage: <a\nhref=\"https://www.nps.gov/care/planyourvisit/canyoneering.htm\">https://www.nps.gov/care/planyourvisit/canyoneering.htm</a></li>\n<li>Other: <a\nhref=\"http://www.americancanyoneers.org/access-capitol-reef/\">http://www.americancanyoneers.org/access-capitol-reef/</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"group_size_limit\">Group-Size Limit:</h3>\n<p>Canyoneering groups are limited to a maximum of 12 people for this\nCanyon.</p>\n<p>Groups larger than 8 or 12 sharing the same affiliation (school,\nchurch, club, scout group, family, friends, etc., or combination\nthereof) may divide into groups smaller than 8 or 12, provided they do\nnot occupy the same canyon, drainage, general area or the same route on\nthe same day.</p>\n<h3 id=\"park_entrance_fee\">Park Entrance Fee:</h3>\n<p>The Scenic drive is the only area of Capitol Reef where an entry fee\nor park pass is required. Passes can be attained at the visitor center\nor at a self-pay kiosk at the start of the scenic drive. Fees are good\nfor seven days and can be found here: <a\nhref=\"http://www.nps.gov/care/planyourvisit/fees.htm\">http://www.nps.gov/care/planyourvisit/fees.htm</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><img src=\"rwl_en.png\" title=\"rwl_en.png\" alt=\"rwl_en.png\" /><a\nhref=\"https://www.roadtripryan.com/go/t/utah/capitol-reef/beaver-bay-canyon\">RoadTripRyan.com</a>\n: Beaver Bay Canyon</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape_1\">Red tape</h2>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites_1\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media_1\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background_1\">Background</h2>\n",
