  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>A beautiful ladder of crystal waterfalls dropping one after the other\nin the Andes Mountains close to the town of Jardin, a 3 hour drive from\nMedellin. If waterfall rappelling, in the flow, is your jam then this\none is for you. No slides or jumps, but minimal creek walking, a couple\ndownclimbs and nearly all of the dozen or more waterfalls are rigged for\ngetting in the flow. Rock is surprisingly grippy. Many other canyoning\nroutes are nearby Jardin, making this a great destination for a week of\ncanyons and other nature activities.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<p>The approach requires crossing private property and permission must\nbe obtained from the owner. Aventura de Jardin, a guide company has\npermission and may grant a good deal to canyoneers who bring their own\ngear and especially to those who gift needed gear like s.s. Maillions,\n25kN carabiners, 9mm rope, etc.</p>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n",
