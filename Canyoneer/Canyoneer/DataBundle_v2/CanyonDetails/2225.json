  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>A classic Columbia Gorge canyon with a minimal approach and return.\nSadly, there are a number of dumped cars in the creek (reportedly 13 at\none count); likely attempts at insurance fraud. Be ready for some jungle\nbushwhacking and creek walking at the beginning before reaching R1. Note\nthat this canyon holds a good amount of water late into the season.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Beware poison oak on the approach and exit.</li>\n<li>Watershed: 5.8mi^2. Checkpoint is from the bridge on the Old\nColumbia River Highway where it crosses the creek.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Red Tape Updates 2023:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Please review the Exit section below for information on property\nissues on the hike out.</li>\n<li>The West Columbia Gorge lead, David Spangler, has requested\ncanyoneers please do not run the lower falls (R5 &amp; R6) on Bridal\nVeil Creek due to public safety concerns.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>Drop a car at the exit: the parking lot for the official Bridal Veil\nFalls off the Old Columbia River Hwy.</p>\n<p>Either walk or shuttle 0.5mi east on the old highway east. (If on\nfoot, use caution as there is no shoulder in some area and vehicles come\nbarreling through here. It might be possible to bushwhack up to the\nPalmer Mill road direct and shave off some distance, but this has not\nbeen explored.) Just before the Angel's Rest trailhead, turn off right\non Palmer Mill Rd and right again immediately. Palmer Mill is one lane,\nsteep, and eroded in spots, but can be driven carefully by 2WD as of\n2020. Follow it up for 1.5mi up to a spot where the road take a\n90-degree left turn. There's room here for a copule cars at a pullout.\nThere are two options for entering the creek:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Shortcut Approach: Backtrack 0.25mi down Palmer Mill the way you\ncame to a gully. Take the gully down to the creek on an emerging use\ntrail. Drop-in takes you in just before the first rappel. You will miss\nsome nice bedrock going this way, however.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Classic Approach: From the pullout, bushwhack down the nose of the\nridge directly into the creek. It's steep and scrambly in spots, and\nbecomes a jungle near the bottom, but doable. There is a lengthy stretch\nof annoying creek-walking before you reach the bedrock.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>In high water, the descent can be quite technical. Several drops may\nhave hydraulics present at the bottom. Experienced swiftwater canyoneers\nwill have a blast rappeling in the watercourse and negotiating these\nproblems, while beginners may prefer to bypass them by rappelling out of\nthe watercourse.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A short drop (easily downclimbed) with three dumped cars marks the\nbeginning of the technical section.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>R1: <em>Upper Bridal Veil Falls</em> 100ft dry rappel from tree DCL.\nAn anchor DCR might help keep you in the flow. It is possible to escape\nbelow R1 on a steep user-trail up to the road.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The bedrock below R1 is a delight and a highlight of the canyon.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>R2: 15ft from single bolt DCL. Or, downclimb half way and jump DCL\ninto a pool with a 5ft deep hole. Beware rocks in the center of the\npool. Scout it first!</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>R3: 25ft from tree DCL. Rappel off the side of the tree towards the\nfalls, but throw the pull side off the back (downstream) for an easy\nretrieval.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>R4: <em>Middle Bridal Veil Falls</em>: 90ft from a boulder DCR\n(anchor may be underwater in high flow) or tree DCL (dry rappel). Use\ncaution when deploying ropes as there are two large metal cables\nleftover from the logging days hanging down the DCL side of the falls.\nDeep pool at the bottom.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>Historically, canyoneers would use an overgrown use trail on the DCL\n/ west side of the creek. It starts just under a fallen log below R4 and\nleads all the way to bridge, never straying far from the creek. Takes\nabout 15min. Be aware, however, everything west of the creek is private\nland and the local owner is not friendly to canyoneers (waterfall\nphotographers okay). To avoid potential issues, it may be better to stay\nin the creek (i.e. right on the property line) or bushwhack along the\neast side (State Park land). Another option, while unpleasant, might be\nto exit up to the Palmer Mill Road after R4. Be aware: Middle Bridal\nVeil Falls is not on state park land; it is clearly inside Mt. Hood\nNational Forest.</p>\n<p>Exit the creek upon reaching the bridge.</p>\n<h3 id=\"bridal_veil_falls\">Bridal Veil Falls</h3>\n<p><strong>Running R5 &amp; R6 is not recommended; please see \"Red Tape\"\nbelow.</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>R5 &amp; R6: <em>Bridal Veil Falls</em>, a two-tier waterfall and\nmajor tourist attraction. As of 9/20/23, the land manager, David\nSpangler has asked that we DO NOT run this section for public safety\nconcerns. This is a reasonable ask. R5: Huge Tree back DCR, 120’. R6:\nSunken railroad tie and metal spike mid stream, 50’. Both falls have\ndeep pools at the bottom with potential hydraulics in high flow. You\nwill likely have a crowd watching you from the viewing platform. Follow\nthe trail back to the parking area.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Please avoid private land on the west side of the creek below\nR4.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Bridal Veil Falls (R5 &amp; R6) is one of a number of popular\nwaterfalls located along the Historic Columbia River Highway.\nIndividuals climbing, rappelling, or slack-lining around such \"show\nwaterfalls\" are far more likely to garner negative reactions from the\ngeneral public at large. Negative reactions can lead to complaints and\nmore canyon rules/regulations by the local authorities. As of September\n2023, Columbia River Gorge West lead, David Spangler, has requested that\ncanyoneers please refrain from running the last two falls on the creek.\nLet's please respect the request in the interests of maintaining good\nrelations with local land managers.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><img src=\"rwl_en.png\" title=\"rwl_en.png\" alt=\"rwl_en.png\" /><a\nhref=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20210527212206/www.canyoneeringnorthwest.com/BridalVeil/Bridal_Veil_Creek.php\">CanyoneeringNorthwest.com\n(archive.org)</a> : Bridal Veil Creek</li>\n<li><img src=\"rwl_en.png\" title=\"rwl_en.png\" alt=\"rwl_en.png\" /><a\nhref=\"http://ropewiki.com/User:Super_Amazing_Map?id=Bridal_Veil_Creek_-_Oregon\">Super\nAmazing Map</a> : Bridal Veil Creek</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<p>{{#ev:youtube|v=rpRktTY8x7U}}</p>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n\n<h2 id=\"bride_of_hercules_falls\">Bride of Hercules Falls</h2>\n<p>This is an 80ft falls located on a small seasonal creek immediately\nwest of the Bridal Veil Falls parking area. This creek likely only runs\nduring the winter months and is just a short fun objective if you're\nlooking to get your quick \"rappel fix\" in the off-season. No real\ndifficulties. Nice &amp; splashy. From the parking area, walk northwest\ndown the paved trail. Just before the first viewpoint, veer off west and\ndrop down to the creek. Requires a little bushwhacking, but not that\nbad. Anchor is a large tree DCL atop the falls. At the bottom, follow\nwestward along the base of the cliffs until you can find a way to\nscramble back up to the top. Takes 20-30min tops. Beware poison oak and\nblackberry in the area -- another good reason to visit only in the\nwinter.</p>\n<p>The falls gets its name from the spires to the west, a rock climbing\ndestination, known as <em>The Pillars of Hercules</em>.</p>\n",
