The approach to this canyon has now been completed and there is flagging showing the path to take up to the top of the big drop. This is at approximately 500m elevation. KML file for the path to take will be added.\n<\/p><p>Here is a link to a photo album of the most recent scouting trip. <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https:\/\/photos.app.goo.gl\/Bun4ojZjmto9GQss7\">Scouting Sept 2020<\/a>\n<\/p><p>The canyon has now been partially descended by Artem Bylinskii, Nick Hindley, and Michael Henson (August 13th 2022). Mostly natural anchors were used. Water level was high and problematic at some locations.\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https:\/\/photos.app.goo.gl\/pK16LbPrVf9v84998\">First Partial Descent<\/a>\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Put in under the bridge which crosses the Squamish river at the Ashlu River campground.\nFloat down the river until you pass Madden Falls and then as you go around the corner you will see where Mawby Creek joins the Squamish. This year there was a nice little beach there and a decent eddy.\nLots of animals in this area. We saw fresh wolf and grizzly foot prints on the sand. Plan for a grizzly to gnaw on your water craft and be prepared for that outcome.\nMake your way into the forest about 30m to the north of Mawby Creek. From here hike up the hill parallel to Mawby Creek following animal trails. As the hill gets steeper you will see flagging which takes you up the best route to the 500m elevation required to start this canyon.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Red_tape\">Red tape<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Beta_sites\">Beta sites<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Background\">Background<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media<\/h2><\/div>\n<style data-mw-deduplicate=\"TemplateStyles:r1062633282\">@media all and (max-width:720px){.mw-parser-output .content .thumb>div:not(.thumbinner){display:flex;justify-content:center;flex-wrap:wrap;align-content:flex-start;flex-direction:column}}body.skin-vector .mw-parser-output div.thumb>div:not(.thumbinner){font-size:94%;text-align:center;overflow:hidden;min-width:100px}body.skin-minerva .mw-parser-output div.thumb>div:not(.thumbinner){margin:0 auto;max-width:100%!important}<\/style> \n<div class=\"thumb tright\">\n<div style=\"display:table;\">\n<span class=\"mw-default-size\" typeof=\"mw:Error mw:File\/Frameless\">\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Trip_Reports\">Trip Reports<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>August 14th 2022\nArtem Bylinskii, Nick Hindley, Michael Henson descended the top ~250m of vertical using mostly natural anchors.
