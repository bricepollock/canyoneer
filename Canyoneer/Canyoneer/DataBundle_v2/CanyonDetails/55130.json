  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>Located in the community of Zoquitipa not far from Tamazunchale.\nThere is nice camping available as well as cabins on the playita “El\nSaucito”.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>From the community of Zoquitipa walk downstream until you reach the\nboat crossing to the other community (the name was something that\nreminds me of chocolate...). Instead of taking the boats across, there\nis a trail that heads up the mountain past a cave entrance. We took this\ntrail up onto the mountain and dropped into the drainage this way.</p>\n<p>It is probably easier to simply get out of the colectivo at the top\nof the drainage and walk down.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>We did 3 or 4 pitches, some of them could be downclimbed if you were\ncomfortable. We only used natural anchors. Trees where abundant, though\nsome required some scrambling to reach. We used CEMs. My 60m was\nsufficient for all the drops. Nothing close to 30m, but anchors are\nquite far back for some of the pitches.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>The canyon ends just before río Amajac. There is a nice grassy area\nbelow a sheer cliff. Follow the stream back towards Zoquitipa, there you\ncan catch a colectivo.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<p><a\nhref=\"https://www.zunoticia.com/zoquitipa-ofrece-turismo-de-naturaleza/\">https://www.zunoticia.com/zoquitipa-ofrece-turismo-de-naturaleza/</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n<p>I visited David with my canyoning gear, he told me about the canyon,\nand we decided to descend it with another local who had never\nabseiled.</p>\n",
