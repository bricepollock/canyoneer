Potshots may be\nnecessary for one or two pothole escapes. Under most conditions partner\nassist and creativity is sufficient for pothole escapes. Not for\nbeginners.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>If doing the direct approach from the highway to the head of the\ncanyon, it is only approximately 4 miles and would allow for the canyon\nto be done in one long day.
