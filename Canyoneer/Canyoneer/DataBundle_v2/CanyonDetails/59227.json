St. Helens. It features several multipitch rappels up to 275 feet. Typically moderate to low flow, this route is best run in the spring while there is still snow melting on top of Strawberry Mountain. The route dries up during the mid to late summer and could still be run as a dry canyon but likely wouldn’t be as much fun. A 300 foot rope is needed to run this canyon.\n<\/p><p><b>How To Get There<\/b>\n<\/p><p>From I-5, take Hwy 12 to Randle. Head south on WA-131 S for 2.7 mi. Keep right on NFD 25 and continue for 5.9mi. Make a slight right on FR 26 and continue for 9.5mi. Park at the turnout where FR 26 crosses the creek (46.3739, -122.0554).\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>From the parking area, begin hiking up the road, checking out the falls as you go by. After about 400’, cut into the forest and immediately begin the climb up the hillside. While fairly steep, the terrain and undergrowth are not too difficult to navigate. Slowly traverse your way towards the canyon as you ascend. There is a steep gully that parallels the canyon. Continue up until the gully fades out and it is easier to cross. Drop in to the canyon at around 3,200’ above the first big drop(46.3735, -122.0516) and enjoy the beautiful views across the Quartz Creek valley.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>DCL = Down Canyon Left\n<\/p><p>DCR = Down Canyon Right\n<\/p><p><i>This canyon features unlinked bolt anchors. <b>Please do not link these anchors with webbing!<\/b> The anchors are exposed to high water flow and debris during the off season, which can catch on linked anchors and severely damage them.
