  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>Strawberry Mountain Falls is a very scenic open-faced route in the\nGifford Pinchot National Forest north of Mt. St. Helens. It features\nseveral multipitch rappels up to 275 feet. Typically moderate to low\nflow, this route is best run in the spring while there is still snow\nmelting on top of Strawberry Mountain. The route dries up during the mid\nto late summer and could still be run as a dry canyon but likely\nwouldn’t be as much fun. A 300 foot rope is needed to run this\ncanyon.</p>\n<p><strong>How To Get There</strong></p>\n<p>From I-5, take Hwy 12 to Randle. Head south on WA-131 S for 2.7 mi.\nKeep right on NFD 25 and continue for 5.9mi. Make a slight right on FR\n26 and continue for 9.5mi. Park at the turnout where FR 26 crosses the\ncreek (46.3739, -122.0554).</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>From the parking area, begin hiking up the road, checking out the\nfalls as you go by. After about 400’, cut into the forest and\nimmediately begin the climb up the hillside. While fairly steep, the\nterrain and undergrowth are not too difficult to navigate. Slowly\ntraverse your way towards the canyon as you ascend. There is a steep\ngully that parallels the canyon. Continue up until the gully fades out\nand it is easier to cross. Drop in to the canyon at around 3,200’ above\nthe first big drop(46.3735, -122.0516) and enjoy the beautiful views\nacross the Quartz Creek valley.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>DCL = Down Canyon Left</p>\n<p>DCR = Down Canyon Right</p>\n<p><em>This canyon features unlinked bolt anchors. <strong>Please do not\nlink these anchors with webbing!</strong> The anchors are exposed to\nhigh water flow and debris during the off season, which can catch on\nlinked anchors and severely damage them. Groups should be familiar with\nhow to safely rig unlinked bolts.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Multipitch Rappel #1</strong></p>\n<p>- R1: 100’ from a tree DCL to a double bolt anchor DCR. Bolts are on\na slab of rock directly next to the watercourse.</p>\n<p>- R2: The Grand Staircase: 190’</p>\n<p><strong>Multipitch Rappel #2</strong></p>\n<p>- R3: 190’ from a tree center canyon to a double bolt anchor DCR.\nBolts are on a slab of rock directly next to the watercourse where the\nfalls begins to open up again.</p>\n<p>- R4: 175’ from a bolt station DCR just at the lip. Rappel down the\nslabby rock 175’ to a bolt station.</p>\n<p>- R5: 100’ from a bolt station DCR. This rappel is vertical. Manage\nabrasion appropriately as the rock on this lip is sharp in places.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<p>Photos from the first descent on May 9th, 2020: <a\nhref=\"https://www.facebook.com/media/set?set=a.2711029335690219&amp;type=3\">https://www.facebook.com/media/set?set=a.2711029335690219&amp;type=3</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n<p>This canyon was first descended on 5/9/2020 by Ryan Ernst,\nHaruka-James Clay Lipscomb, Barry Specht, and Jake Huddleston.</p>\n",
