class=\"mw-content-ltr mw-parser-output\" lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><p>This is a classic. The lower section of this canyon provides a sequence of waterfall rappels through a narrow granite hallway including short free-hangs with water pouring down around you, that with a good flow are some of the best in Southern California. There are a number of rappels that have awkward starts and potentially challenging natural anchors, hence this is not a beginner canyon. The approach is steep and loose and offers another potential hazard. Please note that although it is possible to descend the full canyon, only the Lower section is really worth doing. The Upper section is not interesting and the Middle section adds a couple waterfalls to the descent but it does not have an easy access. \n<\/p><p>Monkeyface Creek is spring fed and therefore is likely to have at the very least a small flow year round. However, to catch it with good flow look to the winter and spring season. Caution should be taken however after large rainfall. The lower section is quite narrow and could be extremely hazardous and potentially deadly at high flow. From the short-cut drop-in point on the ridge at 34.09976, -116.95299 you can see the 2 smaller upper waterfalls by looking up canyon. Compare them to the picture. With twice this flow it could be fun. With significantly more flow it could be quite dangerous. The canyon doesn't really narrow up until after the first couple rappels. At that point, the high-water escape route is the only option to leave the canyon.\n<\/p><p>Some of the waterfalls are partially visible by a signpost on the road, this makes for a good checkpoint to inspect before starting the approach. Another checkpoint is in the vicinity of the drop-in point where a couple waterfalls in the Middle section are clearly visible.\n<style data-mw-deduplicate=\"TemplateStyles:r1062633282\">@media all and (max-width:720px){.mw-parser-output .content .thumb>div:not(.thumbinner){display:flex;justify-content:center;flex-wrap:wrap;align-content:flex-start;flex-direction:column}}body.skin-vector .mw-parser-output div.thumb>div:not(.thumbinner){font-size:94%;text-align:center;overflow:hidden;min-width:100px}body.skin-minerva .mw-parser-output div.thumb>div:not(.thumbinner){margin:0 auto;max-width:100%!important}<\/style> \n<\/p>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\">\n<div style=\"display:table;\">\n<div class=\"thumbcaption\" style=\"display:table-caption;caption-side:bottom;box-sizing:border-box;\">{{{caption}}} <\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>Rappel 5 is probably the most dangerous rappel in high flow, and hence the best reference to compare waterflow. This rappel has a large chockstone at the top of the rappel and graffiti on trees at the bottom.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>This is where you earn it. The approach is steep and sustained. You have 2 choices, the gully climb or the ridge climb (see pictures below).  Either way rock fall can pose a serious threat.  Gloves and helmets should be worn and spacing out is wise, but be aware that any rock knocked loose can gain more and more speed the farther it goes down. For larger groups the ridge is much safer as it gives room to spread out laterally.\n<\/p><p>Gully climb approach: Head up a rocky boulder field that turns into a shallow but obvious gully. There is some scrambling mixed with steep loose slopes. About 2\/3 of the way up, it turns into a dirt trough that can be a pain to climb. After about 1,000 feet of gain you reach a big dead burn out tree and just above that a flat rocky area.  Up and slightly right (North) is a small saddle which is the historic gully drop-in.  Up left (West) is the new earthen slope drop-in. \n<\/p><p>Ridge climb approach: Head up the same way, but cut left above the first scramble \"headwall\", just before the 2nd one.  There are fairly prominent footsteps and switchbacks that wander up the steep slope.  About 800 feet up you reach the knife edge ridge (34.09896, -116.95413) and you can see R2, R3 and R4 from this high vantage point.  Continue climbing up the steep ridge 200 feet up, until it flattens out (34.09933, -116.95359) and head toward a large burnt out pine tree on a less steep slope left.  There is a good use trail that starts here and continues all the way to the canyon floor.\n<\/p><p>Below are pictures of the recommended approaches. \n<link rel=\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\" href=\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1062633282\"> \n<\/p>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\">\n<div style=\"display:table;\">\n<span class=\"mw-default-size\" typeof=\"mw:Error mw:File\/Frameless\">\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<link rel=\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\" href=\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1062633282\"> \n<div class=\"thumb tright\">\n<div style=\"display:table;\">\n<span class=\"mw-default-size\" typeof=\"mw:Error mw:File\/Frameless\">\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p><b>Historic Gully Entry<\/b>: Prior hand-line \/ downclimb gully (from the saddle) is now a total mess of toppled large trees and large amounts of loose scree and talus (as a result of July 2018 Valley Fire).

It is recommended that the last person should stop at the chock-stone, anchor into the R8 bolts with rings RDC head level, pull the rope, thread through the rings and rappel R8 separately from R7. If you don't use the R8 anchor, then there is a significant chance your rope will get stuck behind this chock-stone when you pull it from the bottom of R8.  Many ropes have been stuck here!  However, since 2023 winter the floor seems to be less prone to getting ropes stuck.\n<\/p><p><b>R9<\/b>: 78 feet anchored from bolts with chains RDC; there is a short down-climb to access these bolt.

If a canyoneer decides to use it, ample webbing and rapides should be taken to reinforce or build new natural anchors. The rope lengths normally taken to descend the canyon should be sufficient for the bypass. The bypass route was intact in June 2021. All rope lengths are close approximations. Use safe techniques with an end knot in the rope while descending the bypass. The goal of this route is to gain access to a large broken rampway hovering over the flowing water. The ramp is on canyon right. In this way, the very narrow portion of the canyon can be avoided if it has too much water to be safely descended. There are two entry points to this rampway. The numbering of rappels used for this discussion for the main canyon came from the ropewiki description of July, 2017.\n<\/p><p>First entry point is half way between main canyon rappels 4 and 5. There is an obvious side canyon coming in from the west (canyon right, aka RDC). Climb up about 70 vertical feet above the water to a large oak tree. Take the narrow rampway below the rock face, down canyon to the right. You may choose to use a natural anchor on a small tree to create a roped, protected traverse about 54 feet long.\n<\/p><p>Second entry point is found between main canyon rappels 6 and 7. Climb up an easy class five route on canyon right for about 18 feet. Just out of view of the watercourse is a double bolt anchor. It allows you to traverse 45 feet over to bypass anchor #5. This is a nearly horizontal traverse with fall exposure. The first\/upper entry point may be easier.\n<\/p><p><b>Bypass rappel #1:<\/b>  a double bolt station, length 47 feet, continue down through brush, small trees and cactus.\n<\/p><p><b>Bypass rappel #2:<\/b>  a natural anchor from one of many large bushes, length 82 feet, continue down and to the right.\n<\/p><p><b>Bypass rappel #3:<\/b> a double bolt station, length 70 feet.\n<\/p><p><b>Bypass rappel #4:<\/b> a natural anchor, length 51 feet.\n<\/p><p><b>Bypass rappel #5:<\/b>  a double bolt station, length 75 feet, continue generally down the fall line toward thick tall \ntrees below.\n<\/p><p><b>Bypass rappel #6:<\/b>  a double bolt station, length 58 feet, easily accessible with a small platform at the anchor. \n<\/p><p><b>Bypass rappel #7:<\/b>  a double bolt station, length 53 feet, located on a face with a tiny ledge to stand on.
