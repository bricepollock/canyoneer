  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>This is a classic. The lower section of this canyon provides a\nsequence of waterfall rappels through a narrow granite hallway including\nshort free-hangs with water pouring down around you, that with a good\nflow are some of the best in Southern California. There are a number of\nrappels that have awkward starts and potentially challenging natural\nanchors, hence this is not a beginner canyon. The approach is steep and\nloose and offers another potential hazard. Please note that although it\nis possible to descend the full canyon, only the Lower section is really\nworth doing. The Upper section is not interesting and the Middle section\nadds a couple waterfalls to the descent but it does not have an easy\naccess.</p>\n<p>Monkeyface Creek is spring fed and therefore is likely to have at the\nvery least a small flow year round. However, to catch it with good flow\nlook to the winter and spring season. Caution should be taken however\nafter large rainfall. The lower section is quite narrow and could be\nextremely hazardous and potentially deadly at high flow. From the\nshort-cut drop-in point on the ridge at 34.09976, -116.95299 you can see\nthe 2 smaller upper waterfalls by looking up canyon. Compare them to the\npicture. With twice this flow it could be fun. With significantly more\nflow it could be quite dangerous. The canyon doesn't really narrow up\nuntil after the first couple rappels. At that point, the high-water\nescape route is the only option to leave the canyon.</p>\n<p>Some of the waterfalls are partially visible by a signpost on the\nroad, this makes for a good checkpoint to inspect before starting the\napproach. Another checkpoint is in the vicinity of the drop-in point\nwhere a couple waterfalls in the Middle section are clearly visible.\n</p>\n<p>Rappel 5 is probably the most dangerous rappel in high flow, and\nhence the best reference to compare waterflow. This rappel has a large\nchockstone at the top of the rappel and graffiti on trees at the\nbottom.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>This is where you earn it. The approach is steep and sustained. You\nhave 2 choices, the gully climb or the ridge climb (see pictures below).\nEither way rock fall can pose a serious threat. Gloves and helmets\nshould be worn and spacing out is wise, but be aware that any rock\nknocked loose can gain more and more speed the farther it goes down. For\nlarger groups the ridge is much safer as it gives room to spread out\nlaterally.</p>\n<p>Gully climb approach: Head up a rocky boulder field that turns into a\nshallow but obvious gully. There is some scrambling mixed with steep\nloose slopes. About 2/3 of the way up, it turns into a dirt trough that\ncan be a pain to climb. After about 1,000 feet of gain you reach a big\ndead burn out tree and just above that a flat rocky area. Up and\nslightly right (North) is a small saddle which is the historic gully\ndrop-in. Up left (West) is the new earthen slope drop-in.</p>\n<p>Ridge climb approach: Head up the same way, but cut left above the\nfirst scramble \"headwall\", just before the 2nd one. There are fairly\nprominent footsteps and switchbacks that wander up the steep slope.\nAbout 800 feet up you reach the knife edge ridge (34.09896, -116.95413)\nand you can see R2, R3 and R4 from this high vantage point. Continue\nclimbing up the steep ridge 200 feet up, until it flattens out\n(34.09933, -116.95359) and head toward a large burnt out pine tree on a\nless steep slope left. There is a good use trail that starts here and\ncontinues all the way to the canyon floor.</p>\n<p>Below are pictures of the recommended approaches. </p>\n<p><strong>Historic Gully Entry</strong>: Prior hand-line / downclimb\ngully (from the saddle) is now a total mess of toppled large trees and\nlarge amounts of loose scree and talus (as a result of July 2018 Valley\nFire). This way into the canyon is now much more hazardous than before\nthe fire. Take the earthen slope entry instead.</p>\n<p><strong>Earthen Slope Entry</strong>: Before the historic gully\nsaddle (hike West a couple hundred feet back along the ridgeline), hike\ndown the earthen slope from the ridge to the creek bed following a use\ntrail. This way down requires no handline or scrambling, just walk down\nthe steep dirt. It is a safer and easier entry than the gully, although\nit can be tricky with snow cover.</p>\n<p>Once at the creek you can hike upstream a ways if you'd like to check\nout the first of the upper two falls. Hike downstream past a huge logjam\nto R2. Dawn the wetsuits (except for the hottest of days late in the\nseason when the water is not so frigid). A rain shell is highly\nrecommended even in summer and full wetsuit in winter and spring.</p>\n<p>NOTE: It is possible to climb an additional 2,500' gain on the same\ntype of terrain (maybe worse) to access the Upper and Middle sections of\nthe canyon, but this only adds the 2 short rappels which you can see\nfrom the drop-in ridge. If you want to do the upper 2 waterfalls, follow\nthe beta described in R1 (descent section below).</p>\n<p>The Descent beta describes the Lower section of canyon, which\nprovides the most bang for your buck.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p><strong>R1</strong>: Either sneak route bypasses this rappel\nsequence. To access this upper waterfall pair, climb up a steep (but not\nexposed) gully directly across from the earthen slope drop-in, head\nright into a sub gully, top out a small ridge, traverse across to\nanother ridge with 2 large tree in a gully leading down to the falls.\nRappel 60 feet off each tree (IE 2x 60') down to the top of the upper\nfalls. Rappel the upper falls off a tree or large tree root DCL. Use\nlog(s) and or rocks for an anchor to rappel the low angle lower falls.\nHike a few minutes down canyon and you are back to the earthen slope\ndrop-in.</p>\n<p><strong>R2</strong>: 80+ feet anchored from a tree RDC on the rappel\nslab at top; webbing is hidden from view. Historically 90+ feet anchored\nfrom huge tree with top busted off and various half live branches. Both\nof these anchor keep you out of the water course most of the way\ndown.</p>\n<p><strong>R3</strong>: 43 feet anchored from a mostly dead tree RDC;\nnice rappel over a huge boulder into the water, and overhanging the last\nbit. As of JAN2022 all the logs are cleared out, so you can continue\nthrough R4 rather than rig a separate rappel. As of JUN2022 some large\nsticks and small logs are present; check your pull for snagging!</p>\n<p><strong>R4</strong>: 50 feet anchored from a boulder RDC about 35\nfeet back from the drop, near the bottom of the R3 waterfall. The drop\nitself is short now as the pool at the bottom is clogged with logs.</p>\n<p>There is a short hike past an overhanging wall (left side) with some\nsport climbs and a bend to the left where you will be able to see Forest\nFalls Road far below. The canyon starts to narrow up here and drops more\nsignificantly through a granite hallway with rappels one right after\nanother starting with:</p>\n<p><strong>R5</strong>: 48 feet anchored from large tree. Descends over\na giant boulder, then overhanging next to falling water.</p>\n<p><strong>R6</strong>: 75 feet anchored from a horizontal part of a\nlarge tree LDC, forcing you into a fluted waterfall in a chimney. NOTE:\nThere is a 20 foot tree upside down in the rappel line at the base of\nthe drop! Use good judgment in determining whether to rappel behind the\ntree or over it. In any normal flow, this is not somewhere you want to\nbecome stuck, as you can get hypothermic quickly. Make damn sure your\npull rope is on the outside of this tree, otherwise your block will jam\non the tree when you pull your rope!</p>\n<p>Downclimb the super slimy chockstone and slide off the end into\nshallow pool. Depth check first for new rocks, logs, and other debris.\nThere is a rappel anchor off a large dead tree, but the rappel is super\nawkward and normally results in bashing yourself into the chockstone\nsince there is no footing under it.</p>\n<p><strong>R7&amp;R8</strong>: 40+25 feet anchored from bolts with\nchains and rings LDC. Rappel down narrow crack which can be a little\nawkward, and into the full brunt of the waterflow. Fist touchdown is on\na big chockstone that is super slippery, but continue another 25 feet to\npool below. The last person should stop at the chockstone, anchor into\nthe R8 bolts with rings RDC head level, pull the rope, thread through\nthe rings and rappel R8 separately from R7. If you don't use the R8\nanchor, then there is a significant chance your rope will get stuck\nbehind this chockstone when you pull it from the bottom of R8. Many\nropes have been stuck here!</p>\n<p><strong>R9</strong>: 78 feet anchored from bolts with chains RDC;\nthere is a short down-climb to access these bolt. This is the Monkeyface\n\"money drop\", where everyone takes pictures, including the banner and\nflow reference pictures. Be careful once on rappel guiding your rope\ninto the slot, once you clear the chockstone as there are some quartz\nshards sticking out of the DCR wall. Several ropes have been core-shot\nhere!</p>\n<p>The canyon opens up to a campsite below the R9 pool. A short hike\ndown leads to 2 options for R10:</p>\n<p><strong>R10</strong>: 30 feet off bolts RDC over a short overhang,\ninto the mud, and then down climb the slab to the next rappel, or\ncontinue the rappel a full 100 feet to the R11 bolts. When the slab is\nwet, staying on rope here is wise!</p>\n<p><strong>R10 alternate</strong>: First, downclimb the slick rock on\nthe left side of the massive boulder (bigger than a bus) canyon center\nbeyond where the creek flows under rocks. Once down on the jumbled rocks\nbetween the massive boulder and the left canyon wall, face up canyon at\nthe \"rabbit hole\" portal underneath the massive boulder. In this portal\nis a short, hidden waterfall, and a rigged fixed line around a pinch\npoint (under water flow at moderate or more). Using this fixed line you\ncan rappel down 5 feet into the portal, and crawl along the low angle,\nsuper slippery bottom over to an anchor. There is a tiny rock chock and\na bolt with ring hanger on the other end of the fixed line. This anchor\npoint allows you to rappel out from under the massive boulder, down the\nwatercourse slabs past a shallow pool to the top of R11 (80 feet). NOTE:\nabove moderate high flow it may be difficult or impossible to safely\naccess this anchor.</p>\n<p><strong>R11</strong>: 88 feet off bolts with chain RDC down low-angle\nfalls. You can easily stay out of the water course here as the slab is\nsuper slippery and most fall over trying to rappel the slimy slope.</p>\n<p>At the bottom of R11 it's easy to exit by hiking up slightly at stay\ncompletely against the left wall. Or you can do the bonus rappel:</p>\n<p><strong>R12</strong>: 25 feet ghost off a dead tree that fell over\nthe drop.</p>\n<h2 id=\"high_water_escape_route\">High-Water Escape Route</h2>\n<p>A high-water escape route has been created using bolts and natural\nanchors. If a canyoneer decides to use it, ample webbing and rapides\nshould be taken to reinforce or build new natural anchors. The rope\nlengths normally taken to descend the canyon should be sufficient for\nthe bypass. The bypass route was intact in June 2021. All rope lengths\nare close approximations. Use safe techniques with an end knot in the\nrope while descending the bypass. The goal of this route is to gain\naccess to a large broken rampway hovering over the flowing water. The\nramp is on canyon right. In this way, the very narrow portion of the\ncanyon can be avoided if it has too much water to be safely descended.\nThere are two entry points to this rampway. The numbering of rappels\nused for this discussion for the main canyon came from the ropewiki\ndescription of July, 2017.</p>\n<p>First entry point is half way between main canyon rappels 4 and 5.\nThere is an obvious side canyon coming in from the west (canyon right,\naka RDC). Climb up about 70 vertical feet above the water to a large oak\ntree. Take the narrow rampway below the rock face, down canyon to the\nright. You may choose to use a natural anchor on a small tree to create\na roped, protected traverse about 54 feet long.</p>\n<p>Second entry point is found between main canyon rappels 6 and 7.\nClimb up an easy class five route on canyon right for about 18 feet.\nJust out of view of the watercourse is a double bolt anchor. It allows\nyou to traverse 45 feet over to bypass anchor #5. This is a nearly\nhorizontal traverse with fall exposure. The first/upper entry point may\nbe easier.</p>\n<p><strong>Bypass rappel #1:</strong> a double bolt station, length 47\nfeet, continue down through brush, small trees and cactus.</p>\n<p><strong>Bypass rappel #2:</strong> a natural anchor from one of many\nlarge bushes, length 82 feet, continue down and to the right.</p>\n<p><strong>Bypass rappel #3:</strong> a double bolt station, length 70\nfeet.</p>\n<p><strong>Bypass rappel #4:</strong> a natural anchor, length 51\nfeet.</p>\n<p><strong>Bypass rappel #5:</strong> a double bolt station, length 75\nfeet, continue generally down the fall line toward thick tall trees\nbelow.</p>\n<p><strong>Bypass rappel #6:</strong> a double bolt station, length 58\nfeet, easily accessible with a small platform at the anchor.</p>\n<p><strong>Bypass rappel #7:</strong> a double bolt station, length 53\nfeet, located on a face with a tiny ledge to stand on. This places you\nin the main canyon downstream of the R9 waterfall and its pool. You are\nnear a room sized boulder that had graffiti, and the premium camp spot\npads. The canyon opens up here. You now only need to complete R10 and\nR11, both of which can be done out of the water flow.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>At the bottom of the final rappel there will be some poison oak\nstraight ahead downstream and to the right. You have two options to\navoid it:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Head left (east) along the slope, you will find a faint trail takes\nyou downhill through a boulder field and further down where the brush\nclears up and a faint trail leads back to the road.</li>\n<li>Drop into the stream and go right (west), follow the stream till it\ndries up and then continue on the dry stream to the road, then circle\nback around to the car.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Watch out for rattlesnakes around the rocks.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<p>Forest <a href=\"Adventure_Pass\" title=\"wikilink\">Adventure Pass</a>\nis not needed at the recommended parking area.</p>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<p><a\nhref=\"http://canyoncollective.com/threads/monkeying-around.17546/\">http://canyoncollective.com/threads/monkeying-around.17546/</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a\nhref=\"http://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.10152922105021103&amp;type=1&amp;l=85853a6330\">Monkeyface\nin full flow</a></li>\n<li><a\nhref=\"http://sangabrielmnts.myfreeforum.org/about5932.html\">http://sangabrielmnts.myfreeforum.org/about5932.html</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>{{#ev:youtube|v=fsed51nFORY}}</p>\n<p>{{#ev:vimeo|107868851}}</p>\n<p>{{#ev:vimeo|147400845}}</p>\n<p>{{#ev:vimeo|206529126}}</p>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Car break-ins are a problem for this canyon; multiple groups have\nhad cars broken into. Do not leave anything in your vehicle! We ran it\non 28 Sept, 2014 and 3 of the 5 cars were broken into. Reported to\nSheriff. Wallets, phone, gps, bag left in view were stolen. They did NOT\nsteal any canyoneering gear that I am aware of. Rope bags etc. not\nstolen. They broke the windows but did not open the doors, all cars were\nstill locked. Most likely so as to not set-off alarms. In addition to\nnot leaving anything in view inside your vehicle you might also consider\nleaving all of the windows down. Another tip might be to park in full\nview of the road, not tucked away, hidden. <a href=\"User:A._Anderson\"\ntitle=\"wikilink\">A. Anderson</a> (<a href=\"User_talk:A._Anderson\"\ntitle=\"wikilink\">talk</a>) 13:29, 29 September 2014 (PDT). Try parking\nin full view of the road, and not tucked away (like at 34.09642,\n-116.95346). Leave as few things as possible in your car, especially\nthose visible from outside, and consider opening your windows so that\nthieves don't break them looking for valuables. Valuables can be hidden\nin the nearby streambed if necessary.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>A resident of Forest Falls has been trying to remove graffiti for\nmany years. He leaves equipment under a large boulder in the bottom\nsection. Nevertheless, the graffiti is accumulating faster than he can\nremove it.
