Aesthetic rock with fun rappels and slides\/downclimbs. The Hall Creek trail allows for quick access and exit. The rock is slippery and the canyon has chilly water, but is overall a fun and easy descent.\n<\/p><p>Hall Creek is rigged as a training canyon. There are short rappel stations on the boulder at the drop-in, and there are multiple options for many of the obstacles. \n(note that at one point this was a ghosting\/natural-anchor-only canyon, but high use was leading to substantial erosion. The current anchors are designed to keep canyoners in the creek)\n<\/p><p>To help steward this important natural resource for everyone to enjoy please:\n<\/p>\n<ul><li>Do not remove any anchors that are listed in the beta<\/li>\n<li>Use the anchors in the beta - do not leave behind ad hoc anchors<\/li>\n<li>Replace damaged webbing &amp; hardware<\/li>\n<li>Leave unlinked bolts unlinked to prevent unnecessary flood damage.<\/li>\n<li>Downclimb in the creek until the established exit trail (do not use the social trail on the hillside above the final downclimb)<\/li><\/ul>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>From I-90, take exit 38. Drive to the parking location marked on the map (a small pullout just east of where Hall Creek crosses the road). This pullout is just uphill of the Olallie State Park parking lot, which requires a Discover Pass. This pullout, as well as the larger pullout for Change Creek and Deception Crags, does not require a Discover Pass.\n<\/p><p>The trail starts from a small gate marked with a 'no shooting or motorized vehicles' sign. Hike up the trail and under the railroad grade bridge. You can get a good view of the creek from where the trail starts to switchback uphill just after the bridge. Go left at a fork to climb these switchbacks. The right side of the fork will take you to the exit. Follow the trail up to the Iron Horse Trail, then wrap around to the right to continue up until you come to the fork marked with the Zig Zag trail on the left and the Hall Creek trail on the right. Go right. The next fork will lead to the bottom of Hall Creek Falls (right) or above the falls (left). Go left, or use this spur trail to check out Hall Creek Falls (a large slab of a waterfall) and the flow. On the left trail, you will soon come to yet another fork. Here, go right, and you'll soon come to the creek a little ways above Hall Creek Falls. You can walk up the creek a little, but this is the location for the entrance to the technical section.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>All directions are given looking downstream.\n<\/p>\n<ul><li>R0: Training boulder (15' traverse, 15' rappel)\n<ul><li>R0a: DCL traverse line bolts to unlinked bolted anchor.
