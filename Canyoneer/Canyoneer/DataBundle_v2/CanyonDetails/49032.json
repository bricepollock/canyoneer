  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>A nice short canyon that could be combined with nearby Change Creek\nto make a more full day. Aesthetic rock with fun rappels and\nslides/downclimbs. The Hall Creek trail allows for quick access and\nexit. The rock is slippery and the canyon has chilly water, but is\noverall a fun and easy descent.</p>\n<p>Hall Creek is rigged as a training canyon. There are short rappel\nstations on the boulder at the drop-in, and there are multiple options\nfor many of the obstacles. (note that at one point this was a\nghosting/natural-anchor-only canyon, but high use was leading to\nsubstantial erosion. The current anchors are designed to keep canyoners\nin the creek)</p>\n<p>To help steward this important natural resource for everyone to enjoy\nplease:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Do not remove any anchors that are listed in the beta</li>\n<li>Use the anchors in the beta - do not leave behind ad hoc\nanchors</li>\n<li>Replace damaged webbing &amp; hardware</li>\n<li>Leave unlinked bolts unlinked to prevent unnecessary flood\ndamage.</li>\n<li>Downclimb in the creek until the established exit trail (do not use\nthe social trail on the hillside above the final downclimb)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>From I-90, take exit 38. Drive to the parking location marked on the\nmap (a small pullout just east of where Hall Creek crosses the road).\nThis pullout is just uphill of the Olallie State Park parking lot, which\nrequires a Discover Pass. This pullout, as well as the larger pullout\nfor Change Creek and Deception Crags, does not require a Discover\nPass.</p>\n<p>The trail starts from a small gate marked with a 'no shooting or\nmotorized vehicles' sign. Hike up the trail and under the railroad grade\nbridge. You can get a good view of the creek from where the trail starts\nto switchback uphill just after the bridge. Go left at a fork to climb\nthese switchbacks. The right side of the fork will take you to the exit.\nFollow the trail up to the Iron Horse Trail, then wrap around to the\nright to continue up until you come to the fork marked with the Zig Zag\ntrail on the left and the Hall Creek trail on the right. Go right. The\nnext fork will lead to the bottom of Hall Creek Falls (right) or above\nthe falls (left). Go left, or use this spur trail to check out Hall\nCreek Falls (a large slab of a waterfall) and the flow. On the left\ntrail, you will soon come to yet another fork. Here, go right, and\nyou'll soon come to the creek a little ways above Hall Creek Falls. You\ncan walk up the creek a little, but this is the location for the\nentrance to the technical section.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>All directions are given looking downstream.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>R0: Training boulder (15' traverse, 15' rappel)\n<ul>\n<li>R0a: DCL traverse line bolts to unlinked bolted anchor. The rock is\nslippery and a retrievable traverse line should be used to access the\nrappel anchor. Optional 12mm hole mid-traverse line to put in a\ntemporary bolt for mid-point practice</li>\n<li>R0b: DCL on the far side of the boulder. Traverse line bolts to\nchain anchor. The chain anchor is exposed, and a retrievable traverse\nline should be used to access it. Optional 12mm hole mid-traverse line\nfor temporary bolt. There is an 8mm hole on the face of the boulder for\na temporary bolt to be used as a deviation (directional). Makes for a\nslightly more pleasant rappel, and provides deviation (directional)\npractice.</li>\n<li>R0c: DCR on the trail-side of the boulder. Use the boulders to rig a\ntraverse line anchor (optional). There is a caving spit (threaded hole\nfor a caving bolt) and a 12mm hole for a temporary bolt to create a\nrappel anchor.</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>S1: DCL 8' - optional slide</li>\n<li>R1: DCR 50' - unlinked bolts</li>\n<li>R2: DCR - this is Hall Creek Falls and is done in two stages.\n<ul>\n<li>R2a - DCR 80' - Unlinked bolts immediately out of the pool at the\nbottom of R1. The first stage can be rigged as the first pitch, and\nrappelled if the rock is wet (the rock is extremely slippery). If the\nrock is dry, this can be rigged as a hand line.</li>\n<li>R2b - DCR 150' - Unlinked bolts on a small hidden face DCR.</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>S2: 10' - this drop can be a bumpy slide but the pool at the bottom\nis plenty deep. Alternatively, this can be downclimbed in-creek to the\nleft of the flow.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Early Exit right at 47.4296,-121.65989</p>\n<ul>\n<li>R3: Log middle, 70’. Alternatively, this can be downclimbed DCR</li>\n<li>R4: DCL 50’ - webbing around a log or rock pinch. Alternatively, DCR\ndry rappel webbing on a tree.</li>\n<li>R5: Log middle, 20'. Alternatively, DCR dry rappel webbing on a\ntree.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Downclimb some slippery slabs. Where it gets steep, there are 12mm\nholes for temporary bolts for anyone uncomfortable downclimbing (or for\nmore practice rappelling).</p>\n<ul>\n<li>R6: DCR 15' - chain anchor. There are 12mm holes for temporary bolts\nto rig a traverse line here. This drop can also be downclimbed canyon\ncenter.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Continue down a series of a few more cascading falls, all of which\ncan be downclimbed near the watercourse, or rappelled using natural\nanchors.</p>\n<p>Exit Right at 47.4323,-121.65910. Once you come within sight of the\nbridge, look for cairns and a small trail on the right that heads up the\nbank.</p>\n<figure>\n<img src=\"Hall_Creek_Topo_2021a.png\" width=\"600\" />\n</figure>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>On the small trail on the right, continue down the right side of the\ncreek a short ways to reconnect with the main trail that leads quickly\nback to the pullout.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<p>None. If parking in the Olallie State Park lot, bring a discover pass\nor pay the day use fee. There are bathrooms in that lot as well.</p>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n",
