{"quality":0,"description":"<div class=\"mw-content-ltr mw-parser-output\" lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><p>Oregon prospect.  The Mule Creek Gorge north of Rogue River Ranch sports a nice-looking, if short, narrows.  Water levels run high in the early season, but may subside later in summer.  Canyon does not appear to be too technical -- with a few short drops along the way. It may be run by locals or river guides already during the summer.\n<\/p>\n<ul><li>A bit further up the trail is the remnants of some old mining equipment.<\/li><\/ul>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>From the east end of the Tucker Flat Campground, follow the trail along the south wall of the gorge for about 10-15min to the bridge.  There are some good views of the narrows below. A short distance north of the bridge, watch for flagging on a tree, marking a user trail that drops into the creek.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Upon exiting the lower end of the narrows, go downstream a short distance.
