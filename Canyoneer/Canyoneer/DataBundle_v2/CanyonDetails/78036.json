When the hikingpath goes steep down\nto the start, the canyon starts directly when you arrive at the\nstream.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>Some nice waterfalls but too open and low flow in march.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<p>Probably forbidden. We arrived late at the parking, when the entry to\nthe park was already closed (1pm) and sneeked in, which was quite a\nmission with all the rangers. After the firstdescent we came back in the\ndark, when everyone was gone.</p>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n"
