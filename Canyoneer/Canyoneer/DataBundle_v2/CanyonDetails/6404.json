  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>Rock Creek is a scenic canyon in the Olympic National Forest on the\nsoutheast corner of the Olympic Peninsula. After a bit of slippery\ncreekwalking, the canyon features multiple rapid fire rappels into a\nsteep valley leading to the South Fork Skokomish River. Run as a\nshort/half day, or combine with nearby LeBar Creek or Fir Creek for a\nfull day of canyoning.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>From Hwy 101 north of Shelton, WA, turn left onto W Skokomish Valley\nRoad, which eventually turns into FR 23. Drive about 11.4 miles from the\nhighway to the parking area. Park at the pullout just west of the\nculvert where FR 23 crosses Rock creek (47.3743, -123.3172). Suit up\nhere.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Checkpoint is the falls coming out from under the bridge.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>DCR = Down Canyon Right</p>\n<p>DCL = Down Canyon Left</p>\n<p><em>This canyon features numerous jumps. Always check pools for\ndepth/debris before jumping! As of 2023, some pools in this canyon have\nbeen filled in with gravel and are shallower than in prior\nyears.</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>R0</strong>: For extra bonus points, rig from the guardrail\nand rappel off the bridge (~60ft). If you leave an anchor, please\nretrieve it when you return to your car. This rappel is a fun free-hang\nover the culvert, then down a short cascade. Alternately, find a small\nuse trail on the downstream side of the culvert and walk into the\ncreek.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>J1</strong>: Jump 8’ or downclimb. There is an abandoned\ntruck upside down in the creekbed just after this drop.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>R1/J2</strong>: Jump 12’ from DCR into a narrow hallway.\nThis falls has crisscrossing jets of water. If jumping, beware of\nsloping rock surface underwater on DCL. Stay close to the right side.\nAlternatively, rappel from tree DCL, or bypass by downclimbing far\nDCR.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>R2/J3</strong>: DCR - 35’ from a log that\nalmost-but-not-quite spans the canyon. Consider treating this log as a\nmarginal anchor. Alternatively, jump 15' DCL.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>R3</strong>: Single bolt above the chute DCR - 12'. In\nmoderate to high flow, the boil in this pool can push swimmers into the\nback of the pool. It is recommended to set the rope length properly to\navoid entanglement in this pool. For less confident swimmers, consider\nhaving a teammate at the edge of the pool with a throw rope to help them\nescape the pushy water.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>R4/J4</strong>: DCL - 12' from a single bolt. Alternatively,\njump from the rim of the pothole DCR. As of 2023, the pool below is\nquite shallow. Use caution.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Immediately after the J4 pool, the canyon splits into two channels,\noffering different options for the final section of the canyon:</p>\n<p><strong>Option 1: The Mossy Wall</strong></p>\n<p>DCL: This is a multi-pitch rappel that keeps you in or alongside the\nflow. It is the preferred later season / lower flow route.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>R5a (1st pitch)</strong>: 35' from unlinked bolts to a\nrebelay station / chain anchor. The rebelay anchor is DCR just over a\nlip obscured behind a rock knob. (It is possible to skip the rebelay for\na 110' rappel to the bottom but this will require you to rappel in the\nflow. The rope pull may also be harder.)</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>R5b (2nd Pitch)</strong>: 60’ from the rebelay to the pool.\nThis line allows you to rappel in or out of the flow.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Option 2: The Lagoon</strong></p>\n<p>DCR: This sequence drops you into a large, deep pothole, followed by\na bolted rappel. When the canyon is flowing moderate or lower, this side\nof the canyon becomes a dry route, and the water in the pothole can\nbecome stagnant, making it a better early season route. Use caution at\nit may also become a keeper pothole that is difficult to escape as the\nwater level drops.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>R6a / J5</strong>: (aka The Mosquito Pool): 40’ from a tree\nDCR into the pothole. This pothole can be jumped from the side (30') -\nthe edges slope slightly, but the vast majority of it is upwards of 15'\ndeep. Warning: this pool may be a keeper pothole in low water.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>R6b</strong>: 80' from a bolted Y-hang anchor DCR of the\npothole, down a sloping chute to the bottom.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>Just downstream of the final rappel, Rock Creek merges with Flat\nCreek (which is anything but flat) entering on the right via a small\nfalls. The initial steepness of the exit is mercifully counterbalanced\nby the short distance back to the road.</p>\n<p>To exit:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Climb up flat creek, staying in the watercourse. It becomes thick\nwith vegetation at times, but is mostly an easy scramble.</li>\n<li>After you've gone further than you think you should, look for a\nyellow forest service boundary sign slightly up the hillside on the\nright side of the creek, with pink flagging on top. This sign is quite\nlow to the ground, and requires your team keeping an eye out for it.\nNearby is some blue and pink flagging. At the sign, begin to switchback\nuphill.</li>\n<li>A dry, stripped log will allow you to traverse below a steep face -\nfrom that log, head uphill through steep scree along a social trail.\nFrom here, it's not far to the road.</li>\n<li>Walk the road back to the parking area.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<p>The canyon crosses briefly onto private timber land in the very last\nsection of the canyon. The exit back to the main road brings you back\ninto the Olympic National Forest.</p>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media_1\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background_1\">Background</h2>\n",
