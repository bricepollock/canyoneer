While Butte Creek\nwas not overrun by the Labor Day wildfires of 2020, the access road was.\nGiven the closure of this road, the canyon is still effectively closed.\nPlease respect the closure. This page will be updated when the canyon\nre-opens.</font></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Update 2023: Area reportedly will be reopened on Oct 31, 2023 or\nwhen \"operations are completed\" whichever comes first. <a\nhref=\"https://www.oregon.gov/odf/recreation/pages/santiam-state-forest.aspx\">Closure\ninformation.</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Butte Creek is a short and scenic canyon in the Santiam State Forest.\nAlthough it could be done in an hour, the ease and fun of repeating\nobstacles will make you want to linger longer. Flowing waterfalls and\nlarge cold pools makes a wetsuit required year round. Use care when\ntraveling in this canyon. It is extremely slippery, even with\nspecialized canyoning footwear.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><img src=\"rwl_en.png\" title=\"rwl_en.png\" alt=\"rwl_en.png\" /><a\nhref=\"https://waterdata.usgs.gov/or/nwis/uv/?site_no=14201500&amp;PARAmeter_cd=00065,00060\">Link\nto USGS gauge for Butte Creek at Monitor</a></li>\n<li><a\nhref=\"https://www.oregon.gov/odf/recreation/Pages/nonmotorizedtrails.aspx#trailreports\">Recreation\nReport: Santiam State Forest</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>Park at the Butte Creek trailhead and follow the well maintained\ntrail right a 0.25mi to the bottom of Upper Butte Creek Falls. From here\nyou can gauge the waterflow on the first rappel. Hike back up the trail\npart way until you reach the point on the trail where you are just a bit\nupstream of Upper Butte Creek Falls. Follow a use-trail down into the\ndrainage above R1.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>R1: 25' + additional rope depending on what anchor you use. If\nconditions are good, this falls can be jumped. There is a cave behind\nthe waterfall you can walk into.</li>\n</ul>\n<figure>\n<img src=\"UpperButteCreekFalls.jpg\"\ntitle=\"view from behind the waterfall|400px\" />\n<figcaption>view from behind the waterfall|400px</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>Downstream of R1 is a small waterfall and chute that can be jumped\n(about 8'), stemmed, or bypassed. Use caution if entering the water here\nas it is close to R2 and, in high flow, current could sweep you over the\nnext drop.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>R2: 70ft + additional rope depending on what anchor you use.\nCurrently a tree back DCL for about 105ft total. This puts you right in\nthe flow at the top which can be quite pushy even at lower volume.\nAnother anchor may be advisable in high flow. Use caution moving around\nabove the falls; this falls has been the site of at least one major\naccident. Middle Butte Falls is erroneously referred to as Lower Butte\nFalls on the map.</li>\n</ul>\n<figure>\n<img src=\"MiddleButteCreekFalls.jpg\"\ntitle=\"looking down from anchor DCR|600px\" />\n<figcaption>looking down from anchor DCR|600px</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<ul>\n<li>R3: 30'. It is possible to rappel half way and jump the rest from a\nledge. The only obvious anchor is a tree DCL and back from the main\nwater channel. You can rappel DCL completely avoiding the channel or rap\nin the flow. (Note that the latter could be a hard pull, but it is easy\nto simply retrieve your rope on the way out.) Rappelling in the flow\nfrom the tree would be approximately 80ft total. For the very daring, it\nmay be possible to jump about 45ft from the tower. Likewise, a jump of\nabout 25-30ft DCL away from the channel is likely possible clearing two\nlogs.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>A somewhat exposed scramble with good holds DCL up to the hiking\ntrail on the ridge.</p>\n<p>About 70ft down from the final pool find a climber's trail going up\nsteeply DCL and then cutting back along the wall to the top of R3.\nContinue to hug the wall right up-canyon and find the trail continuing\nup and out of the area above the pool for R2. Switchback back left and\nshortly arrive at the main trail.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<p>Be aware: unlike other parts of the country, canyoning is not widely\nknown or recognized in the Pacific NW. Individuals climbing, rappelling,\nor slack-lining around such \"show waterfalls\" are far more likely to\ngarner negative reactions from the general public at large. Negative\nreactions can lead to complaints and more rules by the local\nauthorities. Locals suggest descending Butte Creek when the number of\nhikers will be low - e.g. early in the morning or on weekdays. Please be\nscrupulous about following a Leave-No-Trace ethic. Leaving brightly\ncolored anchors can annoy waterfall photographers, irk land managers,\nand may encourage the inexperienced / unprepared to attempt to follow\nyou. An easy option at Butte Creek is to hike back up to the top of the\nfalls at the end of the day and remove your anchors.</p>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><img src=\"rwl_en.png\" title=\"rwl_en.png\" alt=\"rwl_en.png\" /><a\nhref=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20210527212206/www.canyoneeringnorthwest.com/ButteCreek/Butte_Creek.php\">CanyoneeringNorthwest.com\n(archive.org)</a> : Butte Creek</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n<p>A cave (a tree mold made from balsatic lava flow) is nearby the\nmiddle falls (44°55'39.21\", -122°30'57.02\")</p>\n<p>Link: <a\nhref=\"http://www.oregon.gov/odf/northcascade/docs/color_butte_creek.pdf\">http://www.oregon.gov/odf/northcascade/docs/color_butte_creek.pdf</a></p>\n",
