(Per a ranger in July 2024, there are no plans to reopen this road in the near future.) The new approach is via Family Camp Road on the east side of Butte Creek above the Molalla River. As of 2024, Google Maps provided the correct directions for reaching the trailhead. There is parking at the trailhead for several vehicles and a restroom. \n<\/p>\n<ul><li>You could also park at the campground further upstream and hike to the falls from there.<\/li><\/ul>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading3\"><h3 id=\"Hiking_In\">Hiking In<\/h3><\/div>\n<p>From Butte Creek trailhead and follow the maintained trail right ~0.25mi to the bottom of Upper Butte Creek Falls.

Beware hitting anyone in the landing zone when deploying your rope.<\/li><\/ul>\n<p><br \/>\n<\/p>\n<ul><li>A short walk downstream, the creek funnels into a tight slot-like feature. Options: downclimb (or rappel) into the slot and swim out through the falls, or bypass DCL. Further along the slot it's possible to jump (~8ft) into a pool, but check the depth first. Use caution in high flow, as strong current could sweep you over R2. In lower flow, the slot and pool below is safe to swim in.<\/li><\/ul>\n<ul><li><b>R2: Middle Butte Falls.<\/b> 120ft from tree DCL. This puts you right in the flow at the top of the falls which can be pushy even at low volume. It's possible to use a rock knob DCR at the brink as a natural redirect to keep you out of the torrent. Be aware: water at the bottom is shallow! This waterfall is erroneously referred to as Lower Butte Falls on the map. Use caution moving around on slippery rock above the falls; this area has been the site of at least one accident.<\/li><\/ul>\n<ul><li><ul><li>High flow: use a different anchor.

Locals suggest descending Butte Creek when the number of hikers will be low - e.g. early in the morning or on weekdays. Please be scrupulous about following a Leave-No-Trace ethic. Leaving brightly colored anchors can annoy waterfall photographers, irk land managers, and may encourage the inexperienced \/ unprepared to attempt to follow you.  An easy option at Butte Creek is to hike back up to the top of the falls at the end of the day and remove your anchors.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Beta_sites\">Beta sites<\/h2><\/div>\n<ul><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20210527212206\/www.canyoneeringnorthwest.com\/ButteCreek\/Butte_Creek.php\">CanyoneeringNorthwest.com (archive.org)<\/a> &#160;: Butte Creek<\/li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https:\/\/waterdata.usgs.gov\/or\/nwis\/uv\/?site_no=14201500&amp;PARAmeter_cd=00065,00060\">Link to USGS gauge for Butte Creek at Monitor<\/a> - this gauge may be decommissioned after Oct 2024 per lack of funding.<\/li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https:\/\/www.oregon.gov\/odf\/recreation\/Pages\/nonmotorizedtrails.aspx#trailreports\">Recreation Report: Santiam State Forest<\/a><\/li><\/ul>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Background\">Background<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>A cave (a tree mold made from balsatic lava flow) is nearby the middle falls (44°55'39.21\", -122°30'57.02\")\n<\/p>\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nParsed by mw‐api‐ext.codfw.main‐6779cc57fc‐f8w9b\nCached time: 20240914192110\nCache expiry: 2592000\nReduced expiry: false\nComplications: []\nCPU time usage: 0.004 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.005 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 9\/1000000\nPost‐expand include size: 0\/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 0\/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 2\/100\nExpensive parser function count: 0\/500\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0\/20\nUnstrip post‐expand size: 0\/5000000 bytes\nNumber of Wikibase entities loaded: 0\/400\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%    0.000      1 -total\n-->\n<\/div>"}
