  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>Don't bother. If you are in the area just do Horsetank. It's the same\napproach except you go over a ridge to Puppy Love. Puppy Love drops into\nHorsetank after the first 1 or 2 rappels.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>Same as Horsetank, once you reach Horsetank, go up the canyon just a\nbit until you see a break in the ridge above, work your way up the\nridge. Continue up until you reach the top of the ridge. We went left\n(Southwest) but you can probably just continue West until you find a\nplace to drop in. That will avoid the hour of rock hopping to get to the\ntechnical part.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>Depending on where you drop-in, it can be up to an hour of rock\nhopping before the first rappel of 15 feet. Shortly down canyon there is\nan 8 foot downclimb (if dry) or rappel off a nice pass through\nanchor/webbing. the final rappel is through a scenic crack from webbing\ntied around a log. After the final rappel, it is just a short distance\nto Horsetank.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>After completing Horsetank, you'll hike down to a confluence of\nSandrock Canyon.</p>\n<p>Head up Sandrock Canyon.</p>\n<p>20' class 4 climb up a dry fall.</p>\n<p>40' class 5.1 climb up dry fall starting up crack RUC.</p>\n<p>Right up steep mostly dirt gully, do not go all the way up. Find the\nfirst easy ledge on left.</p>\n<p>Traverse left on the ledge.</p>\n<p>40' class 5.1 climb up a dry fall.</p>\n<p>Bypass next dry fall on RUC gully taking first easy ledge left.</p>\n<p>As soon as it flattens out enough on RUC, go right toward Soldier\nMesa and back to start.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><img src=\"rwl_en.png\" title=\"rwl_en.png\" alt=\"rwl_en.png\" /><a\nhref=\"http://ropewiki.com/User:Super_Amazing_Map?id=Puppy_Love_-_Arizona\">Super\nAmazing Map</a> : Puppy Love</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n",
