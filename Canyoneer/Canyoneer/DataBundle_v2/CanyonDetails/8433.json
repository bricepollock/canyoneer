Please use extreme caution when descending the creek. Between landslides, fallen trees, and loose rocks, this area may be unstable and dangerous for years go come. The canyon may have changed dramatically. Do not rely on the beta below being accurate.\n<\/p><p>While Mist Falls towers at 520 ft, it is frequently disregarded due to its proximity to Multnomah Falls and smaller water shed. The falls feature a unique orange-tinted basalt column band that make the falls more distinct and scenic than the other (but still impressive) seasonsal runoffs that plunge off the cliffs of the Columbia River Gorge.  Mist Falls is best seen in its entirety from Bensen State Park, driving back on the I-84W, or from Prindle (Washington side of the Gorge).  While several waterfall websites mention that the drops are 220' and 300', respectively, we found the rappel lengths to be 290' and 300'.\n<\/p><p>Please note that the topo maps for the location of Mist Falls is incorrect. The map displayed on this page shows the correct location of the falls.\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Flow during Spring time seems to be ideal as the falls may lessen or dry up during the Summer. To get an idea of water flow levels, park at the parking spot and hike a few minutes up a short, crumbly, and steep trail up to the base of the falls (this will also be the exit hike). After viewing the falls from the base, hike back down to the parking spot and hike East along the Old Scenic Columbia River Gorge road for 1\/4 miles until you reach the Wahkeena Creek trailhead. \n<\/p><p>Follow the approach route Angels Rest Trail 415 until you veer off the trail for some bushwhacking down the creek. Long pants, long sleeves, and gloves are highly recommended. Bushwhacking not only consists of your typical downed logs, ferns, and branches, but also includes a forest of spine-covered plants called Devil's Club. The spines are heavily concentrated across the entire plant and make blackberry bushes look like child's play. Taking the depicted shortcut will drop you into the creek close to the first rappel. This shortcut route has not been confirmed, but may cut off a lot of the Devil's Club nightmare. The creek is heavily overgrown and possibly very muddy and slippery. Every step in the creek will require careful footing and looking at which branches are \"friendly\" to hold.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<ul><li>R1: 290'. Webbing wrapped around a downed log spanning the creek (about 6 feet high from the ground), that is still alive and growing. A path has been cleared from the brush to allow for a cleaner pull but bringing a pair of branch trimmers wouldn't hurt.<\/li>\n<li>R2: 300'. Webbing wrapped around a bush perched at the ledge RDC. The webbing extends all the way to the edge of the drop, so a courtesy anchor is recommended for everyone except LAMAR.<\/li><\/ul>\n<p>You will not be able to see or hear the rappeller from either drop. Climb up RDC to a small plateau that overlooks the Gorge and look for a tree that precariously hangs over the clff. If you carefully lean over and hug this tree, you will be able to see people at the base of the first and last drop (use proper anchoring techniques as backup).  Whistle signals can be heard from this view point but using hand signals will also help with communications.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Hike back down the scree-sloped trail back to the car.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Red_tape\">Red tape<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Beta_sites\">Beta sites<\/h2><\/div>\n<ul><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http:\/\/ropewiki.com\/User:Super_Amazing_Map?id=Mist_Falls_-_Oregon\">Super Amazing Map<\/a> &#160;: Mist Falls<\/li><\/ul>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media<\/h2><\/div>\n<ul><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http:\/\/www.waterfallsnorthwest.com\/nws\/falls.php?num=4056\">WaterFalls North West<\/a><\/li><\/ul>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Background\">Background<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>This canyon was first descended by Tiffanie Lin, Luca Chiarabini, Michelle Nilles, and Erik Bernhoft on March 28, 2015.\n<\/p>\n\n\n<\/div>","quality":3.5,"timeRating":"II","rappelLongestMeters":91.44,"version":"a9923c96d40c890831eca2e0b09d4d5904b6c7abadbcc350a83e633d5782b43f","technicalRating":3,"id":8433,"riskRating":"R","name":"Mist Falls","rappelCountMin":2,"longitude":-122.1325,"shuttleSeconds":null,"waterRating":"B","url":"https:\/\/ropewiki.com\/Mist_Falls","vehicle":"Passenger","latitude":45.5738}
