  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p><strong>Status: OPEN</strong></p>\n<p>Be aware: this creek was overrun by the Eagle Creek wildfire in\nSeptember 2017. Please use extreme caution when descending the creek.\nBetween landslides, fallen trees, and loose rocks, this area may be\nunstable and dangerous for years go come. The canyon may have changed\ndramatically. Do not rely on the beta below being accurate.</p>\n<p>While Mist Falls towers at 520 ft, it is frequently disregarded due\nto its proximity to Multnomah Falls and smaller water shed. The falls\nfeature a unique orange-tinted basalt column band that make the falls\nmore distinct and scenic than the other (but still impressive) seasonsal\nrunoffs that plunge off the cliffs of the Columbia River Gorge. Mist\nFalls is best seen in its entirety from Bensen State Park, driving back\non the I-84W, or from Prindle (Washington side of the Gorge). While\nseveral waterfall websites mention that the drops are 220' and 300',\nrespectively, we found the rappel lengths to be 290' and 300'.</p>\n<p>Please note that the topo maps for the location of Mist Falls is\nincorrect. The map displayed on this page shows the correct location of\nthe falls.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>Flow during Spring time seems to be ideal as the falls may lessen or\ndry up during the Summer. To get an idea of water flow levels, park at\nthe parking spot and hike a few minutes up a short, crumbly, and steep\ntrail up to the base of the falls (this will also be the exit hike).\nAfter viewing the falls from the base, hike back down to the parking\nspot and hike East along the Old Scenic Columbia River Gorge road for\n1/4 miles until you reach the Wahkeena Creek trailhead.</p>\n<p>Follow the approach route Angels Rest Trail 415 until you veer off\nthe trail for some bushwhacking down the creek. Long pants, long\nsleeves, and gloves are highly recommended. Bushwhacking not only\nconsists of your typical downed logs, ferns, and branches, but also\nincludes a forest of spine-covered plants called Devil's Club. The\nspines are heavily concentrated across the entire plant and make\nblackberry bushes look like child's play. Taking the depicted shortcut\nwill drop you into the creek close to the first rappel. This shortcut\nroute has not been confirmed, but may cut off a lot of the Devil's Club\nnightmare. The creek is heavily overgrown and possibly very muddy and\nslippery. Every step in the creek will require careful footing and\nlooking at which branches are \"friendly\" to hold.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>R1: 290'. Webbing wrapped around a downed log spanning the creek\n(about 6 feet high from the ground), that is still alive and growing. A\npath has been cleared from the brush to allow for a cleaner pull but\nbringing a pair of branch trimmers wouldn't hurt.</li>\n<li>R2: 300'. Webbing wrapped around a bush perched at the ledge RDC.\nThe webbing extends all the way to the edge of the drop, so a courtesy\nanchor is recommended for everyone except LAMAR.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You will not be able to see or hear the rappeller from either drop.\nClimb up RDC to a small plateau that overlooks the Gorge and look for a\ntree that precariously hangs over the clff. If you carefully lean over\nand hug this tree, you will be able to see people at the base of the\nfirst and last drop (use proper anchoring techniques as backup). Whistle\nsignals can be heard from this view point but using hand signals will\nalso help with communications.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>Hike back down the scree-sloped trail back to the car.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><img src=\"rwl_en.png\" title=\"rwl_en.png\" alt=\"rwl_en.png\" /><a\nhref=\"http://ropewiki.com/User:Super_Amazing_Map?id=Mist_Falls_-_Oregon\">Super\nAmazing Map</a> : Mist Falls</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a\nhref=\"http://www.waterfallsnorthwest.com/nws/falls.php?num=4056\">WaterFalls\nNorth West</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n<p>This canyon was first descended by Tiffanie Lin, Luca Chiarabini,\nMichelle Nilles, and Erik Bernhoft on March 28, 2015.</p>\n",
