{"rappelLongestMeters":30,"description":"<div class=\"mw-content-ltr mw-parser-output\" lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><p>A high quality canyon with everything. Close to Leura this canyon includes two abseils of 26 &amp; 30 metres on approach and a single abseil of ~15 metres in canyon actual. Navigation in the canyon is straightforward with many scrambles, jumps (optional), swims and even a small cave along the length of the canyon. The canyon has several opportunities for impressive photographs. The exit involves three small rock climbs (Ewbank grade 14, 12, 19) of which the 3rd one usually has a hand-line to assist the climber. Lead rock climbing and belay skills are <b>required<\/b>. Take 5 quickdraws. Slow parties on the climb should let faster parties past... this is good etiquette.\n<\/p><p><br \/>\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading3\"><h3 id=\"Water_levels\">Water levels<\/h3><\/div>\n<ul><li>Arethusa Canyon has a ~25 km&#178; catchment which includes Upper and Lower Cascade Creek dams.<\/li>\n<li>After rain Arethusa water levels can increase significantly.<\/li>\n<li>There is no river gauge for Govetts Creek<\/li>\n<li>A very rough but sometimes relevant reading can be taken at the <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https:\/\/waterinsights.waternsw.com.au\/12964-sydney-drinking-water-catchment\/river-data#212291\">Grose river gauge<\/a> a long way downstream, with a ~668 km&#178; catchment.
