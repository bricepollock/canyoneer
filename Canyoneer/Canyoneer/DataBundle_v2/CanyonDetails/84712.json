This does involve almost 800m of elevation gain. \n2) With a 78km shuttle the easier option is to park at the reservoir carpark and follow the maintained Rocky Creek firetrail to the campsite.\n<\/p><p>Either option, you will need to drop off the trail about 300m west of the bridge over rocky creek, near where the track turns North over the implied knoll.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Scramble down the frosty Rocky Creek, wading at times. \nMost waterfalls can be climbed around, but three have significant exposure and are better abseiled. \nThe longest abseil is 20m.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>The last scrambling is at the junction to Bunyip Creek after which it's just a matter of following the stream down. \nAbout 900m before the road there is an abandoned mining race on the river right, which can be followed back to the approach track (if you climbed up the steep western face)\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Red_tape\">Red tape<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Beta_sites\">Beta sites<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Background\">Background<\/h2><\/div>\n\n\n<\/div>","id":84712,"riskRating":null,"months":["Nov","Dec","Jan","Feb","Mar"],"waterRating":"A","latitude":-36.7559,"vehicle":"High Clearance","quality":2,"technicalRating":3,"version":"e32e840d34583234f7b1169929d8cb0ff3bd5e2d20434aa3a0df06d9e22c3571","rappelLongestMeters":20,"shuttleSeconds":null,"rappelCountMax":3,"longitude":146.7234}
