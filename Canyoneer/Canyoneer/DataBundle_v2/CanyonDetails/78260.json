  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>Miners first discovered this canyon mine prospecting and left remains\nalong the way. A short but fun narrow canyon that drops rapidly to the\nColorado River. Do not enter this canyon if you do not have the\nknowledge to entirely inspect and replace anchorage. Do not assume\nanchorage is prepared to hold any load bearing weight upon your arrival.\nBring anchorage replacement material and be prepared to replace all\nanchorage. This canyon floods and becomes hot. The sunbaked and worn\nwebbing can break. Inspect and Replace all anchorage.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>Approach is from Gold Strike Canyon. There is a break along the way\nthat takes you up a 4th class scramble to a saddle where you get great\nviews of the river and the bridge. You will have to pick your way down a\nsteep slickrock slope by heading right.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>Once in the canyon you will head into some narrow corridors and find\n6 raps up to 120 ft. A couple raps are overhung, and all of the raps\nhave webbing. Do not place bolts in the canyon. You will notice miners\nplaced eye bolts in the canyon when they prospected through the region\nin the past. Eventually you will come to a beautiful hot spring aquafer\ndischarge where hanging gardens with hot spring water rain down. One\ncavern you can enter and it will rain hot spring water just like a\nshower. walk a short distance to the river, inflate your packraft and\nhead for your exit.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>Options for exit include a short float to nearby Boyscout Canyon with\nhotsprings and an engaging 4th/5th class scramble up, or Secret Canyon\nfor less gain/distance but against the river's current.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<p>Do not place bolts in this canyon or any canyon. Bring webbing and\nRapides to change anchorage. You must have a USCG approved raft and PFD.\nhave a shuttle car set up at the secret canyon or boyscout trailhead if\nyou are using those exits.</p>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n<p>Originally and still known as Emery Canyon by the first known\ncomplete descent in 2013. Murl Emery was a legendary riverman of the\nColorado during the Hoover Dam construction era. <a\nhref=\"http://www.hooverdamnotes.com/murl-emery.html\">http://www.hooverdamnotes.com/murl-emery.html</a>.\nThere is also an amazing biography of his life entitled \"Desert\nRiverman: The Free-Spirited Adventures of Murl Emery\" a phenomenal\nread.</p>\n",
