It begins below the Benson Plateau and flows southeast to its confluence with Eagle Creek. The basalt canyon contains at least nine waterfalls. Access to the canyon requires a long, steep approach and a significant exit hike in comparison to many other established canyon routes in the area, making for a vigorous wilderness outing.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading3\"><h3 id=\"Waterflow\">Waterflow<\/h3><\/div>\n<p>Four Mile Creek is fed by a combination of springs, snowmelt, rainwater, and groundwater seepage. The Benson Plateau often holds snow into the month of May. The canyon is probably most exciting during a short window soon after the majority of snow has melted from the Benson Plateau, but be cautious of the waterflow level in Eagle Creek for the exit.\n<\/p><p><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https:\/\/www.nrcs.usda.gov\/wps\/portal\/nrcs\/detail\/or\/snow\/products\/?cid=nrcs142p2_046288\">Greenpoint SNOTEL<\/a>  |  <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https:\/\/www.nrcs.usda.gov\/wps\/portal\/nrcs\/detail\/or\/snow\/products\/?cid=nrcs142p2_046314\">North Fork SNOTEL<\/a>\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>The original route involved following the Eagle Creek trail ~5.5mi to a junction, then breaking off on the Eagle Benson Trail to ascend the ridge to approximately 2mi, 2600ft elevation, then dropping down steep slopes into the creek.

This area will likely be a mess for years to come.\n<\/p><p>There has been discussion about descending Four Mile Creek in combination with a section of Eagle Creek for a nice full-day canyon outing. It is possible that there is a bushwhack approach from game trails that begin near a campsite on Eagle Creek upstream of 4 1\/2 mile bridge, to Four Mile Creek just upstream of R8 (elev. 850 ft). However, when the waterflow in Four Mile Creek is fun (moderate to high), it is likely that the waterflow in Eagle Creek will be too high to descend safely.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p><b>R1<\/b> (elev. 2,438 ft): 52 ft from tree DCL\n<\/p><p><b>Downclimb<\/b> (elev. 2,073 ft): 16 ft\n<\/p><p><b>R2<\/b> (<a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http:\/\/www.waterfallsnorthwest.com\/nws\/falls.php?num=4026\">Upper Four Mile Falls<\/a>, elev. 1,699 ft): 85 ft from large tree DCL\n<\/p><p><b>R3<\/b> (elev. 1,601 ft): 30 ft (predicted low-angle rappel)\n<\/p><p><b>R4<\/b> (elev. 1,549 ft): 56 ft probably from a tree DCR\n<\/p>\n<ul><li>Photo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http:\/\/www.oregonhikers.org\/forum\/download\/file.php?id=6974&amp;mode=view\">29 Jun 2009<\/a><\/li><\/ul>\n<p><b>R5<\/b> (elev. 1,407 ft): 30 ft in two stages probably from a tree\n<\/p>\n<ul><li>Photo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http:\/\/www.oregonhikers.org\/forum\/download\/file.php?id=6973&amp;mode=view\">29 Jun 2009<\/a><\/li><\/ul>\n<p><b>R6<\/b> (<a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http:\/\/www.waterfallsnorthwest.com\/nws\/falls.php?num=4025\">Middle Four Mile Falls<\/a>, elev. 1,399 ft): 112 ft probably from a tree DCL\n<\/p>\n<ul><li>Photos: <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http:\/\/www.oregonhikers.org\/forum\/download\/file.php?id=6533&amp;mode=view\">15 Jun 2009<\/a> | <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http:\/\/www.oregonhikers.org\/forum\/download\/file.php?id=6972&amp;mode=view\">29 Jun 2009<\/a>  |  <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http:\/\/www.oregonhikers.org\/forum\/download\/file.php?id=6971&amp;mode=view\">29 Jun 2009 (Top)<\/a><\/li><\/ul>\n<p><b>R7<\/b> (elev. 1,119 ft): 30 ft probably from a log in the logjam\n<\/p>\n<ul><li>Photo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http:\/\/www.oregonhikers.org\/forum\/download\/file.php?id=6575&amp;mode=view\">15 Jun 2009<\/a><\/li><\/ul>\n<p><b>R8<\/b> (approx. elev. 850 ft): 12 ft probably from a boulder in the watercourse\n<\/p>\n<ul><li>Photos: <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http:\/\/www.oregonhikers.org\/forum\/download\/file.php?id=6209&amp;mode=view\">4 Jun 2009<\/a> | <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http:\/\/www.oregonhikers.org\/forum\/download\/file.php?id=6577&amp;mode=view\">15 Jun 2009<\/a><\/li><\/ul>\n<p><b>R9<\/b> (<a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http:\/\/www.waterfallsnorthwest.com\/nws\/falls.php?num=3893\">Four Mile Falls<\/a>, Tier 1, elev. 810 ft): 57 ft in two stages\n<\/p>\n<ul><li>Stage 1: 49 ft perhaps from a tree DCL into a deep pool.

This could be easy or dangerous depending on waterflowâ€”risk of foot entrapment is significant, and Skoonichuk Falls is not too far downstream. On 14 May 2016, we crossed on the upstream side of the confluence where the water was maximum 2.5 ft (0.75 m) deep; there was one small area where the water was slightly more forceful, and we gave each other a hand for security. In higher waterflow, it may be necessary to employ more more sophisticated swift water crossing techniques. The island is a convenient location to change out of wetsuits when the waterflow is low enough that only shallow, calm pools separate it from trail on the west bank.\n<\/p><p>If Eagle Creek is too high to cross safely, it may be possible (unverified) to place a fixed rope on the south side of Four Mile Creek, downstream of the last rappel, allowing access to the Eagle Creek Trail just upstream of 4 1\/2 Mile Bridge via game trails. To reach the slope above the stream to rig the rope (prior to making the descent), cross 4 1\/2 Mile Bridge to the east side of Eagle Creek, and hike on game trails from the campsite just upstream of the bridge.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Red_tape\">Red tape<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading3\"><h3 id=\"Parking\">Parking<\/h3><\/div>\n<p>Parking at the Eagle Creek trailhead requires a Northwest Forest Pass.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading3\"><h3 id=\"Wilderness_permit_and_regulations\">Wilderness permit and regulations<\/h3><\/div>\n<p>Wilderness Permits are required for both day use and overnight use from Memorial Day Weekend until Oct. 31.
