{"riskRating":null,"description":"<div class=\"mw-content-ltr mw-parser-output\" lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><p><br \/>\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Getting_There\">Getting There<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Access to the Parking area is via a dirt road off of I-70, but there isn't an actual freeway exit.  Instead there is, what I'm calling, a shoulder exit\/entrance immediately off of I-70 (one on Westbound I-70 and another on Eastbound I-70).  You just pull off to the shoulder and exit the freeway onto a dirt road and proceed through a gate in the fence.  There is a culvert running under the freeway that enables access to either the westbound or eastbound lanes of I-70, as well as the dirt roads running north or south of the freeway.  Not all vehicles will fit in this culvert so there is a dirt strip in the median that allows you to drive across I-70.  For safety reasons, it is advised to use the culvert if possible.  If not possible use great caution when driving across the freeway.  Note that U-turns are prohibited.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>From the Parking area head towards Box Spring Canyon but instead of going into the canyon, follow a defined use trail up the slope on the south rim of the canyon. The trail will follow pretty close to the rim, but is not really exposed.  At a certain point the trail will fade as you transition form dirt to rock.  There are many cairns present; however, be careful if following them as not all of them will follow the approach you want.  In short, trust, but verify each cairn to ensure you are following the route you want.  There is a shortcut approach that the cairns will follow.  The writer of this beta followed them to a point then realized they were off the standard approach route and retraced steps to gain the standard route.  So this beta currently cannot vouch for the shortcut approach but does point out its existence.\n<\/p><p>If following the standard route carefully, soon after the dirt is past and the rock is reach you will want to drop down to a depression filled with dirt and scrub.  There are some use trails in the dirt here which is a good indication you are on the correct route. From here there are cairns going up an easy slab to a ridge. Descend the ridge into an obvious drainage which has another cairn marking the way.  From this point onward follow the drainage westward until a very large open slab area is encountered. The slab is step but manageable.  There are a few cairns here but you will make your way upward and to the south to an obvious weakness in the ridge.  It is a little loose but not bad.  There is no need to climb all the way up the slab and hike around the point.  \n<\/p><p>Once on top of the ridge you will have topped out.  Descend to the south keeping your eye out for a cairn that marks the easy way past a small wall.  Another large, open slab area descends to the east and drops you into the Double Arch Canyon drainage.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>There are a few small potholes and then three larger potholes are encountered.  If there is water in the first of the three big potholes then you will get wet.  The final Pothole is a swimmer when full and possibly a semi-keeper when low.  A wet suit isn't strictly necessary, but in cooler temps, if you run cold, or might be waiting for a large group it might be good to have one.  It could also be windy at times making wet people chilled.  In hot weather it is not needed though.  \n<\/p>\n<ul><li><b>R1 - 85 feet:<\/b> At the end of the last pothole is rap 1 off of a two-bolt anchor.  If the anchor wasn't present and the pothole was full there wouldn't be any options other than a water anchor here.  So the bolted anchor is a wise choice.<\/li>\n<li><b>R1 - 175 feet:<\/b> Immediately at the bottom of R1 if R2.  This is a 175 foot rap anchored with webbing slung around the leg of an arch.   To minimize rope grooving and to facilitate a better pull, walk the rope back as far as you can for the pull.  The bottom of R2 is a large box canyon with plenty of room to to get a good pull angle.<\/li><\/ul>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Double Arch Canyon, also known as Spirit Arch Canyon, is a popular hiking designation so there is a use trail an signage to follow out of it. You can take a short detour to the next box canyon south and view some petroglyphs or just follow the established trail and signage back to the parking area.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading
