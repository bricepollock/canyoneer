Like the other Transformers there is some brush, but it's not too bad and is well worth pushing through to get down the canyon. \nA Sand Trap and toggle should be sufficient unless conditions change. There are some sand filled pothole ledges that could be scoured by a large flood, possibly making a water anchor useful. I doubt that a wetsuit would ever be necessary but places can change dramatically. Maybe other canyoneers will give there opinion.\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Use the long approach for Headless Duck.
