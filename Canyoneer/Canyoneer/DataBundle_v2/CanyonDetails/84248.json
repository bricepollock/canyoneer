  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>We started to collectively refer to the drainages on the north end of\nKing Bench as the Transformer slots because in most of them, there’s\n“more than meets the eye”. Like the other Transformers there is some\nbrush, but it's not too bad and is well worth pushing through to get\ndown the canyon. A Sand Trap and toggle should be sufficient unless\nconditions change. There are some sand filled pothole ledges that could\nbe scoured by a large flood, possibly making a water anchor useful. I\ndoubt that a wetsuit would ever be necessary but places can change\ndramatically. Maybe other canyoneers will give there opinion.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>Use the long approach for Headless Duck. Carefully follow the well\ndefined path leading through the hoodoos. Careless footprints have\nnegatively impacted the \"crypto-cactus gardens\". As with other\nTransformer canyons, there are numerous interesting places to start and\nit takes a lot of exploring to find your preferred entrance. I like this\ndrainage, 37.905194, -111.251611.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>Downclimbs, tight but brief slots and a few rappels up to 18\nmeters.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n",
