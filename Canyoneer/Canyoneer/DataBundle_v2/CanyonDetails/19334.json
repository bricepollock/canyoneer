  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>Flipoff Canyon is typically used as an access route to and from Kanab\nCreek vs. being visted for its own sake - though some sections in the\nSupai rock layer are quite nice. Though the canyon is non-technical, it\ndoes have a few spots where some route-finding around dryfalls and\nthrough large boulders and also some minor class 2 scrambling is\nrequired. The approach from the rim south of Chamberlain Canyon (the\nFlipoff Route) is very steep and loose and requires a good amount of\nroute-finding to pass through the steepest sections and a few small\ncliffs safely. A few rock cairns and a faint trail do exist, but can be\ndifficult to follow - not really recommended for those without Grand\nCanyon off-trail hiking experience.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<p>The car park noted in Todd Martin's book Grand Canyoneering appears\nto be within a quarter mile of a wildlife tank - marked \"Guzzler\" on the\ntopo maps. Camping within a quater mile of a water source in Grand\nCanyon Game Preserve (and in most wilderness areas) is illegal. Parking\nappears to be legal - just not camping.</p>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><img src=\"book.png\" title=\"book.png\" alt=\"book.png\" /><a\nhref=\"http://ropewiki.com/User:Grand_Canyoneering_Book?id=Flipoff_Canyon\">Grand\nCanyoneering Book by Todd Martin</a> : Flipoff Canyon</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n",
