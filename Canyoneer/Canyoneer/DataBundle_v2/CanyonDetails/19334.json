Though the canyon is non-technical, it does have a few spots where some route-finding around dryfalls and through large boulders and also some minor class 2 scrambling is required.  The approach from the rim south of Chamberlain Canyon (the Flipoff Route) is very steep and loose and requires a good amount of route-finding to pass through the steepest sections and a few small cliffs safely.  A few rock cairns and a faint trail do exist, but can be difficult to follow - not really recommended for those without Grand Canyon off-trail hiking experience.\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Red_tape\">Red tape<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>The car park noted in Todd Martin's book Grand Canyoneering appears to be within a quarter mile of a wildlife tank  - marked \"Guzzler\" on the topo maps.  Camping within a quater mile of a water source in Grand Canyon Game Preserve (and in most wilderness areas) is illegal.  Parking appears to be legal - just not camping.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Beta_sites\">Beta sites<\/h2><\/div>\n<ul><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http:\/\/ropewiki.com\/User:Grand_Canyoneering_Book?id=Flipoff_Canyon\">Grand Canyoneering Book by Todd Martin<\/a> &#160;: Flipoff Canyon<\/li><\/ul>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Background\">Background<\/h2><\/div>\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nParsed by mw‐api‐ext.codfw.main‐6779cc57fc‐zgqh7\nCached time: 20240914191825\nCache expiry: 2592000\nReduced expiry: false\nComplications: [show‐toc]\nCPU time usage: 0.005 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.006 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 21\/1000000\nPost‐expand include size: 0\/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 0\/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 2\/100\nExpensive parser function count: 0\/500\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0\/20\nUnstrip post‐expand size: 0\/5000000 bytes\nNumber of Wikibase entities loaded: 0\/400\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%    0.000      1 -total\n-->\n<\/div>","url":"https:\/\/ropewiki.com\/Flipoff_Canyon","id":19334,"longitude":-112.6502,"timeRating":"V","waterRating":"A","version":"7be9bd9e88351cc8a9149a4d00eddddf60690fb79c71101779c8e2072efffe5e","rappelCountMin":0,"quality":2.8,"riskRating":null,"months":["Mar","Apr","May","Sep","Oct","Nov"],"vehicle":"4WD - High Clearance","geojson":null,"rappelCountMax":0,"rappelLongestMeters":null,"permit":"Yes","shuttleSeconds":null,"name":"Flipoff Canyon"}
