After this, the short walk\nfollows a fire trail towards the base of the falls. Take a right turn up\nonto a ridge which continues the top of the falls. Prepare to fight with\nstinging nettle and wait-a-while.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>The main event looks possible to be abseiled in 3 pitches with a 60m\nrope.
