  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>A beautiful walk-through canyon with many springs, waterfalls and\nvery dense vegetation for a Death Valley canyon. But extremely difficult\ndue to the intense bushwhacking required to get through it - and canyon\nwalls that don't allow easy bypass opportunities to get around the\nbushes, thorns, vines and marshes. But worth checking out for the\nadventurous minded. And many old mining ruins to see when the miners\ncame to the area decades ago - nature has taken it back now. Found a\nrecent marijuana grow patch and cache of gear &amp; tools in there.\nAppears that a flash-flood partially wrecked the operation in there.</p>\n<p>And this canyon has been used to access other side canyons\nexploration in the area.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<p>Trip dated 3-16-19:</p>\n<p><a\nhref=\"https://www.facebook.com/scott.swaney/media_set?set=a.10157164029322930&amp;type=3\">https://www.facebook.com/scott.swaney/media_set?set=a.10157164029322930&amp;type=3</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n"
