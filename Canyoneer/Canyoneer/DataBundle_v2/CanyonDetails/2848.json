Once we got to the road, a construction worker called us over and started telling us how we would get a $10,000 fine. We apologized for any inconvenience we were causing, and explained how we were following the forest order, and said we'd be happy to turn around if needed. Eventually the 'County Inspector' (I think?) showed up and talked to us. He was friendly, did not give us a $10,000 ticket but asked that we not come to this section of river for the duration of the project. \n<\/p><p>So, basically, they are doing blasting, moving heavy equipment, and don't want people on the road, or in the creek beside the road. The forest order <i>technically<\/i> doesn't prohibit moving down the creek, but it does create a problem for the SFPUC folks, and they're probably going to say something to you about it if you go. So, best idea is probably to not.\n<\/p><p>The County Inspector suggested that the work on the tunnel is likely to continue for several years.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Beta_sites_2\">Beta sites<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Trip_reports_and_media_2\">Trip reports and media<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Background_2\">Background<\/h2><\/div>\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nParsed by mw‐api‐ext.codfw.main‐6779cc57fc‐h7ggb\nCached time: 20240914191815\nCache expiry: 2592000\nReduced expiry: false\nComplications: [show‐toc]\nCPU time usage: 0.009 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.024 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 31\/1000000\nPost‐expand include size: 0\/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 0\/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 2\/100\nExpensive parser function count: 0\/500\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0\/20\nUnstrip post‐expand size: 0\/5000000 bytes\nNumber of Wikibase entities loaded: 0\/400\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%    0.000      1 -total\n-->\n<\/div>","quality":3.5,"shuttleSeconds":1800,"riskRating":null,"waterRating":"C","rappelLongestMeters":32,"months":["Aug","Sep"],"version":"0087dbc397e7cb984ce47e1ac4987a4f990783a9d268b039a6e046749cf1a4c8","geojson":{"type":"FeatureCollection","features":[{"properties":{"name":"Approach"},"geometry":{"coordinates":[[-120.01327514648438,37.824226190546604,0],[-120.01421928405762,37.82415839321614,0],[-120.01490592956543,37.823717709049966,0],[-120.01490592956543,37.823717709049966,0],[-120.0161075592041,37.8245990747509,0],[-120.01615047454834,37.824836363718155,0],[-120.01713752746582,37.8259550014299,0],[-120.01713752746582,37.8259550014299,0],[-120.01791000366211,37.82805663854743,0],[-120.01829624176025,37.828361709928274,0],[-120.0195837020874,37.828395606670526,0],[-120.0204849243164,37.82792105086222,0],[-120.02082824707031,37.827446492002004,0]],"type":"LineString"},"type":"Feature"},{"properties":{"name":"Descent"},"geometry":{"coordinates":[[-120.02084970474243,37.82729395457736,0],[-120.0225019454956,37.82651431392708,0],[-120.02391815185547,37.826497365125796,0],[-120.02460479736328,37.82687023785448,0],[-120.02842426300049,37.82610754162227,0],[-120.02842426300049,37.82610754162227,0],[-120.02926111221313,37.82542958279828,0],[-120.03033399581909,37.82537873563541,0],[-120.03033399581909,37.82537873563541,0],[-120.03050565719604,37.82568381808715,0]],"type":"LineString"},"type":"Feature"},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"coordinates":[[-120.03082752227783,37.82564992009924,0],[-120.0316858291626,37.82548042992611,0],[-120.0316858291626,37.82548042992611,0],[-120.03172874450684,37.824836363718155,0],[-120.03172874450684,37.824836363718155,0],[-120.03443241119385,37.82548042992611,0],[-120.03537654876709,37.82663295542695,0],[-120.03640651702881,37.826395672236444,0],[-120.03640651702881,37.826395672236444,0],[-120.03700733184814,37.82575161401626,0],[-120.03713607788086,37.82575161401626,0],[-120.03855228424072,37.82771766886726,0],[-120.03855228424072,37.82771766886726,0],[-120.04086971282959,37.82890405593553,0],[-120.04091262817383,37.82890405593553,0],[-120.04151344299316,37.83263257682617,0],[-120.04151344299316,37.83266647160641,0],[-120.04305839538574,37.83310710233252,0],[-120.04353046417236,37.83520853574471,0],[-120.04353046417236,37.83520853574471,0],[-120.04550457000732,37.8370387676869,0]],"type":"LineString"},"properties":{"name":"Exit"}},{"geometry":{"type":"LineString","coordinates":[[-120.04653453826904,37.838394465775565,0],[-120.04606246948242,37.83758104991225,0],[-120.04640579223633,37.83724212398858,0],[-120.04580497741699,37.836937089325836,0],[-120.04520416259766,37.837276016651025,0],[-120.04610538482666,37.83758104991225,0]]},"type":"Feature","properties":{"name":"Road"}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"name":"End Technical Section"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[[-120.03049479888915,37.82559763367757,0]]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"name":"Exit"},"geometry":{"coordinates":[[-120.04576206207275,37.837140445907785,0]],"type":"Point"}}]},"rappelCountMax":4,"rappelCountMin":1,"permit":"Closed","timeRating":"II","vehicle":"High Clearance","url":"https:\/\/ropewiki.com\/South_Fork_Tuolumne_River_(Flip_Flop)","name":"South Fork Tuolumne River (Flip Flop)","id":2848,"latitude":37.8261}
