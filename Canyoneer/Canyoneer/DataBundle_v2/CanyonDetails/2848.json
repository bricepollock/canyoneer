Once we got to the road, a construction worker called us over and started telling us how we would get a $10,000 fine. We apologized for any inconvenience we were causing, and explained how we were following the forest order, and said we'd be happy to turn around if needed. Eventually the 'County Inspector' (I think?) showed up and talked to us. He was friendly, did not give us a $10,000 ticket but asked that we not come to this section of river for the duration of the project. \n<\/p><p>So, basically, they are doing blasting, moving heavy equipment, and don't want people on the road, or in the creek beside the road. The forest order <i>technically<\/i> doesn't prohibit moving down the creek, but it does create a problem for the SFPUC folks, and they're probably going to say something to you about it if you go. So, best idea is probably to not.\n<\/p><p>The County Inspector suggested that the work on the tunnel is likely to continue for several years.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Beta_sites_2\">Beta sites<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Trip_reports_and_media_2\">Trip reports and media<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Background_2\">Background<\/h2><\/div>\n\n\n<\/div>","url":"https:\/\/ropewiki.com\/South_Fork_Tuolumne_River_(Flip_Flop)","technicalRating":3,"geojson":{"features":[{"properties":{"name":"Approach","stroke":"#00CD00"},"geometry":{"coordinates":[[-120.01327514648438,37.824226190546604,0],[-120.01421928405762,37.82415839321614,0],[-120.01490592956543,37.823717709049966,0],[-120.01490592956543,37.823717709049966,0],[-120.0161075592041,37.8245990747509,0],[-120.01615047454834,37.824836363718155,0],[-120.01713752746582,37.8259550014299,0],[-120.01713752746582,37.8259550014299,0],[-120.01791000366211,37.82805663854743,0],[-120.01829624176025,37.828361709928274,0],[-120.0195837020874,37.828395606670526,0],[-120.0204849243164,37.82792105086222,0],[-120.02082824707031,37.827446492002004,0]],"type":"LineString"},"type":"Feature"},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"name":"Descent","stroke":"#FF0000"},"geometry":{"type":"LineString","coordinates":[[-120.02084970474243,37.82729395457736,0],[-120.0225019454956,37.82651431392708,0],[-120.02391815185547,37.826497365125796,0],[-120.02460479736328,37.82687023785448,0],[-120.02842426300049,37.82610754162227,0],[-120.02842426300049,37.82610754162227,0],[-120.02926111221313,37.82542958279828,0],[-120.03033399581909,37.82537873563541,0],[-120.03033399581909,37.82537873563541,0],[-120.03050565719604,37.82568381808715,0]]}},{"geometry":{"type":"LineString","coordinates":[[-120.03082752227783,37.82564992009924,0],[-120.0316858291626,37.82548042992611,0],[-120.0316858291626,37.82548042992611,0],[-120.03172874450684,37.824836363718155,0],[-120.03172874450684,37.824836363718155,0],[-120.03443241119385,37.82548042992611,0],[-120.03537654876709,37.82663295542695,0],[-120.03640651702881,37.826395672236444,0],[-120.03640651702881,37.826395672236444,0],[-120.03700733184814,37.82575161401626,0],[-120.03713607788086,37.82575161401626,0],[-120.03855228424072,37.82771766886726,0],[-120.03855228424072,37.82771766886726,0],[-120.04086971282959,37.82890405593553,0],[-120.04091262817383,37.82890405593553,0],[-120.04151344299316,37.83263257682617,0],[-120.04151344299316,37.83266647160641,0],[-120.04305839538574,37.83310710233252,0],[-120.04353046417236,37.83520853574471,0],[-120.04353046417236,37.83520853574471,0],[-120.04550457000732,37.8370387676869,0]]},"properties":{"stroke":"#F0F000","name":"Exit"},"type":"Feature"},{"geometry":{"type":"LineString","coordinates":[[-120.04653453826904,37.838394465775565,0],[-120.04606246948242,37.83758104991225,0],[-120.04640579223633,37.83724212398858,0],[-120.04580497741699,37.836937089325836,0],[-120.04520416259766,37.837276016651025,0],[-120.04610538482666,37.83758104991225,0]]},"properties":{"stroke":"#000000","name":"Road"},"type":"Feature"},{"properties":{"name":"End Technical Section"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[[-120.03049479888915,37.82559763367757,0]]}},{"properties":{"name":"Exit"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"coordinates":[[-120.04576206207275,37.837140445907785,0]],"type":"Point"}}],"type":"FeatureCollection"},"riskRating":null,"name":"South Fork Tuolumne River (Flip Flop)","timeRating":"II","rappelCountMax":4}
