Narrow corridors, signs of mining, and great views of the river while descending this canyon. There are two forks to this canyon that can be done from the river or from the west rim. Black Jack is keeping the black range theme and if you want to play your hand right with the sun on on the approach, you will get rewarded with a short but really nice canyon. \n<\/p><p>Please, remember that installation of permanent fixed hardware is prohibited in Lake Mead National Recreation Area. No bolts.\n<\/p><p>Do not enter this canyon if you do not have the knowledge to entirely inspect and replace anchorage.

Eventually we floated down and exited from White Pocket but our trip was just getting started. We floated down to a break where you can access numerous canyons back up on the west rim.  you will be in direct sunlight while exiting the river. We exited the river, followed a local fault, and came back down Black Jack Canyon. Back at the river inflate your rafts and float down to AZ springs and out. We call this duo \"Black Jack Magic\". A 5 star day in the black range.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Red_tape\">Red tape<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>You must wear an approved USCG PFD and have a water craft suitable for floating down the river.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Beta_sites\">Beta sites<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media<\/h2><\/div>\n<p><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https:\/\/adamhaydock.blogspot.com\/2024\/01\/black-jack-canyon.html\">EVEN FURTHER BLACK JACK<\/a>\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Background\">Background<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>We found webbing in this canyon so this is not a first descent but a documented descent of an unpublished canyon. It will be great to know some more of the history behind this canyon.\n<\/p><p>This canyon was originally named Werly Canyon in 2019. Tony and Bobbie Werly are the owners of Techatticup Mine just east of Nelson Nevada, a few miles downstream at Eldorado Canyon. <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external free\" href=\"https:\/\/travelnevada.com\/ghost-town\/exploring-eldorado-canyon\/\">https:\/\/travelnevada.com\/ghost-town\/exploring-eldorado-canyon\/<\/a>. The Werlys are some of the best people I have ever met, thus we felt their name should be immortalized in this great technical descent.\n<\/p>\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nParsed by mw‐api‐ext.codfw.main‐6779cc57fc‐9w9js\nCached time: 20240914192116\nCache expiry: 2592000\nReduced expiry: false\nComplications: [show‐toc]\nCPU time usage: 0.005 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.006 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 21\/1000000\nPost‐expand include size: 0\/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 0\/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 2\/100\nExpensive parser function count: 0\/500\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0\/20\nUnstrip post‐expand size: 0\/5000000 bytes\nNumber of Wikibase entities loaded: 0\/400\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%    0.000      1 -total\n-->\n<\/div>","permit":"No","rappelCountMin":6,"latitude":35.9756,"waterRating":"A","rappelLongestMeters":36.58}
