Tony and Bobbie Werly are the owners of Techatticup Mine just east of Nelson Nevada, a few miles downstream at Eldorado Canyon. <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external free\" href=\"https:\/\/travelnevada.com\/ghost-town\/exploring-eldorado-canyon\/\">https:\/\/travelnevada.com\/ghost-town\/exploring-eldorado-canyon\/<\/a>.
