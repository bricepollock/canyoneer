Poco antes de llegar a la torre del reten de incendios, vemos a la derecha una abertura en el bosque que se dirige al barranco (no obstante, es mejor bajar por el pinar que sigue a esta abertura). Nos mantenemos en el límite del pinar, y en pocos minutos llegaremos al imponente inicio del Colorado, con unas magnificas vistas del valle del Ebro.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>El primer resalte de la cabecera se puede destrepar, pero conviene colocar una cuerda en un árbol que nos permita descender con mayor seguridad los primeros metros. Luego, con precaución ya que es un terreno muy endeble, se baja hasta el fondo del barranco. El cauce es caótico e irregular, transitando por el mismo durante unos 200 metros. Empezamos a oír el agua y superamos un par de pequeños resaltes. Las laderas se estrechan y se cubren de hayas que oscurecen el camino. Enseguida nuestra marcha se interrumpe bruscamente; vemos un salto de unos cinco metros, y después otro que se intuye más grande. Buscamos anclajes o algún lugar donde amarrar la cuerda. No hay nada. Y el conglomerado del cauce es peligroso para colocar fijaciones (tampoco hayamos ninguna). Aunque parezca fácil volver a subir este pequeño destrepe, más de uno ha bajado pero no ha podido subir; de hecho en este punto se han realizado varios rescates. Si se quiere superar la caída grande hay que utilizar los árboles, normalmente de la ladera derecha; y para llegar a ellos hay que realizar expuestas travesías, poco recomendables. La bajada es de unos 14 m desde la cabecera; y si se baja de los árboles, le sumaremos algunos metros más. La vista del salto y de los bordes de la marmita que lo recoge es espectacular. Seguidamente, surge otro resalte de otros cinco metros que se supera sin mucha dificultad. Discurrimos algo menos de 100 m y nos topamos con la última cascada, de otros 10-12 m. Ante la roca deleznable que flanquea el arroyo hay que buscar alternativas naturales para su descenso.\n<\/p>\n<div><b>Escapes:<\/b> Hasta los rápeles de 6 y 14 encadenados, se puede retroceder sin problemas.
