It sports over a dozen rappels, if you want to stay in the water all the time as the creek zig-zags its way down over many waterfalls.  The descent below is much more straight down, but often is adjacent to the watercourse.\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>From the parking pull-off 37.72443, -119.71827, head more or less straight toward R1 at 37.72366, -119.71721, instead of following the creek from directly under the bridge has a lot of brush.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Work you way down past a short staircase waterfall and a brushy sloping trough corner (DCR) until you reach a rounded slab and can see down into the valley, including Hwy 140:\n<\/p><p><b>R1: 80'<\/b> from a single bolt down the low angle slab staying DCR near the water, then hop over the water to several big trees.\n<\/p><p><b>R2: 150'?<\/b> from a big tree with webbing anchor\n<\/p><p><b>R3: 120'?<\/b> from a rock horn with webbing well DCR from the water course\n<\/p><p><b>R4: 175'<\/b> from a huge tree DCL of the water course on the next slab pour over; the \"money\" drop and banner photo\n<\/p><p><b>R5: 80'<\/b> from a pinch point with webbing, down the moderate angle slab.
