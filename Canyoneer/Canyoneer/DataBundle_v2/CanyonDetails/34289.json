  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>Bruja Canyon is one of the only canyons in Texas, and as the only\nother canyon, Cattail, remains uncompleted and extremely difficult, is\nvirtually the only canyon in Texas. Being hundreds of miles from the\nnext nearest canyons (in southern Arizona), Bruja is unique, exotic, and\none-of-a-kind. The desert ecosystem is pristine here, with plants and\nanimals not found in other canyoneering regions of the southwest. The\ncanyon is seldom known, seldom done, and seldom documented. Several\nrangers in Big Bend have never heard of it, and another ranger could\nonly comment 'I've heard people go there with ropes'. Bruja Canyon is\ndifferent, remote, and beautiful.</p>\n<p>The rainy season here is July-October. Summers are absurdly hot, even\nby SW standards, so the only wet, reasonably cool month is October.\nSpring has good weather, but the canyon could be completely dry. I\nrecommend October as the best month.</p>\n<p>Dangers abound in this canyon. Aside from the remote nature, Big Bend\nis filled which centipedes, millipedes, tarantulas, snakes, bees, wasps,\ntarantula hawks, and rope-cutting sharp rock, in quantities unseen in UT\nor AZ. At least one person in your group should be an experienced\ncanyoneer, with all members being at least solid hikers, and some\ncompetency in both rock climbing and canyoneering.</p>\n<p>Using the approach described, which is by far the shortest approach,\nrequires a class V free climb for a full pitch, for which this canyon\nreceives an R rating.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>From your car/campsite at Terlingua Abajo, follow Terlingua Creek\nnorth for fifteen minutes. Branch off NW up a wash, and follow this for\n15 minutes. Soon you will come to a plain of firm-packed silt/sand/mud\nstretching for over two miles to the mouth of Bruja. Follow this to the\ncanyon. </p>\n<p>Once near the mouth of Bruja, you will need to complete a class V\nrock climb on the SE-facing wall on the north side of the canyon. Look\ncarefully, and you will see a blue webbing anchor tied about 100 feet\nup. The first person must free climb an entire pitch of 5.0-5.2\nlimestone to the anchor. Rock shoes are not needed. If you can top-rope\na 5.7, you should be fine on this climb. If sketched out, downclimbing\nshould be easy enough. Once at the anchor, set a belay for your\npartners. </p>\n<p>After completing the rock climb, continue hacking up the hill until\nit levels out and becomes a shelf. Stay close to the rim of the canyon,\nand you will eventually find a faint trail. Follow this for 15 minutes,\ncarefully searching for the first place to downclimb into the canyon.\n</p>\n<p>When you see the first area dropping into the canyon that is not\nsheer cliff, zig-zag down the slope carefully, doing several class III\nmoves through sharp plants, until you are on the canyon floor. </p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>Once in the canyon, head down through smooth white boulders for 15\nminutes. Eventually you will come to a stunning view of a series of\nrappels and potholes in a white hallway.</p>\n<p>R1: 100 feet. Natural anchor off of two chockstones. Two stages. 30\nfeet into a pothole, cross the pothole, and another 20 feet into a\nsecond pothole.</p>\n<p>R2: 35 feet into a larger, darker pothole. Natural anchor off a small\narch. You cannot see the pothole exit from the rappel. </p>\n<p>R3: Meat anchor then downclimb over a huge boulder chockstone. If\nskinny (80 kg or less) you can downclimb a crack and go under the\nboulder. Be careful, an angry bat lives under this boulder and could\nscratch or bite.</p>\n<p>Downclimb the final slot, keep left to negotiate the house-sized\nboulders, and return to your approach route.</p>\n<p>The potholes here should never be true keeper potholes, but\nconditions change. To be safe, be sure to know how to tie your rope to\nyour bag to throw a potshot, and never pull your rappel rope until one\nmember is out of the pothole. The main pothole danger is bees. In\nseveral potholes, over 100 bees were swarming each exit, despite no\nhives being in the canyon. Lots and lots of splashing scared most away.\nDo not do this canyon if you are allergic to bees. If you insist, please\nbring an epi-pen and show your partners how to use it. We did not get\nstung, despite being in close proximity to hundreds of bees for over an\nhour in the pothole section.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>Return to your vehicle the way you came.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<p>You will probably be camping at the primitive site at Terlingua\nAbajo, for which a permit is required ($12, available at visitor centers\nin-person only).</p>\n<p>It is recommended to break this trip up over two days, hiking in on\nthe first afternoon, camping at the mouth of Bruja, and doing the canyon\nand returning to your car the next day. For this itinerary, you will\nneed a backcountry camping permit as well, also available only at the\nvisitor centers.</p>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><img src=\"rwl_en.png\" title=\"rwl_en.png\" alt=\"rwl_en.png\" /><a\nhref=\"http://summitpost.org/bruja-canyon/840739\">SummitPost.org</a> :\nBruja Canyon</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n<p>Rangers have warned against backcountry trips in Big Bend, saying the\nrock is crumbly and people have fallen and died from loose rock.\nContrary to what rangers who have never been to Bruja will state, the\nrock at Bruja is solid limestone, with literally no crumbling or loose\nstones. If you have ever canyoneered in Utah or Arizona, or hiked in the\nRockies, the rock quality here is truly superb.</p>\n",
