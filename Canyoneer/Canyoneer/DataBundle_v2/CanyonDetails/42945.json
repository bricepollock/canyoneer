The canyon does not have any sections of narrows or slot but is more of an open bowl-shaped drainage.\n<\/p>\n<ul><li>As Pussycat is within a Wilderness Area. The use of the area should remain within the bounds of the 1964 Wilderness Act.

By traversing south from the Boltergiest canyon parking area through burned trees, grass, and cactus, doing your best to dodge crypto soil. This is the longer way.\n2.By taking FS road 905 (4x4 high-clearance) to the point closest to the head of Pussycat canyon. Then traversing northeast to the actual head of the canyon.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>The drainage begins with some downclimbing, to arrive at Rappel One\n<\/p>\n<ul><li><b>Rappel 1<\/b>, can be downclimbed around on the far right or left. The drop itself drops about 70ft over multiple stages. The anchor is a medium size pine tree set back from the edge. While it would be possible to perform a pull-through rigging on the tree, to prevent the very soft rock from grooving a fiddlestick is a great tool. The sandstone found in the canyon is very soft, you could easily carve a 1\/2 groove with a single rope pull through.<\/li><\/ul>\n<ul><li><b>Rappel 2<\/b>, found soon after R1 can be bypassed on the far left (leaving the drainage). The drop itself is about 50ft and is anchored from a medium-size pine tree on the left (after a bit of downclimbing). Here again, it would be possible to perform a pull-through rigging on the tree, but to prevent the very soft rock from grooving a fiddlestick is a great tool.

Two, work your way up one of the rocky ridgelines that form the canyon's edges.
