  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>Pussycat Canyon is found inside the Cottonwood Forest Wilderness\narea. The canyon does not have any sections of narrows or slot but is\nmore of an open bowl-shaped drainage.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>As Pussycat is within a Wilderness Area. The use of the area should\nremain within the bounds of the 1964 Wilderness Act. Permanent fixed\nhardware should only be installed when necessary and power tool use is\nstrictly prohibited.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>The approach can be done in two ways. 1. By traversing south from the\nBoltergiest canyon parking area through burned trees, grass, and cactus,\ndoing your best to dodge crypto soil. This is the longer way. 2.By\ntaking FS road 905 (4x4 high-clearance) to the point closest to the head\nof Pussycat canyon. Then traversing northeast to the actual head of the\ncanyon.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>The drainage begins with some downclimbing, to arrive at Rappel\nOne</p>\n<p>Rappel #1, can be downclimbed around on the far right or left. The\ndrop itself drops about 70ft over multiple stages. The anchor is a\nmedium size pine tree set back from the edge. While it would be possible\nto perform a pull-through rigging on the tree, to prevent the very soft\nrock from grooving a fiddlestick is a great tool. The sandstone found in\nthe canyon is very soft, you could easily carve a 1/2 groove with a\nsingle rope pull through.</p>\n<p>Rappel #2, found soon after R1 can be bypassed on the far left\n(leaving the drainage). The drop itself is about 50ft and is anchored\nfrom a medium-size pine tree on the left (after a bit of downclimbing).\nHere again, it would be possible to perform a pull-through rigging on\nthe tree, but to prevent the very soft rock from grooving a fiddlestick\nis a great tool. The sandstone found in the canyon is very soft, you\ncould easily carve a 1/2 groove with a single rope pull through.</p>\n<p>Rappel #3, found after some scrambling is anchored off a large rock\npinched beneath a huge boulder, hear the top. The drop is about 80ft.\nThis rap can be bypassed with some tricky downclimbing. Here again, it\nwould be possible to perform a pull-through rigging with the anchor, but\nto prevent the very soft rock from grooving a fiddlestick is a great\ntool. The sandstone found in the canyon is very soft, you could easily\ncarve a 1/2\" groove with a single rope pull through.</p>\n<p>Rappel #4, Found after some scrambling is anchored off a single large\nboulder in a shallow pothole and drops perhaps 70ft. This drop can be\nbypassed. Here again, it would be possible to perform a pull-through\nrigging from the large boulder,but to prevent the very soft rock from\ngrooving a fiddlestick is a great tool. The sandstone found in the\ncanyon is very soft, you could easily carve a 1/2 groove with a single\nrope pull through.</p>\n<p>To arrive at the confluence of Water Canyon some downclimbing is\nrequired.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>Of the many ways to escape this canyon two options are, One retrace\nyour steps bypassing each rappel on one side or the other as is obvious.\nThis requires some 4th class climbing. Two, work your way up one of the\nrocky ridgelines that form the canyon's edges. Then return to your\nvehicle the way you came in.</p>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n",
