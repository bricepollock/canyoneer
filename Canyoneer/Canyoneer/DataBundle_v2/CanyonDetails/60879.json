Please check on local closures before planning a trip to this area. When all of the trails in the area eventually reopens, use extreme caution when descending the creek. Between landslides, fallen trees, and loose rocks, this area may be unstable and dangerous for years to come. The canyon may have changed dramatically. Do not rely on the beta below being accurate.\n<\/p><p>Spires of the Breitenbush is a small, unnamed tributary of the SF Breitenbush River in the Mount Jefferson Wilderness (not to be confused with the SF NF Breitenbush River, aka “Valhalla”, its next door neighbor to the north). The canyon features unique conglomerate formations and back to back rappels in the lower section. On a clear day, the Whitewater Creek Trail approach provides magnificent views of Mount Jefferson and the Whitewater and Russell Creek valleys. The Whitewater Trail leads to Jefferson Park, a destination in its own right on the flanks of the mountain with numerous small alpine lakes and magnificent scenery. Spires has a relatively small catchment, and likely dries up by midsummer after all the snow has melted from Jefferson Park. The scenic approach and canyon must be earned at the end of the day however, with a long and steep offtrail exit hike.\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Park at the Whitewater Creek Trailhead. Hike up the moderately graded trail 5 miles to Jefferson Park, crossing Whitewater Creek at around 3.7 miles. Work your way between the numerous alpine lakes another 1.4 miles or so to the drop in. In late spring\/early summer, you will most likely encounter large areas of snow. Too early in the season, and the snow may be difficult to navigate, or may also be present in the canyon itself. If starting early in the morning, be respectful of backpackers who may be camping at the many lakeside campsites in Jefferson Park.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>DCR = Down Canyon Right\n<\/p><p>DCL = Down Canyon Left\n<\/p><p><b>Upper Section<\/b>\n<\/p><p>The first rappel begins right away as the creek falls through a large cliffband.
