Just before the first switchback, leave the road, and continue on the normally obvious trail (38.0244, -107.6626). Climb briefly, then stay left where the trail forks. If no trail, look for a 10' tall stump or just keep wandering NE towards the cliff band. Pass through a sneak in the cliff band, and continue up several switchbacks above.
