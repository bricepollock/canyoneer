The R-rating is for the final 200-foot long narrows. Most people can squeeze through the bottom and will not warrant the R rating. Large body canyoneers will have to stem at mid-level or higher with barely more width. Final rappel has several knotchock anchor cracks available and may have a chockstone in the bottom. The Class 4 rating is for the possibility of needing to make a knotchock anchor.\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>4.5 miles ( 2 hours) mostly flat on old road.
