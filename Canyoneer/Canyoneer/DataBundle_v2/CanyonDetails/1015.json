  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>Very high pay-to-play ratio. The R-rating is for the final 200-foot\nlong narrows. Most people can squeeze through the bottom and will not\nwarrant the R rating. Large body canyoneers will have to stem at\nmid-level or higher with barely more width. Final rappel has several\nknotchock anchor cracks available and may have a chockstone in the\nbottom. The Class 4 rating is for the possibility of needing to make a\nknotchock anchor.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>4.5 miles ( 2 hours) mostly flat on old road. At end of road at the\ncliff make a sharp right turn to head due north. At drop off find the\neasiest way down. A walk down is possible if you look. At valley below\nhead further right than you think to drop in to the hallway.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>Exit down the open canyon to the first major confluence. Go right up\nthe main drainage staying left past Middle Fork and to the Moki step\nexit used for the Mindbenders.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><img src=\"rwl_en.png\" title=\"rwl_en.png\" alt=\"rwl_en.png\" /><a\nhref=\"http://ropewiki.com/User:Super_Amazing_Map?id=Sphinx_Canyon_-_Robbers_Roost\">Super\nAmazing Map</a> : Sphinx Canyon</li>\n<li><img src=\"rwl_en.png\" title=\"rwl_en.png\" alt=\"rwl_en.png\" /><a\nhref=\"http://canyoncollective.com/betabase/sphinx.70\">CanyonCollective.com</a>\n: Sphinx</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n",
