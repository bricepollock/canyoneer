The Maxon route is much more common and described here; the Mount Lukens route originally described by Chris Brennen is appreciably longer.\n<\/p>\n<ul><li><ul><li>As with all the Big T canyons your help is needed to keep access open. This entire area is still seeing a slow recovery from the old station fire which means lots of invasive plants and overgrowth in general can quickly close off access to these areas and\/or make your time in them miserable.

Cross Big Tujunga about 300 feet from the parking, and cross back over Big Tujunga within another 300 feet at 34.283579, -118.221984 .  Continue another 2000 feet on Grizzly Flat Trail where it crosses Big Tujunga again at 34.279622, -118.219445&#160;; Big Tujunga makes a sharp left bend (facing upstream) here.  Cross the creek and proceed 250 feet more to 34.279415, -118.218704 , then head off trail, straight south past 4\" rusty steel pole and a large downed tree to the ridge about 150 feet away.  Climb an animal run that angles up right onto the ridge, and follow the obvious trail is occasionally marked with white (faded from orange) flagging tape.  Climb the ridge using this trail past three sets of power poles about 800 vertical feet up to a much flatter area at 34.27435, -188.22166 .  Note that the trail does make some \"switchback\" turns on steepest parts of the ridge, so look for flagging tape and or obvious cut to plants.   Follow the tunnel in the insanely thick brush toward Suicide Canyon drop-in above the first rappel.  You may want to rappel down the super steep slope into the canyon.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>From the end of the cut trail, drop down the very steep earthen and rocky slope under thick brush to the canyon bottom between R0 and R1.  If you want to do R0, you will need to climb up from the end of the trail on the animal run and bushwhack 250 feet further up the canyon before dropping into it.  While some of the rappels in this canyon are bolted, other anchors may be destroyed in a rainstorm so the ability to construct cairn and dead man anchors is recommended for this canyon.  Use of a toggle for ghosting can come in handy too as there are many small trees, bushes and even logs that can be used.\n<\/p><p><b>R0<\/b>:&#160;???' unexplored, but looks good from a distance\n<\/p><p><b>R1<\/b>: 195' from a pair of Glue-In bolts slightly LDC (new black webbing DEC2020). \n<\/p><p><b>R2<\/b>: 57' from tree roughly in the canyon center (webbing moved higher on tree DEC2020) UPDATE: February 2020, the log in the watercourse has migrated permanently to the bottom of the rappel and is no longer available as an anchor.
