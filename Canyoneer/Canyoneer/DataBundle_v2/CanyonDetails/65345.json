  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>Yongam Falls is only really worth doing during the rainy season, but\nwhen there is plenty of water it is quite spectacular.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>Take the trail approaching Yongambong and Mansubong After 30 minutes\nof hiking from the parking, you are probably close to having gained\nenough elevation. Detour away from the trail (head left). You should be\nable to find a dry gully which enters the main stream.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>The main falls are descended in two stages. Check that the top part\nof the fall is not filled with logs in the choke point - otherwise\nretrieval is problematic. Anchors for the final part are poor. One sling\nand maillon left in-situ.</p>\n<p>No other bolts or anchors. Use trees.</p>\n<p>R30, R15, R6, R8, R9, R6</p>\n<p>(After the the stream passes under the road, there is a slide at high\nwater levels. This should be entered separately. There is a trail from\nthe main parking area)</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>Exit discreetly - it is close to a ranger station.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<p>Like all canyons in Korea - assume that you're not supposed to be\nthere.</p>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n",
