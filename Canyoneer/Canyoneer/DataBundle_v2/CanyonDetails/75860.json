  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>Bonilla canyon is among the best canyons in Costa Rica and definitely\nworld class quality. It boasts not one but two 100m waterfalls and\nseveral other high quality aquatic rappels. This canyon is prone to very\nheavy water flow and there are also multiple high consequence hand lines\nto access rappels in this canyon. It should be attempted by well\nequipped teams with ample swift water experience.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>Park your car at the bridge that crosses Rio Bonilla. You can then\nwalk next to or in the river for 10 minutes until you reach the hand\nline for R1</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>The four major waterfalls in this canyon (R1, R2, R3, and R6) are\nnamed waterfalls, which locals access via paths from the rim. All of\nthese paths are canyon left, and lead through private farmlands to the\nexit road.</p>\n<p>R1 (La Cueva): 7+30m canyon left single bolt allows a hand line to\naccess a single bolt on canyon left around the corner on the edge of the\nfalls. The recommendation is to belay your teammate out here with a rope\nthat will reach the bottom, and not to self belay due to the slickness\nof the rock in this canyon. If this canyon becomes more popular, adding\nan intermediate could be valuable for accessing the rappel 1 station. R2\n(La Morpho/La Perla): 12+43m(+ redirect) v thread high canyon left out\nof the water course provides an access rappel to the double bolt station\ncanyon left hidden behind a flake of rock in the chute. There is a\nsingle redirect bolt on canyon left at the edge to avoid the abrasion\npoint and to keep you out of the meat of the flow in high levels. It is\nrequired to cross a heavy concentration of flow to access the\nredirect.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>After R2 there is a small path canyon left that can provide escape\nfrom the canyon</li>\n</ul>\n<p>R3 (La Bruja):5+100m a double bolt station on canyon right provides a\nstation to belay your teammate out to the double bolts on R3. There is\none intermediate point on the hand line. The intermediate needs to be\nreplace as of 1 Feb 2023. We drilled holes for a v thread but dropped\nthe v thread tool during install.. Once at the double bolt, it is approx\n100m to the pool below. This rappel will drop you into the flow towards\nthe bottom.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>After R3 there is a path canyon left that leads out of the canyon\nand can also allow you to bypass the next rappel if you would like.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>R4: 10+10m bolt on canyon left provides set up for a hand line to\ncross a recirculating pool to get to another bolt canyon left to rappel\nthe short falls. Note: this rappel can be bypassed.</p>\n<p>R5: 15m there was a log jam canyon left that we used but isn’t\nguaranteed to be there in the future. The canyon is much wider in this\nsection. There is another drop after this that looks like a possible\njump and can be downclimbed around on canyon left.</p>\n<p>R6 (Las Nubes):20+100m there are bolts near the ground level on a\nflake canyon left that provide access to a bolt station over the lip of\nthe drop in the canyon center. These bolts may be difficult to find as\nthey are around some tall grass. Be mindful on this large rappel not to\nknock down the loose rock that makes up this falls. </p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>Exit canyon left through private farmlands. Be sure to ask permission\nfrom the farmers first, and offer to pay to pass through their property.\nThe community is very friendly, and members of the Turrialba Canyoning\nTeam @turrialbacanyoningteam can help connect you, and may want to run\nthe canyon with you!</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<p>All exits require travel through private farmland. Most of the\nfarmers are very welcoming and friendly, and it’s important to ask\npermission to pass through their land. Local canyoneers have\nrelationships with the farmers, and its good practice to reach out to\nthem (the Turrialba Canyoning Team @turrialbacanyoningteam) to ask for\nassistance.</p>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n<p>First opened by Luigi (Carlos Torres) and teammates from the\nTurrialba Canyoning Team</p>\n",
