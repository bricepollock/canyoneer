  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>El Mamey Canyon is a small series of waterfalls in the forest. It's\nnot really an extremely committing or long canyon, but more of two huge\nwaterfalls to rappel down to a gorgeous pool to jump and swim in. It's\nworth doing if you have a few hours in the area, but not worth detouring\nway out of your way for. This page serves to provide the beta and to\nreveal what's here to anyone interested in exploration of other canyons\nin the area.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>You'll need a high-clearance vehicle, but not 4WD, to get down the\ndirt road. Park at the curve, and kindly ask permission to park there\nfrom one of the local women.</p>\n<p>Walk down the muddy dirt road towards the stream. There are chickens,\ntrash, and toddlers running around everywhere. When the trail becomes\nmuddy at the bottom of the hill, go through the cattle gate in the\nbarbed-wire fence on your right (north). Follow the fields for a few\nminutes and descend to the stream.</p>\n<p>The stream is initially just a muddy depression. Follow the trails\nnext to it for a few minutes. It will suddenly open up with blue flowing\nwater at the top of the first waterfall.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>You should fix your ropes and plan on ascending back up this short\ncanyon. If you bring a 15m, a 25m, and a 10m, you'll have enough.</p>\n<p>The first waterfall is a 15-meter sloping rappel off a tree on the\nleft. There are no bolts or anchor, so bring your own material. This\nwaterfall appears bypassable on the right (?).</p>\n<p>There is a waist deep pool at the base.</p>\n<p>The next waterfall is large and has two options:</p>\n<p>You can rappel around 30m on the left side, or 25 meters off the\nright side (this drop is only about 15 meters, but is a total of 25\nmeters from the anchor). Both require anchoring off of a tree. No anchor\nis present, so bring your own material.</p>\n<p>If going off the right side, rappel the 25-meter drop over the\ntravertine formation. This formation is fragile, so keep your rope on\nthe edge, somewhat in the plants.</p>\n<p>After this rappel, it's immediately another rappel, about 10 meters,\ndown to a pool. There is a boulder here to tie an anchor to.</p>\n<p>The pool below is deep. You can rappel down a few meters and then\njump from the balcony, about 8 meters. Or rappel the whole drop.</p>\n<p>This pool is gorgeous, deep and refreshing. After the pool, the\nstream soon disappears into the boulders. The route's suddenly over.\nAscend back up your ropes.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>Walk back to you vehicle the way you came.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<p>No red tape. Always ask local permission. Locals say here that many\npeople come to play in different parts of the stream on hot days. No\none, it seems, goes to the waterfalls on this route, and many locals in\nthis valley have likely never seen them (?).</p>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<p><a\nhref=\"https://www.lukaseddy.com/canyons-of-the-dominican-republic\">https://www.lukaseddy.com/canyons-of-the-dominican-republic</a></p>\n<p>{{#ev:youtube|B6WDqYMSL-U}}</p>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n<p>First descent was by Suhei and Lukas Eddy in January 2022.</p>\n",
