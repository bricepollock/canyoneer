  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>Think Big!</p>\n<p>This has immense exposure, infinity pools and an immense wow factor -\nand there is even phone reception to livestream to your insta\nfollowers.</p>\n<p>There is one hanging abseil and one swim across a rockpool halfway\ndown a 50m abseil.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>Park at La Souf plateau carpark. The approach is unmarked and through\nrough terrain. Walk to the plateau, don't climb the surrounding summits.\nInstead walk to the outlet steam and use that to get through the granite\ntors. When it steepens, contour north to the open washout gully and\nfollow that to the ENE down to Skeleton Gully.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>Take 3x 60m of rope (to having everybody in the group at the hanging\nanchor at the 30m+60m double-pitch)</p>\n<p>Abseil into skeleton gully and follow the stream down, past multiple\ndownclimbs and abseils.</p>\n<p>A side stream enters (little buffalo creek) and 200m later the second\ngorge is reached. this short gorge only has two abseils.</p>\n<p>Another short walk and the massive Howells Gorge begins. Just above\nthe first 50m abseil (where the gorge drops away into nothing) there is\na rock bivy with room for about 2-3 people on the right.</p>\n<p>There are two significant drops at Howells falls. 1. Approach via a\n10m abseil on the right, with a short traverse and an anchor tucked\naround the right cliff edge. This is the abseil with a mid-waterfall\npothole that needs to be swum across. (small 6m abseil between the two)\n2. Double pitch waterfall with a semihanging anchor. The first pitch is\na smidge longer than 25m, and the second is 55m. The last 40m are right\nin the waterfall.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>Walk along the riverbanks until a small 4wd track is reached. Follow\nthis track north until you can cross the buckland river and walk to the\ncar. There a lot of freehold properties beside the track. Please avoid\ntrespassing and scaring livestock.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<p>Don't go through private property. Look up the crown land and roads\nand stick to them.</p>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<p>Skeleton and Howells v5a4III** is described in comprehensive detail\nin <a href=\"https://canyoninginvictoria.org\">Canyoning Around Victoria\nguidebook</a></p>\n<figure>\n<img src=\"Canyoning_Around_Victoria_Cover_Preview.jpeg\"\ntitle=\"Canyoning_Around_Victoria_Cover_Preview.jpeg\" width=\"100\" />\n<figcaption>Canyoning_Around_Victoria_Cover_Preview.jpeg</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n"
