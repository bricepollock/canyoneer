  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>While a little contrived, this canyon earns its stripes from the\n\"whole experience\". It's situated in a unique and interesting part of\nKosciuszko National Park that has no easy access adding to the \"whole of\ntrip\" experience. There is a ~60m drop at the end. You can walk around\nevery abseil but... then you're not canyoning.</p>\n<p>If you choose to approach via one of the creek lines be warned none\nof them are easy or quick with a LOT of boulder scrambling. Some people\naccess the area via Lady Northcote Aqueduct (a.k.a. Siren Song Tunnel)\nbut this is Snowy Hydro infrastructure and not permitted.</p>\n<p>It is recommended to do this as a two day trip and camp at <a\nhref=\"https://www.khuts.org/index.php/huts/kosciuszko-national-park/opera-house\">Opera\nHouse Hut</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>There are a lot of ways to access Lady Northcote over land and we're\nnot going to prescribe any particular route. Finding a route in/out for\nthis canyon is part of the challenge/experience.</p>\n<p>Many of creeks have been descended/ascended (Lady Northcote Creek,\nJames McArthur Creek, Strezelecki Creek, Crags Creek) and the Opera\nHouse Hut log book is full or reports about how difficult (lots of\nboulder scrambling) and slow going all of them are.</p>\n<p>Some people choose to approach via the the 2.25km long Lady Northcote\nAqueduct (a.k.a. Siren Song Tunnel) however this is Snowy Hydro\ninfrastructure and not permitted or without risk. It's an aqueduct with\nactual water running through it!</p>\n<figure>\n<img src=\"Lady_northcote_tunnel.jpg\"\ntitle=\"The view inside Lady Northcote Aqueduct - photo sourced from Snowy Hydro Facebook page\"\nwidth=\"500\" />\n<figcaption>The view inside Lady Northcote Aqueduct - photo sourced from\nSnowy Hydro Facebook page</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>The view inside Lady Northcote Aqueduct - photo sourced from Snowy\nHydro Facebook page</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>Proceed down canyon referring to the Lady Northcote Canyon v4a2II*\ncanyon topo for details on problems* you will encounter along the\ncanyon</p>\n<figure>\n<embed src=\"Lady_Northcote_v4a2II.pdf\"\ntitle=\"Lady_Northcote_v4a2II.pdf\" />\n<figcaption>Lady_Northcote_v4a2II.pdf</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p><small>*A \"problem\" is a notable geographical feature that prevents\nyour progression through the canyon. Often engaging with a problem is\nmandatory (e.g. an abseil in a slot canyon where no alternate route\nexists), but occasionally they are optional and can be bypassed via an\nalternate route in the canyon.</small></p>\n<p>If you notice any inaccuracies with the canyon topo please contact\nthe author.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>After the last problem (~60m waterfall) walk downstream to the\njunction of Lady Northcote Creek and Strzelecki Creek</li>\n<li>Walk up Strzelecki Creek for about 400m until you reach the Opera\nHouse Hut access road</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Lady Nortcote Aqueduct is <a\nhref=\"https://www.snowyhydro.com.au\">Snowy Hydro</a> infrastructure and\naccess by unauthorised persons in not permitted</li>\n<li>Completing a NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service <a\nhref=\"https://www.nationalparks.nsw.gov.au/trip-intention-form\">trip\nintention form</a> is highly recommended</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a\nhref=\"https://www.khuts.org/index.php/huts/kosciuszko-national-park/opera-house\">https://www.khuts.org/index.php/huts/kosciuszko-national-park/opera-house</a></li>\n<li><a\nhref=\"https://www.adventureswithm.com/2001/04/16/lady-northcotes-sirens-song-they-sounded-so-benign/\">https://www.adventureswithm.com/2001/04/16/lady-northcotes-sirens-song-they-sounded-so-benign/</a></li>\n<li><a\nhref=\"https://www.ski.com.au/xf/threads/lady-northcote-canyon-falls.25923/\">https://www.ski.com.au/xf/threads/lady-northcote-canyon-falls.25923/</a></li>\n<li><a\nhref=\"https://www.mickeymichelle.com/blog/opera-house-mt-kosciuszko-by-mickey\">https://www.mickeymichelle.com/blog/opera-house-mt-kosciuszko-by-mickey</a></li>\n<li><a\nhref=\"https://www.subw.org.au/2008/01/05/lady-northcotes-canyon/\">https://www.subw.org.au/2008/01/05/lady-northcotes-canyon/</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n"
