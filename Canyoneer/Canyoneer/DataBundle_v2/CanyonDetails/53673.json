This route is a good option for the experienced group if you are looking for a dry canyon that does not require a permit in the Zion area. \n<\/p><p>Dothraki is not to be underestimated! This is a challenging canyon for someone not used to stemming and tough downclimbs.\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Two options here, both seem to take the same amount of time; around 3hrs to 1st anchor. \n<\/p><p><b>The Dragon's Back Approach <i>(no shuttle)<\/i> <\/b>\n<\/p><p>This is the original approach that starts from Squirrel Canyon trailhead and does not require a car shuttle.  Despite being the original approach route, this is fast become less recommended due to it being quite miserable. This approach has about 600 feet of elevation gain up semi-steep, sandy road and use trails to the cliff band.  The route then follows up a ravine through the cliff band gaining an additional 450 feet with a few sections of very steep sand and loose rock. Take your time while navigating this section. Once at the top of the ravine you will be on a ridge known locally as the Dragon's Back which you then scramble and walk all the way up to the head of the canyon with great views over the area. The route up the ravine to the Dragon's Back has a couple of portions that are difficult to describe in words. Be ready to do a little route finding in a couple short sections. \n<\/p><p><b>Water Canyon Approach <i>(10min shuttle)<\/i> <\/b>\n<\/p><p>Despite more mileage, this approach is said to be easier than the Dragon's Back approach since the terrain is less difficult and aggressive. Park a recovery vehicle at Squirrel Canyon trailhead--which will be the exit trailhead--and shuttle to Water Canyon trailhead. Follow the very obvious, well used, Water Canyon trail up to Top Rock and then begin cross-country travel across mostly open desert with a few easy grades.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<ul><li><b>R1:<\/b> 85' Anchored from a tree LDC.
