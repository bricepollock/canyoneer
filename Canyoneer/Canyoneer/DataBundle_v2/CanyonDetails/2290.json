Expect colorful rock formations, spires, and bizarrely sculpted rock that's like something out of the Desert Southwest. Can be done as a day hike or as part of a longer backpack route down to the Owyhee Reservoir.\n<\/p>\n<ul><li>Roads to the trailhead can be impassable when wet. High clearance recommended.<\/li>\n<li>There are some minor obstacles in upper Painted Canyon requiring some scrambling. When faced with an obstacle, either downclimb or look for a bypass trail.<\/li>\n<li>Painted Canyon can be subject to flashfloods - presumably after heavy rainstorms.<\/li><\/ul>\n<meta
