The canyon was descended several dry months after it completely burned in a fire. The anchors have to deal with completely cooked soil, dead trees, and lots of loose everything. It has a great feel to it, as it is completely devoid of life and moisture. It is as dead as they get, like a Death Valley canyon after a bombing run.\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Park at the parking lot just south and west of the ranger station at the base of Route 39. From here, you can see the canyon and identify the ridge you'll want to hike up to its right. Hike up the bike path next to R39 until you can find a way down and across the wash.\n<\/p><p>Pick the easiest looking ridge to the right of the canyon, and hike up. It's loose and frustrating at times, but it ends. You'll then hike up gentler slopes along the ridge. The trail steepens before reaching the summit of this small peak. Descend left\/south and find whatever you're happy with scrambling down into the canyon. It's a bit tricky in some spots.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>The descent winds down a relatively narrow canyon without any major obstacles aside from the 4 or so rappels.
