class=\"mw-content-ltr mw-parser-output\" lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><p>Indie-Rock is a minor tributary of the more well-known Rock Creek.  It enters downstream of Rock Creek's technical section.  It runs low most of the year, so might be a good outing early in the season or for beginners.  Don't bother with this one in mid-summer.  The upper creek is a bit overgrown, but it soon subsides in a series of long chunky bedrock ramps that can, mostly, be downclimbed.  These are mixed with occasional debris piles to climb over.  There's a long hike out along Rock Creek making this one a high pay-to-play.\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Directions\">Directions<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>From the Bridge of the Gods, turn right on Hwy 14 and continue 1.5mi east to turn off left\/north towards Skamania Lodge on Rock Creek Dr.  Turn left again in 0.3mi onto SW Foster Creek Rd.  Continue 0.4mi and continue straight onto SW Ryan Allen Rd for another 0.5mi before turning left again onto Red Bluff Rd (becomes gravel).  Follow Red Bluff Rd for 5.7mi to a bridge across Rock Creek.  Continue west on Red Bluff Rd for 1.5mi to a junction where the main road swings left to cross a second bridge over Rock Creek.  (This is probably the best checkpoint for flow on the creek.)  About 0.8mi past the second bridge on Red Bluff Rd to reach an unsigned junction (Jct 1380). Here, turn right on an unnamed gravel road for 0.5mi. On driving up the hill watch for the place where the PCT crosses. This is the exit.  The parking area is 200ft further up the road; a large pullout on the left with room for several vehicles. Road is rocky in places, but okay for 2WD if driven slowly.\n<\/p>\n<ul><li>A Washington State Discovery Pass is NOT required to park here.<\/li>\n<li>This is also the trailhead for the <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http:\/\/ropewiki.com\/Rock_Creek_(Upper_North_Fork)\">Upper North Fork of Rock Creek<\/a>.<\/li><\/ul>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>From the lower parking area, either walk or shuttle 1mi further up the road to a turnaround in an old clearcut. There are a number of unsigned junctions, so having a map is handy.\n<\/p><p>There is no trail from the turnaround. Just bushwhack your way uphill to the northwest for about 0.1mi (150ft elevation gain) wherever is easiest to meet the old Snag Creek trail. Not that USGS maps are not accurate in showing the location of the trail. It actually runs atop the ridgecrest and is obvious when you find it. As of 2017 it was obvious that someone had done recent maintenance on it. Follow the trail left \/ northwest for perhaps a mile. The trail switchbacks up onto the plateau, gaining about 600ft, before flattening out and becoming easy hiking. Pass a large signboard where you pass from DNR land to National Forest.  On crossing an obvious drainage, head downstream into Indie-Rock.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<ul><li>Downclimb 15ft.<\/li>\n<li>First long low-angle bedrock ramp.

Anchored on a tree well back from the top. Slightly overhung at the bottom.<\/li>\n<li>\"Waterslide Alley\". Very long bedrock ramp with multiple short drops. Downclimb or rappel. Going for a tumble would be bad. Goes on and on.<\/li>\n<li>R2: 50ft, but uses perhaps 140ft of rope (single strand) given where the anchor is located: high up on a tree atop the ridge DCR to run the flow direct. This allowed for a fun rappel and nice clean pull of the rope afterwards.  There is an interesting pinnacle just above the falls.<\/li>\n<li>R3: 50ft. The water spreads out over the lip of the falls meaning there is a lot of plant life making for a thrashy rappel. Far left might have a better line. Land on a ledge near the bottom and thrash down the rest of the way DCR.<\/li><\/ul>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>(Note: This is the same exit as Rock Creek; just a tad shorter. Note that water levels will quadruple or more on entering Rock Creek.)\n<\/p><p>Below the last falls it's about 2mi hike downstream to the PCT footbridge. Expect it to take a couple of hours. This is not your average streamwalk as there are numerous sections of narrows, bedrock, giant boulder gardens, and a couple of logjam obstacles to keep you busy. You will pass the Post-Rock tributary on the way out.\n<\/p><p>Logjam #1: Climb under a giant old-growth log DCR, then up on top of it. Use it as a ramp to do a descending traverse to the DCL side of the falls and drop into a pool. Swimmer.\nLogjam #2: Bear DCR to find an easy way way to hike through the jam. This one is relatively close to the footbridge.\nWhen you see an obvious blue-green cliff DCL, you are approaching the end. Upon reaching the footbridge, easiest exit from the creek up to the bridge is DCL.\n<\/p><p>Follow the PCT northwards 0.7mi back to your car.  It's relatively, but not entirely, flat on the way out.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Red_tape\">Red tape<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>None.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Beta_sites\">Beta sites<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Background\">Background<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Kevin Clark and Keith Langenwalter first descended Indie-Rock in 2019.\n<\/p>\n\n\n<\/div>","name":"Rock Creek (Indie, South Cascades)"}
