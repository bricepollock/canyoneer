  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>The approach is long (3 hours at a moderate pace) and involves some\nbushwhacking. The canyon itself is 800 lateral feet and drops about 800\nfeet in elevation. Like many Zion canyons, it is not all that technical,\nbut does provide spectacular views of The Narrows and Zion in general. A\nfine tour. In addition to two long rappels (&gt;250 feet), there is a\nnice, moderate downclimbing section in the middle. The free-hanging drop\ninto the Narrows is the best of the three usual suspects (Imlay,\nMystery, Not Imlay). Worth the effort. Good for summer as most of the\nroute is in the shade, with the exception of the first two rappels, and\nthe river walk will cool you off even on a 100 degree day. No wetsuit\nrequired, even after rain.</p>\n<p>Due to the long rappels, this is not a good canyon for beginners.\nSeveral coreshots can be attributed to beginners not rigging for a\nsmooth descent on the last rappel. Conveniently, the coreshot will be in\nthe middle of your rope.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>Use the right-hand Sneak Route towards Imlay, but cut right after the\nfirst pass. An early start in summer is helpful.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p><strong>R1: WARNING: The originally published line of descent rapped\nabout 80 feet to the side of the watercourse to a sandy, steeply-sloped,\nunpleasant ledge, and then from a tree through trees back into the\nwatercourse. More recently, the 300 foot rappel next to the watercourse\nhas become popular. Be sure you are clear on which of these you are\ndoing. Lack of clarity on this issue resulted in a fatal accident\nOctober of 2015.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>There is important beta to understand about this canyon - be\nsure to read up-to-date sources.</strong></p>\n<p>First rappel: be sure to extend the webbing as far as you can. Be\nsure to bring a 40' piece of webbing to rig this rappel, if it is not in\nplace or is chewed up. Following the center of the watercourse takes you\nto a roomy and sandy ledge with 6\" tree as intermediate anchor, which\ncan be used to break R1 into 2 rappels approximately 200 and 100\nfeet.</p>\n<p>In the middle V trough canyon section, several short rappels are\ndown-climbable at a moderate level. There are 2 downclimbs that are\nspicy and usually rappelled, one anchored from a big rock at the top of\nthe V trough in a sandy-bottom alcove, and one from a bolt LDC hidden\nfrom view.</p>\n<p>Last rappel: it is important to manage your ropes well to not impact\nhikers below in The Narrows. About halfway down the rappel, the landing\nzone can be seen, and the ropebag can be dropped from there. The rap\ngoes free at this point. Many people have coreshot ropes on this rappel,\nmostly at the point where it goes free, so rig carefully. Change the\nabrasion point on the rope after each person rappels. With the anchor\nwell extended for reasonable pull, the drop is 240 feet with about 140\nfeet free. Rigged at the giant boulder pinch point, the final rappel is\nmore like 260 feet, but the pull would be nearly impossible.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>Hike out The Narrows about 20 minutes to the trail.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<p>A permit is required for this canyon. Group size limit is 6; daily\nquota is most likely 12. Not particularly competitive.</p>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><img src=\"rwl_en.png\" title=\"rwl_en.png\" alt=\"rwl_en.png\" /><a\nhref=\"http://bluugnome.com/cyn_route/zion/zion_not-imlay/zion_not-imlay.aspx\">http://bluugnome.com/cyn_route/zion/zion_not-imlay/zion_not-imlay.aspx</a>\nBluuGnome.com : Not Imlay Canyon (not up to date)</li>\n<li><img src=\"rwl_en.png\" title=\"rwl_en.png\" alt=\"rwl_en.png\" /><a\nhref=\"http://ropewiki.com/User:Super_Amazing_Map?id=Not_Imlay_-_Zion_Area\">Super\nAmazing Map</a> : Not Imlay</li>\n<li><img src=\"rwl_en.png\" title=\"rwl_en.png\" alt=\"rwl_en.png\" /><a\nhref=\"http://canyoneeringusa.com/utah/zion/technical/not-imlay\">CanyoneeringUSA.com</a>\n: Not Imlay</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<p>5/30/2015 There is a new anchor where you can rap straight down the\nwall in rap 1. It's a great rap and the 300' rope you have for the last\nrap will work well. You can rap all the way down to the second rap if\nyou have enough rope for a pull side but we were not sure so we set up a\nsecond anchor on a small tree. (comment: the rap is 300' IF the anchor\nat the top extends down the slab a long way). The last rap is definitely\nlonger than 230' it is way more like 260 maybe even 280. We had to lower\nsomeone 8' as he threw 260' of rope and it was short! Beautiful\nCanyon.</p>\n<p>9/26/2017 <a\nhref=\"http://adamhaydock.blogspot.com/2017/09/not-imlay-canyon-zion-national-park-utah.html\">http://adamhaydock.blogspot.com/2017/09/not-imlay-canyon-zion-national-park-utah.html</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n<p><a\nhref=\"http://www.bogley.com/forum/showthread.php?74884-Zion-Accident-Louis-Johnson-Not-Imlay-Canyon\">Bogley\nthread on October 2015 fatality</a></p>\n",
