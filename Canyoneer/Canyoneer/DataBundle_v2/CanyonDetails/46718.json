The rugged terrain and untouched beauty of this untamed landscape serve as a testament to nature's resilience and the intricate layers of human history interwoven into its fabric. This wilderness, where the modern world fades away, invites exploration into the remnants of a bygone era, revealing the rich tapestry of human habitation spanning thousands of years. From the thriving Native American communities predating European arrival to the 19th-century miners drawn by the allure of mineral wealth, each chapter has left its mark, manifesting in rusting equipment and dilapidated structures. The Spanish influence further enriches the narrative, as explorers and missionaries intermingle with the indigenous peoples, creating a complex cultural tapestry. The remote wilderness becomes a living museum, inviting reflection on the interconnected history of its inhabitants. This sacred land transcends its physical realm, becoming a refuge where the echoes of the past linger and softly share their stories with those open to listening.\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Red_tape\">Red tape<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Beta_sites\">Beta sites<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Background\">Background<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>The canyon's name, bestowed in honor of Matt Maxon, pays tribute to his profound contributions and exploration of nature.<br \/>\nFirst Descent by Ron Lebfrom and Mark Crawford<br \/>\n{{#ev:vimeo|216517450}}<br \/>\nSecond Descent Drone footage by Ron Lebfrom Solo<br \/>\n{{#ev:vimeo|217776434}}<br \/>\n<\/p>\n\n\n<\/div>","version":"b1f704cfa3a86636bc1dae2b3ee394cca79fd880d643e640370a3162719526b7","months":["Dec","Jan","Feb","Mar","Apr","May","Sep","Oct","Nov"],"shuttleSeconds":null}
