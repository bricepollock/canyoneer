  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>Hardly accessible, this canyon is probably best to do with an\novernight just before the start of the canyon (but already after\nabseiling 500m onto a grass band). However, you will be rewarded with a\nslot canyon, sometimes less than 1m wide, and a big finish !</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>Find your way to Augstgumm, where the first descenders have made a\nrappel line down to a grass band. Once this is crossed, you are already\nat the start of the canyon. Easy, it's just 8hours of efforts up to this\npoint.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>Pretty much all the canyon is very narrow, just the last 150m\nWaterfall opens up towards the Urbach valley.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>Now comes the hard part, being able to walk 5min to get back to the\ncar after all this time hanging on your ropes.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<p><a\nhref=\"https://www.descente-canyon.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=16&amp;t=19136\">https://www.descente-canyon.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=16&amp;t=19136</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<p>Picture credit : Matthias Holzinger</p>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n",
