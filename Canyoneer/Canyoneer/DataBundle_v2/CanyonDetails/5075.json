  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>Basin Creek is a good quality, short side canyon that enters the NF\nKings about halfway from Balch Camp to the powerhouse that makes a great\nalternative to the high-flow canyons often found in the Sierra\nMountains. The route is primarily a series of rappels next to low\nflowing waterfalls. The creek has a very small drainage, so flows will\nseldom be large enough to cause problems and suitable for year-round\nenjoyment. The total hiking distance from road to road is about 1/2\nmile. This a mostly bolted canyon featuring several large,\nstraight-forward rappels, 1 minor downclimbing obstacle, and 1 optional\ntraverse; making it a fairly beginner friendly canyon. Poison oak is\npresent in and around the canyon.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>As you drive up the Black Rock Road from Balch Camp, the road crosses\nan exciting cliff face with a couple of bridges to span short chasms.\nWhen the road leaves that cliff face, it enters the small Basin Creek\ndrainage. There is a turnout near where the creek plunges down the\ncliff. The hillside below this turnout is less bushy than other areas,\nallowing an easy approach to the creek. The creek is very close at this\npoint. Head south and follow the path of least resistance to the first\nrappel on bolted anchors DCR. Little to no bushwhacking is required.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>R1: 2 bolts DCR 70' into a shallow pool. </p>\n<p>R2: Large boulder, 25'</p>\n<p>5' Downclimb</p>\n<p>R3: 2 bolts DCL 150'. There is a ledge 100' down with deadman anchor\noptions so it is possible to do the rappel in 2 stages. </p>\n<p>R4: 2 bolts DCL 115'. </p>\n<p>R5: 2 bolts DCR 140'. There is another set of bolts DCC requiring an\neasy but exposed traverse to reach. The DCC anchor allows for a better\nposition to exit the canyon. </p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>The canyon can be done as a loop or car shuttle. If shuttling, a\nriver crossing on exit is required which may require swimming or be\nimpassible at times. The loop exit consists of an easy scramble up a\ntalus field.</p>\n<p>Shuttle: After R5, continue downstream. There is an additional ~8'\ndown climb and R6 50' from 2 bolts DCC. This route ends on the Balch\nPowerhouse road, about halfway between Balch Camp and the powerhouse. As\nyou drive up the road to the powerhouse you will see a flat terrace\nbelow the road. There is a ramp from the road down to the terrace and a\nfurther ramp leading down close to the river. This provides easy access\nfrom the river back up to the road. Basin Creek enters the river about\n100 yards upstream of this ramp. Hiking from Basin Creek along the NF\nKings, across the NF Kings and then up to the road is pretty easy most\nof the year. Do not attempt this route if there is high flow in the NF\nas it could be impossible to cross. High flows on the NF only occur when\nBalch afterbay dam spills in the spring of wet years and periodically in\nJanuary during maintenance operations.</p>\n<p>Loop: After R5, head up the slope DCR following one of the several\ngame trails. Continue up and around to the right, skirting the class 3\nscramble to access the talus slope in the gully. From here it is an easy\nscramble up, however, be mindful of loose rock. As you approach the road\nand the top of the gully, look for a trail UCR that leads to the turnout\nwhere you left your car.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<p>As you drive up the road to the powerhouse you will see a flat\nterrace below the road. There is a ramp from the road down to the\nterrace and a further ramp leading down close to the river. This\nprovides easy access from the river back up to the road. Basin Creek\nenters the river about 100 yards upstream of this ramp. In the winter\nthere is a pretty and impressive 3 or 4 step waterfall down Basin creek\nvisible from the road. The horizontal distance from Black Rock Road to\nthe Balch Powerhouse Road is about 1/4, while the drop is 900 feet. We\nhad 6 rappels, with 5 bolted stations and one slung chockstone on a very\nshort rappel or downclimb. The longest rap was about 40 meters, while\nmost were in the 30 to 35 meter range. (We had a 70 meter rope, hence my\nuse of meters) There is a bit of bushwacking at the start of the trip\nand near the end which could have been easily alleviated if I had\nbrought the pruning shears that I intended to bring. There is also a\nfair bit of poison oak in the canyon which can be mostly avoided with\ncare. On the last rappel of the main waterfall, the rope fell into\npoison oak when we pulled it, so I intend to move those anchors when I\ngo back.</p>\n<p>We took 4 hours on the first descent of Basin Creek, so subsequent\ntrips by a competent group could be done in a couple hours. It will also\nbe decent winter trip as it faces south and is fully exposed to the\nsun.</p>\n<p>Information on this canyon was extracted from an email Paul Martzen\nsent to some friends on Jun 2013, reproduced here with permission from\nthe author.</p>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n<p>Original canyon beta from an email by Paul Martzen, updated by a\nsecond descent done by Amanda C.</p>\n",
