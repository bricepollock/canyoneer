class=\"mw-content-ltr mw-parser-output\" lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><p>If you're a fan of San Gabriel Mountain canyons, and you like a long walk, then this canyon is for you.  It has gorgeous rugged narrows sections, rock-hopping for miles, a couple of unavoidable swims through crystal clear water, some opportunities for jumping and sliding, and four top-notch waterfall rappels.  Don't underestimate the commitment though; including the approach you're in for a pretty long day.  Also, don't underestimate the water flow as it can easily be class C.\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Take icehouse saddle trail, then head towards Coucamonga peak, which, if you haven't had a chance to get up there, has a pretty epic view.  The drop in to the canyon is at a beautiful, obvious windy saddle between Coucamonga and the Ontario\/Bighorn ridge.  If you notice you're going uphill again, you've gone too far.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>After descending the non-technical upper section from the Cucamonga Saddle you will reach a sharp S bend in the canyon at 34.20489, -117.61202.  There is a deep saddle about 20 feet above the canyon floor RDC which connects to the other side of this S bend. Right after this is where things get fun!\n<\/p><p><b>R0 25 feet \/ downclimb 2x 10 feet:<\/b>  rig a rappel there or in the water course LDC \/ or 2 down-climbs directly against canyon wall right \n<\/p><p><b>S1 20 feet:<\/b> low angle slide with a 2 foot drop right at the start, R1 immediately follows  \n<\/p><p><b>R1 65 feet:<\/b> Upper Cucamonga Falls, money rappel #1, Rig off a large tree DCL directly into the water at the lip, and down 50 feet of moss covered drop into a waist deep pool.\n<\/p><p><b>Note:<\/b> scree field DCL can be used to climb up to rock ledges and back to a chute, rappel chute to get back to the R1 top.

The rappel itself can be done nearly dry by using a 1 slot DCR to hold your rope from angling into the waterfall itself.  In high flow this make it easy to rappel with packs on into the waist deep pool.\n<\/p><p>Continue another approx 2 miles to the access road.  You cannot miss the exit, because the creek goes through a steel culvert pipe.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>The access road has been closed for a while due to the closure of Lower Cucamongo Canyon, so instead of having a car at the bottom of the canyon like in Brennen's day, you have to walk a couple of miles over open dirt and paved road to the neighborhood below.  This moves the shuttle car drop point to somewhere around 34.165075, -117.628966, but you cannot park a vehicle here; see Red Tape below.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Red_tape\">Red tape<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>A parking permit is now required to park at the bottom of Cucamonga Canyon. It is free for residents of Rancho Cucamongas, who must first register their vehicle, and $20 per day for visitors. Permits are limited, first come first serve, and allow parking along Almond Street. More information and a link to purchase a permit can be found at the <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https:\/\/www.permitsales.com\/rancho\/\">Rancho Cucamongo Paid Parking Program<\/a> website.  Parking is free if you park sufficiently far away into the neighborhood, adding an additional 1\/2 mile to the hike, just look for the absence of \"Parking by Permit Only\" signs.\n<\/p><p>Stay on Big Tree Cucamonga Road while exiting to avoid the closure area, which is West of the road.
