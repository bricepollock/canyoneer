Over the next 200 feet or so the walls will get more and more narrow until larger people can no longer fit between the walls. When the canyon gets very narrow larger people will want to stem up continue down canyon by stemming / galumphing. Small people who enjoy thrashing around in deep skinny slots can push forward. Low is very tight and skinny in places. If you went high; stemming / galumphing is easy with a few semi wide silo like spots to go over that are also easy. If you went low; travel on the canyon floor is work as you try to squeeze between the walls and make your way around awkward sculpted features in the walls. (Data by bluugnome.com)"
