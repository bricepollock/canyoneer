It's best to park your car in the parking lot you hit ~2 minutes later (before the bridge), but you can also park along the side of the road after the bridge near the start of the Sutton Mine Trial and walk the Sutton Mine Trial towards the start of the VF. \n<\/p><p>The route is varied with sections of narrow rock ledge, rungs across blank rock sections, climbing and descending sections and cable traverses – with the entire route protected by continuous safety cable.\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Walk up the road from the parking lot.
