  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>Eagle Creek is a major tributary of the Columbia River. Although a\npopular hiking trail is located no more than a few hundred feet away\nfrom the creek at all times, the large volume of water and inability to\nreach the trail from the watercourse present some unusual risks. This is\none of the best canyon destinations in the Columbia River Gorge. Eagle\nis best visited later in the summer when the water levels are lower.</p>\n<p>Eagle Creek has several options: you could run the upper section, the\nlower, or both. Lower Eagle is arguably the best part of the canyon and\ncan be completed in a half-day.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Please read the \"Red Tape\" section below before visiting this\ncanyon.</li>\n<li>Use caution when descending the creek. Post-wildfire hazards such as\nlandslides, fallen trees, and loose rock may persist for many years to\ncome.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"water_flow\">Water Flow</h3>\n<p>Eagle Creek has a large watershed (~27mi^2) and retains good water\nwell into late summer. Expect a lot of swimming.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Prior to entering any hydraulics, always have a person ready with a\nthrow rope, and be sure there are no obstructions blocking the exit.\nExpect to be tossed and turned in some of them. In late summer, the\nhydraulic threat reduces considerably and may disappear completely.\nThose at the bottom of the waterfalls are easily avoided.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Jumping is a leading cause of canyon injury (broken ankles and\nlegs). Always send someone down first to check the depth and look for\nsubmerged obstacles. Please do NOT jump Punchbowl Falls (see \"Red Tape\"\nbelow).</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<h3 id=\"directions\">Directions</h3>\n<p>From Portland, take I-84 east to exit 41. Turn right off of the exit\nand park in the lot immediately past the fish hatchery on the left. This\nis the recommended parking area. (The actual Eagle Creek trailhead is\n0.5mi further down the road, but that trailhead is renowned for car\nbreak-ins. You've been warned!) Arrive early for parking.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The trailhead is only accessible from I-84 eastbound.</li>\n<li>Leave nothing of value - and nothing that looks like it could be\nvaluable (ex: visible bags, purses, rope bags) - in your vehicle. Keep\nstuff in your trunk and out of sight.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"lower_eagle\">Lower Eagle</h2>\n<p>Walk the road (flat) for 0.5mi to the actual Eagle Creek trailhead,\nthen continue ~2.1mi to drop in just above Punchbowl Falls (approx.\n45.62087, -121.89252). Descend off-trail down a mossy talus field\n(there's a bit of an old trail, but it's hard to recognize. We typically\nhandline or rappel from a convenient tree about 8ft down into the\ncreek.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Beware poison oak along the Eagle Creek trail. There's quite a bit\nof it.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"upper_eagle\">Upper Eagle</h3>\n<p>To run the upper section of the canyon, continue on another mile to\nHigh Bridge where the trail crosses a narrow chasm to the west side of\nthe creek. Continue 0.3mi further along the trail. Just above\nSkoonichuck Falls, locate an old campsite on the left side of the trail.\nA use trail leads from the campsite down to the creek just above the\nfalls.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<h3 id=\"upper_eagle_1\">Upper Eagle</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>R1 - Skoonichuk Falls</strong>: 120ft from a cairn DCR. The\nline of the rappel keeps you mostly out of the flow and hydraulics.\nAlthough the vertical drop is only about 50ft, the waterfall has two\ntiers and additional rope is required for the horizontal distance. The\nsecond tier can be jumped in the right conditions. It's recommended to\nextend the pull side ahead of time; this allows for an easy pull from\nthe far side of the pool. In high flow, rappel from a tree DCL at the\ncampsite to avoid the hydraulics.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Hydraulic #1</strong>: This hydraulic is just before the\nHigh Bridge narrows. Stay DCL and slide into the hydraulic. A person\nwith a throw rope can be situated on a ledge DCL.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The canyon makes a sharp left turn as it exits the narrow slot and\nLoowit Falls appears on the left.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Hydraulic #2:</strong> Slide or jump into the hydraulic. A\nperson with a throw rope can be situated at the exit lip of the pool. In\nhigh flow, the recirculating current is noticeably stronger at the exit\nwhere you'll need to climb out.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Hydraulic #3:</strong> This hydraulic looks the tamest, but\nproceed with caution, especially if entering the center. In high-extreme\nflow, seven people who entered were unable to escape and required a\nthrow-rope. A person with a throw rope can be situated on a ledge DCR.\nTo avoid the hydraulic, slide/hug the wall DCR.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Just past hydraulic #3 the canyon walls start to open up. In 2023,\nthere was a big logjam here. Climb up the middle and find a way to\ndownclimb on the DCR side.</p>\n<p>At this point, you have two choices:</p>\n<p>1) Recommended: exit the creek at about 45.61102, -121.88546, and\nbushwhack up to the trail. There's some thick vegetation at the start\nwith open talus above. The trail is about 60 vertical feet above. Hike\nabout 0.9mi downstream and drop into Lower Eagle as described above.</p>\n<p>2) Or, if in need of punishment, continue down the creek to Lower\nEagle. It's a long creek slog.</p>\n<h3 id=\"lower_eagle_1\">Lower Eagle</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>J1</strong>: 12ft from DCR into a deep pool. This is a sign\nyou are nearing Punchbowl Falls.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Just ahead is another short drop into a pool with a waterfall (Tish\nCreek) entering DCR. Entering this pool may commit you to going over the\nfalls. It might be difficult to escape from the pool pictured, but\nprobably not impossible. The point where this picture was taken is the\nlast chance for different options.</p>\n<figure>\n<img src=\"EagleCreekPunchBowlOverlook.jpg\"\ntitle=\"EagleCreekPunchBowlOverlook.jpg\" width=\"300\" />\n<figcaption>EagleCreekPunchBowlOverlook.jpg</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>R2 - Punchbowl Falls</strong>: ~65ft from a tree DCL. Use\ncaution as the approach to the rappel station may be slippery and\ndifficult. The rappel take you to the lip of the falls, but keeps you\nmostly out of the flow. <font color=\"red\">Be aware: jumping Punchbowl\nFalls is illegal.</font> While it is possible to jump or ride the falls\nunder certain conditions, every year people are injured and killed\nattempting it. (See \"Red Tape\" below.) It's recommended to extend the\npull side ahead of time; this allows a pull from the far side of the\npool. The last person should also pay special attention to avoid\ntangling the rappel and pull strands as it's a free hang. Note: There is\nsome current at the bottom of the falls that will push you DCL. If there\nare rope pull issues and you need to swim back to the rappel line,\napproach from DCR side of the falls. It's easier than fighting the\ncurrent.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The bottom of Punchbowl Falls is a popular hiking destination. On\nsummer weekends, expect to have an audience.</p>\n<figure>\n<img src=\"EagleCreekPunchBowlFalls.jpg\"\ntitle=\"EagleCreekPunchBowlFalls.jpg\" width=\"450\" />\n<figcaption>EagleCreekPunchBowlFalls.jpg</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>Continue downstream a short distance until you reach Lower Punchbowl\nFalls. There is an easy exit on a trail DCR here.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>J2 - Lower Punchbowl Falls</strong>: 12ft. Or downclimb a\nbig old-growth log. Head downstream a short distance.</li>\n<li><strong>J3</strong>: 6ft+ into a nice narrows. Jumping may also be\npossible from fallen logs spanning the canyon.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Just ahead, the creek swings right and you'll reach the top of\nMetlako Falls. Be careful not to get swept over the falls. In high\nwater, this is easily avoided by hugging the DCL canyon wall as soon as\nthe pinch where the waterfall begins appears (pictured below).</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>R3 - Metlako Falls</strong>: 115ft from two bolts DCL atop\nthe rocks about 8ft above the water. Again, it's recommended to extend\nthe pull side ahead of time; this allows an easier pull below. The last\nperson should pay special attention to avoid tangling the rappel and\npull strands as it's mostly a free hang.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>At the bottom is an amazing amphitheater with Sorenson Falls entering\nDCR. This is the location of the banner photo for this canyon and a\nhighlight of the trip. The amphitheater is worth exploring; there are\nsome interesting rock formations and caves.</p>\n<p>When ready, swim out through a long watery narrows, bypassing an\nenormous logjam DCR. Once through the landslide area, continue until you\nreach:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>J4</strong>: 15ft from DCL into a deep pool. (Or downclimb\ncarefully.) This is the last technical obstacle in the canyon.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>From the last jump, it's about 15-20 minutes of creek hiking\ndownstream to the exit. Watch for a tributary with several waterfalls\n(Wauna Creek) entering DCL. Continue past the tributary a short distance\nand look for the bottom of an open mossy talus field (approx. 45.63157,\n-121.90789). Exit the creek into the talus field (if you are doing any\nbushwhacking, you're in the wrong place) and head upwards on an\nascending traverse to climber's left to reach the trail above (~100ft\nelevation gain). There is an old trail leading upwards if you can find\nit. It's easier than it looks.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<h3 id=\"eagle_creek_is_open\">Eagle Creek is Open!</h3>\n<p>The Forest Service has rescinded the long-term closure of Eagle\nCreek; it was closed for almost five years after the 2017 wildfire.\nCanyoneers and paddlers can now legally access the creek, including\nPunchbowl Falls. Please help us retain long-term access by treating the\narea with extra sensitivity and caution.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a\nhref=\"https://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/fseprd1018664.pdf\">Forest\nOrder 06-22-01-22-07</a></li>\n<li><a\nhref=\"https://www.americanwhitewater.org/content/Article/view/article_id/iiVnCt0RukkTm5A1zggjw/\">American\nWhite Water announcement.</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"punchbowl_falls_jumping_injuries_deaths\">Punchbowl Falls:\nJumping Injuries &amp; Deaths</h3>\n<p><font color=\"red\"><strong>Update 2023: A person (non-canyoneer)\njumping the falls broke their hip in July 2023.</strong></font></p>\n<p>Jumping and diving at Punchbowl Falls and Lower Punchbowl Falls is\nprohibited. Despite the closure order, Punchbowl Falls (before the Eagle\nCreek Fire) saw an average of ten Search &amp; Rescue (SAR) missions per\nyear extracting injured jumpers. There were 17 such incidents in 2013.\nThere have been a number of deaths. Many of those injured/killed were\ninspired by online videos of others jumping the falls. Please do not\nencourage others to jump and be cautious of what you post on social\nmedia. Access to this area could be closed by the Forest Service at any\ntime. It very likely be closed again if the number of jumping accidents\ndoes not abate.</p>\n<p><em>\"Past fatalities and serious injuries at Eagle Creek have\ninvolved visitors incurring neck or back injuries after jumping off\n80-foot Punchbowl Falls.

Canyoning is less\nwell-known in this part of the world and hikers may sometimes react\nnegatively to canyoning activities, leading to degraded relations with\nland managers. For this reason, locals suggest trying to do the canyon\nwhen the number of hikers will be low -- particularly early in the\nmorning and on weekdays. While descending the canyon, it is highly\nrecommended to scrupulously follow a Leave-No-Trace ethic. Be aware:\nleaving bright/visible anchors can annoy waterfall photographers, irk\nland managers, and may encourage the inexperienced / unprepared to try\nto follow you.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Please help us keep the canyon clean and pack out any trash you\nmight encounter in the creek.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><img src=\"rwl_en.png\" title=\"rwl_en.png\" alt=\"rwl_en.png\" /><a\nhref=\"http://canyoneeringnorthwest.com/EagleCreek/Eagle_Creek.php\">CanyoneeringNorthwest.com\n(archive.org)</a> : Eagle Creek</li>\n<li><img src=\"rwl_en.png\" title=\"rwl_en.png\" alt=\"rwl_en.png\" /><a\nhref=\"http://ropewiki.com/User:Super_Amazing_Map?id=Eagle_Creek_Canyon_-_Oregon\">Super\nAmazing Map</a> : Eagle Creek Canyon</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<p>{{#ev:vimeo|131145403}}</p>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n",
