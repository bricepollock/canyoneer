Although a popular hiking trail is located no more than a few hundred feet away from the creek at all times, the large volume of water and inability to reach the trail from the watercourse present some unusual risks. This is one of the best canyon destinations in the Columbia River Gorge. Eagle is best visited later in the summer when the water levels are lower.\n<\/p><p>Eagle Creek has several options: you could run the upper section, the lower, or both. Lower Eagle is arguably the best part of the canyon and can be completed in a half-day.\n<\/p>\n<ul><li>Please read the \"Red Tape\" section below before visiting this canyon.<\/li>\n<li>Use caution when descending the creek. Post-wildfire hazards such as landslides, fallen trees, and loose rock may persist for many years to come.<\/li><\/ul>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading3\"><h3 id=\"Water_Flow\">Water Flow<\/h3><\/div>\n<p>Eagle Creek has a large watershed (~27mi^2) and retains good water well into late summer. Expect a lot of swimming.\n<\/p>\n<ul><li>Prior to entering any hydraulics, always have a person ready with a throw rope, and be sure there are no obstructions blocking the exit. Expect to be tossed and turned in some of them.  In late summer, the hydraulic threat reduces considerably and may disappear completely. Those at the bottom of the waterfalls are easily avoided.<\/li><\/ul>\n<ul><li>Jumping is a leading cause of canyon injury (broken ankles and legs). Always send someone down first to check the depth and look for submerged obstacles. Please do NOT jump Punchbowl Falls (see \"Red Tape\" below).<\/li><\/ul>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading3\"><h3 id=\"Directions\">Directions<\/h3><\/div>\n<p>From Portland, take I-84 east to exit 41. Turn right off of the exit and park in the lot immediately past the fish hatchery on the left. This is the recommended parking area. (The actual Eagle Creek trailhead is 0.5mi further down the road, but that trailhead is renowned for car break-ins. You've been warned!) Arrive early for parking.\n<\/p>\n<ul><li>The trailhead is only accessible from I-84 eastbound.<\/li>\n<li>Leave nothing of value - and nothing that looks like it could be valuable (ex: visible bags, purses, rope bags) - in your vehicle. Keep stuff in your trunk and out of sight.<\/li><\/ul>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading3\"><h3 id=\"Lower_Eagle\">Lower Eagle<\/h3><\/div>\n<p>Walk the road (flat) for 0.5mi to the actual Eagle Creek trailhead, then continue about 2mi to drop in just above Punchbowl Falls (approx. 45.62087, -121.89252). Descend off-trail down a mossy talus field (there's a bit of an old trail, but it's faint. We typically handline or rappel from a convenient tree about 8ft down into the creek (short nuisance rappel).\n<\/p>\n<ul><li>Beware poison oak along the Eagle Creek trail.

Continue 0.3mi further along the trail. Just above Skoonichuck Falls, locate an old campsite on the left side of the trail. A use trail leads from the campsite down to the creek just above the falls.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading3\"><h3 id=\"Upper_Eagle_2\">Upper Eagle<\/h3><\/div>\n<ul><li><b>R1 - Skoonichuk Falls<\/b>: 120ft from a cairn DCR. The line of the rappel keeps you at the edge of the flow and hydraulics. Although the vertical drop is only about 50ft, the waterfall has two tiers and additional rope is required for the horizontal distance. The second tier can be jumped in the right conditions. It's recommended to extend the pull side ahead of time; this allows for an easy pull from the far side of the pool. In high flow, rappel from a tree DCL at the campsite to avoid the hydraulics.<\/li><\/ul>\n<style data-mw-deduplicate=\"TemplateStyles:r1062633282\">@media all and (max-width:720px){.mw-parser-output .content .thumb>div:not(.thumbinner){display:flex;justify-content:center;flex-wrap:wrap;align-content:flex-start;flex-direction:column}}body.skin-vector .mw-parser-output div.thumb>div:not(.thumbinner){font-size:94%;text-align:center;overflow:hidden;min-width:100px}body.skin-minerva .mw-parser-output div.thumb>div:not(.thumbinner){margin:0 auto;max-width:100%!important}<\/style> \n<div class=\"thumb tright\">\n<div style=\"display:table;\">\n<span class=\"mw-default-size\" typeof=\"mw:Error mw:File\/Frameless\">\n<\/div>\n<\/div><link rel=\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\" href=\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1062633282\"> \n<div class=\"thumb tright\">\n<div style=\"display:table;\">\n<span class=\"mw-default-size\" typeof=\"mw:Error mw:File\/Frameless\">\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<ul><li><b>Hydraulic #1<\/b>: This hydraulic is just before the High Bridge narrows.

Use caution as the approach to the rappel station may be slippery and difficult. The rappel take you to the lip of the falls, but keeps you mostly out of the flow.  <font color=\"red\">Be aware: jumping Punchbowl Falls is illegal.<\/font>  While it is possible to jump or ride the falls under certain conditions, every year people are injured and killed attempting it. (See \"Red Tape\" below.) It's recommended to extend the pull side ahead of time; this allows a pull from the far side of the pool. The last person should also pay special attention to avoid tangling the rappel and pull strands as it's a free hang. Note: There is some current at the bottom of the falls that will push you DCL. If there are rope pull issues and you need to swim back to the rappel line, approach from DCR side of the falls. It's easier than fighting the current. June 2024, there's a lot of wood pushed up against the wall that your rope wants to tangle in.<\/li><\/ul>\n<p>The bottom of Punchbowl Falls is a popular hiking destination. On summer weekends, expect to have an audience. \n<\/p><p><br \/>\n<\/p><p>Continue downstream a short distance until you reach Lower Punchbowl Falls.

Exit the creek into the talus field (if you are doing any serious bushwhacking, you're in the wrong place) and head upwards on an ascending traverse to climber's left to reach the trail above (~100ft elevation gain).

Canyoning is less well-known in this part of the world and hikers may sometimes react negatively to canyoning activities, leading to degraded relations with land managers.  For this reason, locals suggest trying to do the canyon when the number of hikers will be low -- particularly early in the morning and on weekdays.  While descending the canyon, it is highly recommended to scrupulously follow a Leave-No-Trace ethic.
