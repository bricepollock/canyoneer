One member Steve \"Gus\" Henzel (also SUBW) lost his glasses on a ledge in the canyon - and was later seen looking for his glasses - hence the name. This was probably in 1980.\n<\/p>\n\n\n<\/div>","longitude":150.2823,"months":["Oct","Nov","Dec","Jan","Feb","Mar","Apr"],"version":"490e812a9dbe5c346b2b9574ebe8dcec40b94955be2976d68bb4c095c6dc08a0","timeRating":null,"rappelLongestMeters":null,"geojson":null,"url":"https:\/\/ropewiki.com\/Looking_Glass","waterRating":null,"id":77629,"riskRating":null,"name":"Looking Glass","technicalRating":null,"rappelCountMax":null,"quality":0,"permit":"No","vehicle":null,"rappelCountMin":null,"shuttleSeconds":null,"latitude":-33.18}
