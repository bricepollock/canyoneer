Observe the water level: if it seems high or is high, consider going down The Wall instead. (See water level pictures below.) Don wetsuits and gear on the slabs at the river crossing. Last chance for the loo. Follow the stream on river left for about 50m until the river starts to go over the edge. Cut horizontally left at this point next to a large tree (substantial about 1m diameter trunk), along an exposed slope keeping to the base of a cliff on the upper side.

The rock platform is a good place to change and eat and to fill water containers. From the rock platform ascend  Manslaughter Ridge directly south. Head upwards, and occasionally leftwards (not too far left as it cliffs out above the gully). Top out to the left (south) of the Kanangra Walls lookout. As of 2024, the path is well worn. Gloves useful for when pulling on some sharp vegetation along the way. \n<\/p><p><i>Do not ascend Murdering Gully as may be described elsewhere. The slopes are choked with weeds.<\/i>\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading3\"><h3 id=\"Emergency_\/_Early_Exit\"><span id=\"Emergency_.2F_Early_Exit\"><\/span>Emergency \/ Early Exit<\/h3><\/div>\n<p>After P7 there is an emergency or early exit.\nOn RR (south) of the pool at the bottom of P7, ascend the gully. Stay towards the centre of the gully, and do not veer to the right of the gully. Keep a view of the ridge to the left (east) of the gully; when there are no further cliff lines on the spur, traverse out left (east) onto the spur. Follow the spur upwards, veering slightly right and bypassing any further cliffs. Top out at about -33.9827, 150.1014 on the entry path.\nThe early exit makes for a good half-day abseiling trip down the Wall. In low water (&lt;50 ML\/day at Kowmung Gauge) this can be a largely dry trip by using the traverse at P6 and walking off left just before the bottom of P7. In high water, if P8 is too severe for the party, use this exit.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Red_tape\">Red tape<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>None!\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Beta_sites\">Beta sites<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>This Ropewiki page is authoritative.
