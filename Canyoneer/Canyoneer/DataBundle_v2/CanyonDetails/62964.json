  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>A beautiful full day adventure hiking up then dropping off 1700ft\nfrom the top of Black Mountain into Sycamore Canyon 1.5 miles upstream\nfrom Parsons Springs. Named after rappel two and the huge conglomerate\ncliff band pour off and single conglomerate spire at 5300ft in\nelevation.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>Leave as early as possible. Hike up Parsons Trail until you veer off\nto the right up a side drainage then follow the track up and up to the\ndrop-in point.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>Consisting of 7 to 8 rappels before reaching the bottom of Sycamore\nCanyon. The lower end can be somewhat annoying due to some bushwhacking\nbut that's to be expected and typical for the area.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>Hike down canyon to where Parsons springhead starts (top off your\nwater) then locate the well used trail back to your car. There are\nseveral trail creek crossings that require paying attention to if you\nhappen to be travelling in the dark.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<p><a\nhref=\"https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.3938394352847642&amp;type=3\">https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.3938394352847642&amp;type=3</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n<p>First descent by Jay Wisocki, Frank K, Jef F, and Jared K.</p>\n",
