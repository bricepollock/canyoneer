  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>Old School is a fun, pretty, and very short canyon. Ideal to fill an\nhour or two before moving on to something else.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>Park at the first pullout on the left after the Behunin cabin\n(heading east). Carefully cross the Fremont River and follow a social\ntrail up to the sandy plateau in front of you. A canyon will appear on\nthe right: this is Old School. Rim walk along the trail until you see a\nstraightforward climb down into the canyon.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>R1 - 35 feet which can be downclimbed. The usual anchor is set back\nfrom the edge so take precautions to not leave grooves if\nrappelling.</p>\n<p>R2 - 75 feet into a 2-stage rappel with a pool in the middle. Taller\ncanyoneers should be able to stem over the pool without too much\ntrouble.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>Walk out a brushy trail to the same river crossing point as the\napproach.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<h3 id=\"permits\">Permits</h3>\n<p>A permit is required for any and all canyoneering within the\nboundaries of Capitol Reef National Park. Permits have a group-size\nlimit that varies depending on the canyon or route. A separate permit is\nrequired for each canyoneering route. Currently, there is no quota limit\nnor permit cost, though that is likely to change at some point in the\nfuture. Permits can be obtained onsite through a self-serve kiosk\nlocated just outside of the visitor center or by sending and email to\ncare_permits@nps.gov using the following format:</p>\n<p><strong>Subject:</strong> Name of canyoneering route and date you\nwill be canyoneering.</p>\n<p><strong>Email Body:</strong> Date of visit (single day only):\nCanyoneering route (single route only): Number of people: Vehicle\nlocation: Number of motorized vehicles: Vehicle description(s):</p>\n<p>If you plan to camp overnight as part of a canyoneering trip, you are\nrequired to obtain a free backcountry permit, available at the visitor\ncenter.</p>\n<h3 id=\"additional_access_information\">Additional Access\nInformation:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>CRNP canyoneering permit information webpage: <a\nhref=\"https://www.nps.gov/care/planyourvisit/canyoneering.htm\">https://www.nps.gov/care/planyourvisit/canyoneering.htm</a></li>\n<li>Other: <a\nhref=\"http://www.americancanyoneers.org/access-capitol-reef/\">http://www.americancanyoneers.org/access-capitol-reef/</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"group_size_limit\">Group-Size Limit:</h3>\n<p>Canyoneering groups are limited to a maximum of 12 people for this\nCanyon.</p>\n<p>Groups larger than 8 or 12 sharing the same affiliation (school,\nchurch, club, scout group, family, friends, etc., or combination\nthereof) may divide into groups smaller than 8 or 12, provided they do\nnot occupy the same canyon, drainage, general area or the same route on\nthe same day.</p>\n<h3 id=\"park_entrance_fee\">Park Entrance Fee:</h3>\n<p>The Scenic drive is the only area of Capitol Reef where an entry fee\nor park pass is required. Passes can be attained at the visitor center\nor at a self-pay kiosk at the start of the scenic drive.
