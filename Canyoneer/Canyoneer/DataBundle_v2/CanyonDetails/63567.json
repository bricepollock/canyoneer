The road up to the parking on upper Diamond Creek is not great at the best of times. Park at  45.609698°, -123.807365° at a pulloff on either side of the road. Walk uphill on the road until it parallels the creek (you can see it from the road). Drop the minimal elevation down to the creek and walk it downstream ~1100' to R1.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>R1: 50', anchor is a tree DCL.
