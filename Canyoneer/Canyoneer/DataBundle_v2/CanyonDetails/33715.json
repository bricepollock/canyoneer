  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>Combination of Torrente Pieltinis – Novarza Superiore and Novarza\nInferiore (old Novarza) is one of the hardest,most challenging and\nadventurous descents in the region of Friuli. By continuing the Torrente\nLumiei, which is a natural continuation of this combination, we get one\nof the longest and most attractive descents throughout Italy (7-9 hours\nfor progression). The biggest problem is in Novarza Superiore which has\na lot of water troughout most of the year, which was the reason, the\nfirst descent was made in November and the first repetition in December.\nTorrente Pieltinis is a short, very steep canyon, almost without walking\nparts and it ends in Novarza Superiore. Novarza Superiore is at the\nfirst more open with some down climbing, walking and little jumps but in\nthe second half it's narrow in some kind of meander (corridor), with\ndelicate cascades, turbulent pools and a powerfull stream. This part is\nequipped with some delicate hand lines. Canyon ends in the artificial\nlake, which is neccesary to swim through.</p>\n<p><b>Zone:</b> Italy – Friuli – Sauris</p>\n<p><b>Dimensions:</b> Entrance: 1175 m Exit: 705 m Height: 480 m Length:\n2000 m</p>\n<p><b>Period</b> September - November (Avoid it after rain and during\nsnow melt.)</p>\n<p><b>Times:</b> Approach: 0 h Progression: 5-6 h Return: 30 min</p>\n<p><b>Shuttle:</b> Yes (30 minutes)</p>\n<p><b>Equipment:</b> Sufficient (with 10mm bolts with rings, hand lains\n(traverses) are equipped with fixed ropes) Take an additional 15 meters\nof cutting rope, for replacing damaged fixed ropes.</p>\n<p><b>Rope:</b> 2 x 40m</p>\n<p><b>Highest waterfall:</b> 34 m</p>\n<p><b>Possible exit</b> None evident</p>\n<p><b>Maps:</b> Carta Tabacco 02</p>\n<p><b>Attraction:</b> Regional (with Lumiei - National)</p>\n<p><b>Difficulty:</b> V5 a6 IV</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>From Tolmezzo drive in direction to the Villa Santina. In Villa\nSantina turn left to the Ampezzo and in Ampezzo , take the road to\nSauris and follow this road about 3 km to the first hairpin bend left.\nHere is the exit for Lumiei canyon. Park in the lay by on the left a\nlittle further on. With second car continue in the direction to Sauris.\nApproximately 200 meters after the dam on Lago di Sauris turn left for\nLateis (sign). Drive trough village Lateis and continue to the small\nbridge over the Torrente Pieltinis. Cross the bridge and immediately\nturn right on sand (dirt) road. Follow this road to the parking lot with\nwooden benches on the left and a wooden board on the right side.</p>\n<p><b>Checkpoint:</b> From the parking lot follow the road (very steep)\ndownhill to the Torrente Novarza. Maybe it is better to go by foot since\nthe road is very steep (10 min.).</p>\n<p><b>Before the descent is mandatory to verify the water level in\nNovarza!</b></p>\n<p>The enter is on the right side of the parking lot. First rappel is\nfrom the tree on the right side of the stream.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p><b>D 10m:</b> rope on tree (R)</p>\n<p><b>T 2.5m</b></p>\n<p><b>C 6m or S:</b> 1 bolt with ring (R)</p>\n<p><b>C 5m:</b> 1 bolt with ring (R)</p>\n<p><b>C 18m:</b> 1 bolt with ring (L)</p>\n<p><b>C 34m:</b> 2 bolts with ring (L)</p>\n<p><b>C 7m:</b> 1 bolt with ring (L)</p>\n<p><b>D 3m</b></p>\n<p><b>C 7m:</b> 1 bolt with ring (R)</p>\n<p><b>D 10m</b></p>\n<p><b>C 6m:</b> 1 bolt with ring (R)</p>\n<p><b>C 18m:</b> 2 bolts with ring (R)</p>\n<p><b>Confluence with Novarza</b></p>\n<p><b>150m D+W with shouts up to 4m</b></p>\n<p><b>MC 4m:</b> 1 bolt with ring + fixed ropes (L)</p>\n<p><b>C 16m:</b> 2 bolts with ring (L)</p>\n<p><b>C 6m:</b> 1 bolt with ring (R)</p>\n<p><b>MC 4m:</b> 2 bolts with ring + fixed ropes (R)</p>\n<p><b>C 10m:</b> 1 bolt with ring (R)</p>\n<p><b>MC 5m:</b> 2 bolts with ring + fixed ropes (L)</p>\n<p><b>C 8m:</b> 2 bolts with ring (L)</p>\n<p><b>Artificial lake</b></p>\n<p><b>Swim 120m from L side of the lake to the R side of the dam and\nclimb out.!!!
