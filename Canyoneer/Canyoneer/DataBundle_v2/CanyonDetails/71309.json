Parking is very close to the trailhead, the majority of the approach is on trail and the exit of the canyon is just a few minutes away from the parking.  While there is quite a bit of easy to moderately easy downclimbing, the canyon presents opportunities for beginners to build confidence “walking”  and navigating through canyons, practice thigh belays, and rappel in straight forward waterfalls. The main highlight of this canyon is the last rappel which is the featured photo.\n<\/p><p>Note: The downclimbing in this canyon would be considered \"easy\" to folks who are used to downclimbing in the Southwest. At least the rock is not very slippery!\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p><b>Parking<\/b>: Park at or as close to the Mt. Washington trailhead (TH)  as possible. Parts of the road leading up to the TH may be covered in snow depending on the time of year that you go.\n<\/p><p><b>Approach<\/b>: The approach is on the Mt. Washington trail with some off-trail to drop into the creek. In the early season, expect the approach to be covered in snow as you gain altitude and postholing the closer you reach 3800’.  A suggestion to improve the pay-to-play” ratio would be to drop in sooner (around 3400-3500’) to bypass the first few rappels, additional nuisance downclimbing and snow--however, this approach has not been verified.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>If you drop in at 3800’ elevation:\n<\/p><p><br \/>\nR1: 20’ DCR – webbing around tree\n<\/p><p>R2: 15’ – webbing anchor in the center of the creek\n<\/p><p>R3: 25’ DCL – webbing around tree\n<\/p><p>R4: 40’ DCL – webbing around tree\n<\/p><p>R5:  20’ DCR – webbing around tree\n<\/p><p>R6:  60’ DCR – webbing around tree\n<\/p><p>R7: 20’ DCL – webbing around tree\n<\/p><p>R8: 115’  DCR – webbing around tree.
