A 150' partially free-hanging rappel into an interesting cliff-lined bowl. It's right off the road near Vogel Flats and is possibly one of the easiest approaches in the area. This could be combined with Vasquez, Suicide, Silver on the Side, Silver or West Vasquez by dropping into Big Tujunga via this route.\n<\/p>\n<ul><li><ul><li>As with all the Big T canyons your help is needed to keep access open. This entire area is still seeing a slow recovery from the old station fire which means lots of invasive plants and overgrowth in general can quickly close off access to these areas and\/or make your time in them miserable.
