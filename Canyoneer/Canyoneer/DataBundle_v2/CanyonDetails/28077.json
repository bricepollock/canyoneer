The canyon drops 2,500 feet in few miles, with a\nnumber of significant pour-offs, often with cold, wet rock and freezing\npools to swim through. It could easily be called the most rugged canyon\nin Texas.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>Lance Snead wrote \"We built a rock-pile anchor for 125' rappel, did a\nbody belay rappel, swam through freezing pools of water, and rappelled\nthe highest pouroff/waterfall in Texas called Bryan's Falls which is a\nwhopping 425 feet high! It was an incredible experience in a truly\nmagnificent place. I am thankful and humbled to be able to take part in\nit. Hats off to my partners John Fraser and Mike Quinones, two Austin\nFirefighters. Their experience and resourcefulness made the trip a\nsuccess, I was just simply along for the ride, and a ride it was.

He attempted\nagain in 1983 but failed with 465 feet of rope and a large amount of\ntechnical climbing gear. He tried again in December 1984 with Bryan Bock\nand 765 feet of rope. Sellers was successful but Brock died on the\nattempt. His body was found hanging about 170 feet down a 425-foot\npour-off.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a\nhref=\"http://www.bigbendgallery.com/uploads/files/okiehiker/On_The_Edge.doc\">On\nThe Edge, an Exploration of Cattail Canyon (eBook)</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Two experienced vertical cavers - Gary Schindel (later NSS VP from\nSan Antonio) and John Cradit (San Marcos) were stranded in the canyon\nfor several days in May 2004 and required a difficult rescue.</p>\n<p>See Death in Big Bend by Park Service Ranger Laurence Parent. Brock\np. 99-119, Schindel and Cradit p.176-183.</p>\n<p>After their rescue, a 3-day Search and Rescue (SAR) training trip by\nthe Park Service attempted to understand the canyon and prepare for a\nfuture rescue. That became the most notorious SAR \"training\" trip in\nPark Service history. A 500-foot rope was not long enough! Nine Rangers\nspend three days tortuous days getting through the canyon. They all hope\nthat they never have to rescue someone who is injured in the canyon.</p>\n"
