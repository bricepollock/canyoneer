The canyon drops 2,500 feet in few miles, with a number of significant pour-offs, often with cold, wet rock and freezing pools to swim through. It could easily be called the most rugged canyon in Texas.\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Lance Snead wrote \"We built a rock-pile anchor for 125' rappel, did a body belay rappel, swam through freezing pools of water, and rappelled the highest pouroff\/waterfall in Texas called Bryan's Falls which is a whopping 425 feet high!  It was an incredible experience in a truly magnificent place. I am thankful and humbled to be able to take part in it.  Hats off to my partners John Fraser and Mike Quinones, two Austin Firefighters. Their experience and resourcefulness made the trip a success, I was just simply along for the ride, and a ride it was.

He attempted again in 1983 but failed with 465 feet of rope and a large amount of technical climbing gear. He tried again in December 1984 with Bryan Bock and 765 feet of rope. Sellers was successful but Brock died on the attempt. His body was found hanging about 170 feet down a 425-foot pour-off. \n<\/p>\n<ul><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http:\/\/www.bigbendgallery.com\/uploads\/files\/okiehiker\/On_The_Edge.doc\">On The Edge, an Exploration of Cattail Canyon (eBook)<\/a><\/li><\/ul>\n<p>Two experienced vertical cavers - Gary Schindel (later NSS VP from San Antonio) and John Cradit (San Marcos) were stranded in the canyon for several days in May 2004 and required a difficult rescue. \n<\/p><p>See Death in Big Bend by Park Service Ranger Laurence Parent. Brock p. 99-119, Schindel and Cradit p.176-183. \n<\/p><p>After their rescue, a 3-day Search and Rescue (SAR) training trip by the Park Service attempted to understand the canyon and prepare for a future rescue. That became the most notorious SAR \"training\" trip in Park Service history. A 500-foot rope was not long enough! Nine Rangers spend three days tortuous days getting through the canyon. They all hope that they never have to rescue someone who is injured in the canyon.\n<\/p>\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nParsed by mw‐api‐ext.codfw.main‐6779cc57fc‐hxf5b\nCached time: 20240914191952\nCache expiry: 2592000\nReduced expiry: false\nComplications: [show‐toc]\nCPU time usage: 0.005 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.006 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 21\/1000000\nPost‐expand include size: 0\/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 0\/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 2\/100\nExpensive parser function count: 0\/500\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0\/20\nUnstrip post‐expand size: 0\/5000000 bytes\nNumber of Wikibase entities loaded: 0\/400\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%    0.000      1 -total\n-->\n<\/div>","longitude":-103.3348,"id":28077,"geojson":null,"waterRating":null,"technicalRating":null,"timeRating":null,"rappelCountMax":null,"name":"Cattail Canyon"}
