The approach is primarily on trail, the off-trail navigation and bushwhacking are friendly, easy exit, and the creek walking is straight forward. Hopkins has a similar canyon profile to Munra Creek in the Columbia River Gorge as it's open and non-committing.\n<\/p>\n<ul><li>Watershed: 1.32mi^2.  Highest point in the watershed is Prairie Mountain at about 5000ft in elevation.<\/li><\/ul>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Turn off onto Silverbrook Road and park in the pullout immediately on your left.  There's room for several vehicles.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading3\"><h3 id=\"Visiting_the_Checkpoint\">Visiting the Checkpoint<\/h3><\/div>\n<p>From the parking area, walk north up Silverbrook Road 200ft. Note the first driveway on the right and the obvious trail heading up into the forest. Do NOT park here as it may upset the local residents. This is the exit trail and it's worth walking up the short 600ft to view the bottom of the last rappel. Please be respectful of the locals and avoid private property.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading3\"><h3 id=\"Hiking_Up\">Hiking Up<\/h3><\/div>\n<p>From the cars, walk east along the shoulder of Hwy 12 for about five minutes.  Several hundred feet after crossing Hopkins Creek watch for a dirt pullout on your left (beyond the road with houses that is on the left) and note an obvious sandy trail heading steeply up the embankment.  Follow this dirty trail upward to reach the main trail in a couple hundred feet.  The main trail is overgrown in summer, but push on through... it's not that bad and soon gets better.  Follow the trail up to the end of a switchback at about 1700' - and proceed westerly off-trail until you reach Hopkins Creek.  Depending on the season, you may cross a tiny seasonal stream before reaching Hopkins Creek.  A good place to target is to drop into Hopkins just where a small tributary joins it at ~1800ft elevation.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>The descent begins where a tributary East of Hopkins joins with Hopkins Creek. Natural anchors are abundant. Well-placed webbing exists at all drops. The creek is quite pristine and the webbing anchors low profile. Try to avoid adding anchors unless necessary.\n<\/p><p>R1: 70' DCR\n<\/p><p>R2: 20' DCR\n<\/p><p>R3: 20' \n<\/p><p>R4a: ~80’ DCL.

The falls can be descended in 2 or 3 pitches. \n<\/p>\n<ul><li>R5a - 60ft to R5b.  (Or 160' to R5c.)  Anchor is a tree DCL.<\/li>\n<li>R5b - 90ft to R5c.  (Or 200ft to the bottom.)  Anchor is a large cedar DCL with a maple growing across it.  The cedar has webbing &amp; a quick link; the maple has a redundant anchor made from an old piece of canyon lux. The two separate anchors allow the anchor manager to clip in without getting wrapped up in the rappel line. Using this rebelay provides a nearly direct fall line to the next anchor.  Without using R5b (i.e. if rappelling directly from R5a to R5c), the rappeller must scramble up a very slippery slab to the top of the final pitch.  Using R5b has good line-of-sight throughout the sequence and improves communication.<\/li>\n<li>R5c - 100ft to the bottom.  Tree DCL.  The fall line on this rappel keeps you out of the flow even at high flow, though towards the bottom you have the option of getting into side flow.<\/li><\/ul>\n<p>R6: 60' DCL\n<\/p><p>R7: 70' DCL. Traverse ~25’ from sling around tree to access R7 rappel webbing. \n<\/p><p>R8: 80' DCL\n<\/p><p>R9: 180' DCL - Lower Hopkins Creek Falls. **As of 2024, there is a lot of debris\/tree fall at the bottom of R9.
