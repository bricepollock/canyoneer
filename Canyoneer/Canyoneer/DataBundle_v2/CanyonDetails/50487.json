  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>Hopkins Creek is a beginner-friendly canyon featuring 9 drops and an\nimpressive 250' waterfall. The approach is primarily on trail, the\noff-trail navigation and bushwhacking are friendly, easy exit, and the\ncreek walking is straight forward. Hopkins has a similar canyon profile\nto Munra Creek in the Columbia River Gorge as it's open and\nnon-committing.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Watershed: 1.32mi^2. Highest point in the watershed is Prairie\nMountain at about 5000ft in elevation.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>Turn off onto Silverbrook Road and park in the pullout immediately on\nyour left. There's room for several vehicles.</p>\n<h3 id=\"visiting_the_checkpoint\">Visiting the Checkpoint</h3>\n<p>From the parking area, walk north up Silverbrook Road 200ft. Note the\nfirst driveway on the right and the obvious trail heading up into the\nforest. Do NOT park here as it may upset the local residents. This is\nthe exit trail and it's worth walking up the short 600ft to view the\nbottom of the last rappel. Please be respectful of the locals and avoid\nprivate property.</p>\n<h3 id=\"hiking_up\">Hiking Up</h3>\n<p>From the cars, walk east along the shoulder of Hwy 12 for about five\nminutes. Several hundred feet after crossing Hopkins Creek watch for a\ndirt pullout on your left (beyond the road with houses that is on the\nleft) and note an obvious sandy trail heading steeply up the embankment.\nFollow this dirty trail upward to reach the main trail in a couple\nhundred feet. The main trail is overgrown in summer, but push on\nthrough... it's not that bad and soon gets better. Follow the trail up\nto the end of a switchback at about 1700' - and proceed westerly\noff-trail until you reach Hopkins Creek. Depending on the season, you\nmay cross a tiny seasonal stream before reaching Hopkins Creek. A good\nplace to target is to drop into Hopkins just where a small tributary\njoins it at ~1800ft elevation.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>The descent begins where a tributary East of Hopkins joins with\nHopkins Creek. Natural anchors are abundant. Well-placed webbing exists\nat all drops. The creek is quite pristine and the webbing anchors low\nprofile. Try to avoid adding anchors unless necessary.</p>\n<p>R1: 70' DCR</p>\n<p>R2: 20' DCR</p>\n<p>R3: 20'</p>\n<p>R4: 100' DCL. Rappel to the boulders, then up and over. This can be\nunhappily scrambled around DCL.</p>\n<p>R5: ~250' <strong>Upper Hopkins Creek Falls</strong>. The falls can\nbe descended in 2 or 3 pitches.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>R5a - 60ft to R5b. (Or 160' to R5c.) Anchor is a tree DCL.</li>\n<li>R5b - 90ft to R5c. (Or 200ft to the bottom.) Anchor is a large cedar\nDCL with a maple growing across it. The cedar has webbing &amp; a quick\nlink; the maple has a redundant anchor made from an old piece of canyon\nlux. The two separate anchors allow the anchor manager to clip in\nwithout getting wrapped up in the rappel line. Using this rebelay\nprovides a nearly direct fall line to the next anchor. Without using R5b\n(i.e. if rappelling directly from R5a to R5c), the rappeller must\nscramble up a very slippery slab to the top of the final pitch. Using\nR5b has good line-of-sight throughout the sequence and improves\ncommunication.</li>\n<li>R5c - 100ft to the bottom. Tree DCL. The fall line on this rappel\nkeeps you out of the flow even at high flow, though towards the bottom\nyou have the option of getting into side flow.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>R6: 60' DCL</p>\n<p>R7: 70' DCL</p>\n<p>R8: 80' DCL</p>\n<p>R9: 180' DCL - Lower Hopkins Creek Falls</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>After Lower Hopkins Creek Falls, look for a trail DCR that will take\nyou back to the parking lot. Please avoid going directly down the creek\nas there are houses nearby.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<p>The exit trail from the last falls leads out to Silverbrook Road,\npassing between two houses. Please be respectful of local residents and\navoid private property. Randle police are constantly ticketing for\nspeeding. Drive within the limits.</p>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<p><a\nhref=\"https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.1360044824122017.1073742050.100003495369243&amp;type=3\"><code>Facebook Album - first descent on December 10,2017</code></a></p>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n<p>This canyon was first descended on December 10, 2017 by Doug Hecker,\nHaruka Lipscomb, Jake Huddleston, Michelle Nilles, Gilly Elor, Sid\nCreutz, and Tiffanie Lin. There appears to be additional waterfalls\naround 2400'. Many thanks to Doug and Nick for sharing this canyon.</p>\n",
