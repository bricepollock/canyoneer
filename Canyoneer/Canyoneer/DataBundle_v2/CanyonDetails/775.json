  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>Spencer Canyon is a beautiful and fun canyon in the Escalante area.\nIt offers some interesting rappels and remarkable scenery. Bring lots of\nwebbing and be prepared to rebuild anchors with limited resources to\nwork with. Make sure you don't pull your ropes until the next anchor is\nwell understood.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>This description covers the technical route following the west fork\nof Spencer Canyon.</p>\n<p>Park at the trailhead at the end of Spencer Flats road, and follow\nthe Old Sheffield road trail for about 0.4 miles before turning left\n(north) on sandy cow trails until you reach a slickrock area. Continue\nnorth-east on the slickrock until you reach a drainage. This is the west\nfork of Spencer Canyon. You can drop in immediately, and proceed\nnorthward along a brushy canyon, or rim-walk along slickrock and sand\nuntil a drop-in location circa 37.71532,-111.34284. Soon after that\npoint you will reach the first rappel.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>R1: 45 feet from a tree down a colorful dryfall.</p>\n<p>Continue downcanyon until you reach a second dryfall. There is a\nbypass route RDC, as well as a narrow slot LDC that appears to go as\nwell.</p>\n<p>Further downcanyon, the canyon forks. Continue RDC with some minor\nboulder-hopping until the next obstacle is reached.</p>\n<p>R2: 35 feet from a tree. Can be bypassed LDC. There may be a pool at\nthe bottom.</p>\n<p>R3: 70 feet from webbing extended from a tree and a rock horn high\nRDC and down from a rock promontory. This rappel has two stages and\noften lands the rappeler into another pool. There appears to be a bypass\ngully LDC as well.</p>\n<p>R4: 40 feet from a cairn anchor through a short corkscrew slot with\nseveral tiers and small potholes.</p>\n<p>R5: 50 feet from webbing extended from a deadman anchor in the last\npothole of the slot, through a possible pool and down to the edge of the\ndrop.</p>\n<p>R6: 40 feet down into a very narrow slot, which some might downclimb\nbut shouldn't due to possible slippery walls. This slot holds water and\nwill likely be a swimmer unless you can stem over it. More rope will be\nneeded to pull from what may be a dry spot created by a small log jam.\nIt would be easy to get your rope stuck here.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>After the technical section, there is another swimmer with wider\nwalls than R6. Some might be able to stem this section as well. Continue\ndown canyon nearly a mile through stretches of narrows and past a number\nof obstacles. Depending on water levels there may be a few more wading\npools, one of which can be bypassed LDC with an easy but slightly\nexposed climb.</p>\n<p>At the four-way junction, turn right and continue upcanyon briefly.\nPast a small dryfall in the watercourse, a deep side canyon appears on\nthe right. You may see a cairn here. Start climbing up the ridge left of\nthat canyon and continue up to the rim. There are a couple of climbing\nmoves required, but nothing too difficult. Hop over a small crack\nbetween fins and continue to the top where you will see a tiny rock\narch. Continue west along the sandstone fin until you reach sand, then\nslickrock, then sand again. Merge with Old Sheffield road and slog on\nback to the trailhead.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><img src=\"rwl_en.png\" title=\"rwl_en.png\" alt=\"rwl_en.png\" /><a\nhref=\"http://climb-utah.com/Escalante/spencer.htm\">Climb-Utah.com</a> :\nSpencer Canyon</li>\n<li><img src=\"rwl_en.png\" title=\"rwl_en.png\" alt=\"rwl_en.png\" /><a\nhref=\"http://americansouthwest.net/slot_canyons/spencer-canyon/index.html\">AmericanSouthwest.net</a>\n: Spencer Canyon</li>\n<li><img src=\"rwl_en.png\" title=\"rwl_en.png\" alt=\"rwl_en.png\" /><a\nhref=\"http://roadtripryan.com/go/t/utah/escalante/spencer-canyon\">RoadTripRyan.com</a>\n: Spencer Canyon</li>\n<li><img src=\"rwl_en.png\" title=\"rwl_en.png\" alt=\"rwl_en.png\" /><a\nhref=\"http://ropewiki.com/User:Super_Amazing_Map?id=Spencer_Canyon_-_Escalante\">Super\nAmazing Map</a> : Spencer Canyon</li>\n<li><img src=\"rwl_en.png\" title=\"rwl_en.png\" alt=\"rwl_en.png\" /><a\nhref=\"http://bluugnome.com/cyn_route/escalante/escalante_spencer/escalante_spencer.aspx\">BluuGnome.com</a>\n: Spencer Canyon</li>\n<li><a\nhref=\"https://www.stavislost.com/hikes/trail/spencer-canyon\">https://www.stavislost.com/hikes/trail/spencer-canyon</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a\nhref=\"https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.10151001311871103.477885.669366102&amp;type=1&amp;l=cca54bb1ab\">https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.10151001311871103.477885.669366102&amp;type=1&amp;l=cca54bb1ab</a></li>\n<li><img src=\"rwl_en.png\" title=\"rwl_en.png\" alt=\"rwl_en.png\" /><a\nhref=\"http://candition.com/canyons/spencer-canyon\">Candition.com</a> :\nSpencer Canyon</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><img src=\"rwl_en.png\" title=\"rwl_en.png\" alt=\"rwl_en.png\" /><a\nhref=\"https://youtu.be/FUqHoUawH9o\">YouTube.com</a> : Richard Pattison,\nSpencer Canyon movie</li>\n</ul>\n<p>{{#ev:youtube|FUqHoUawH9o}}</p>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n",

The drop at the start of the slot is about 40 feet and can be anchored from log debris to provide a handline. The 40 foot drop is skinny and dark with little light and slick walls. Downclimbing with no handline is possible but is spicy in a tight slot to slither down. One spot mid way down will force larger people out to an uncomfortable exposed stance then one other spot lower down that forces larger people out again. Thin people will have a better time slithering down through this slot but the walls are slick making this a little difficult / dangerous. From the bottom of the drop is a deep dark slot with only a little light filtering in. In this slot are a couple long sections of water that would be swimmers. One of the pools can be stemmed over with moderate effort and the other pool can be stemmed partially in water where you will only get waist deep. Taller people will have an easier time while short people may take the swims. About 750 feet down canyon the slot slowly starts widening out to easier travel and sandy walking.
