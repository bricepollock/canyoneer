You will pass through two gates (passing the\ngiant 'A' created by white painted rocks). You will find the fissure\nright beside the trail.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>Walk along the top of the fissure. It isn't long. At the end you can\nscramble in. It is probably easiest to traverse along the ledges on\neither side to avoid the scrub. You will pass under a large chunk of\nrock and then have the option to downclimb into the deepest section. The\nclimbing is pretty straightforward.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>Exit by reversing the way you came.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><img src=\"rwl_en.png\" title=\"rwl_en.png\" alt=\"rwl_en.png\" /><a\nhref=\"http://hikearizona.com/decoder.php?ZTN=19148\">HikeArizona.com</a>\n: Leah</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n",
