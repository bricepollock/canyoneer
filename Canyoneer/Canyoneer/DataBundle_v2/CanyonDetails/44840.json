The creek was investigated from Deanes Creek. Bob Sault, Steve\nMcDowell and Dave Noble had gone on ahead, found the canyon, but found\nthemselves trapped in a chamber of the canyon by a stired up tiger snake\nin a narrow part below. Keith Maxwell, Rose Adams and Hugh Patterson,\nwho were downstream, helped the party escape by throwing articles of\ntheir clothing on top of the snake to confuse it. (The clothes were\nlater retrieved with the aid of a long stick). A Ramblers party did the\ncanyon properly from above on a later trip and also found the miniature\ncanyon above.(Kameruka Magazine Vol 16 No 2 - July 78).</p>\n<p>Photos from the first visit can be found here: <a\nhref=\"https://www.david-noble.net/canyoning/wolgan/wolgancanyons2.html\">https://www.david-noble.net/canyoning/wolgan/wolgancanyons2.html</a></p>\n"
