As the trail starts to climb there will be an admissions booth on your left (toilets are here too). There is only one path that follows the stream upwards, without any deviations or junctions. Take it as far as you want and enter the stream at the point where all the interesting elements start to disappear.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>This is an easy and straightforward descent. A hiking trail runs along the entire length of the stream making it easy to skip any element of the canyon, and also facilitating an easy extraction if you were to have any incidents.\nSome of the slides land in very shallow pools. All drops should be inspected before jumping or sliding. Owing to the nature of the canyon there are a lot of loose rocks and fallen leaves that can change or mask the depth of the water. \nFor the final abseils, the first can be rigged from a solid tree about 6m back from the top of the drop. \nThe last abseil could potentially be rigged from the poles on the stairways. They are not especially strong, but would probably take a static load over the short distance. Otherwise there are boulders that could be rigged further back from the lip of the drop.\n<\/p>\n<style data-mw-deduplicate=\"TemplateStyles:r1062633282\">@media all and (max-width:720px){.mw-parser-output .content .thumb>div:not(.thumbinner){display:flex;justify-content:center;flex-wrap:wrap;align-content:flex-start;flex-direction:column}}body.skin-vector .mw-parser-output div.thumb>div:not(.thumbinner){font-size:94%;text-align:center;overflow:hidden;min-width:100px}body.skin-minerva .mw-parser-output div.thumb>div:not(.thumbinner){margin:0 auto;max-width:100%!important}<\/style> \n<div class=\"thumb tright\">\n<div style=\"display:table;\">\n<span class=\"mw-default-size\" typeof=\"mw:Error mw:File\/Frameless\">\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Use the approach trail to return back to the carpark.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Red_tape\">Red tape<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Access in contention. The ladies operating the admission booth have had no issues with us. However, one local resident and the individual selling photographs at the base of the final waterfall, were very displeased (although they were both reluctant to divulge any details about who controls access and punishes ‘trespassers’.
