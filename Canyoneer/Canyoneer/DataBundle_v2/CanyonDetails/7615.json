A partner assist may be needed at the final down climb into the hanging pothole. The anchor is bolted on canyon left and is hidden from above. It can be reached from this hanging pothole. Have your best climber go last in order to do the tricky down-climb on the bottom. To get off rappel, there is a tricky stance on a sloping buttress and a tricky down-climb the final 15 feet. Check to be sure your rope has not shrunk much. All 200 feet will be needed. Walkie-Talkies are recommended. From the bottom of the rappel it is impossible to hear LAMAR if there is any wind. This is where Walkie-Talkies are recommended. If you are using a 200 foot rope, it is recommended to tie 30 feet of webbing onto the end of it in order to make it possible to hold onto the rope from the sloping buttress and avoid the wind from taking it out of your hands or pulling you off the ledge. This way you will be able to keep the rope for a Fireman belay and also as a hand-line to get down the 15 foot down climb, for everyone but LAMAR. Be sure to remove this webbing before the rope pull. Partner assist may be needed to get LAMAR off this ledge safely.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Once you reach the telephone lines above, be sure to go north and up over the knoll to the next drainage and then out to the road to avoid trespassing on private property.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Red_tape\">Red tape<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Beta_sites\">Beta sites<\/h2><\/div>\n<ul><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http:\/\/ropewiki.com\/User:Moab_Canyoneering_Book?id=Sunseed_Canyon\">Moab Canyoneering Book by Derek A.
