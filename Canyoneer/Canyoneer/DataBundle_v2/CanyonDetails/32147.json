Both approach ridges are narrow and appropriate caution must be taken to avoid falling off either side.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading3\"><h3 id=\"Direct_approach\">Direct approach<\/h3><\/div>\n<p>Begin at the picnic tables in Cars Land and walk south to the fence.  Follow the fence west to a 10ft ridgeline rock.  Climb this rock and then follow the ridge west to a large arch.  Using a water balloon slingshot, launch a baseball with a thin cord 45' over the arch and then use that thin cord to pull a rope over the arch.  Secure one side of the rope to the ground and ascend the other side to the top of the arch.  Follow the ridge line southwest then south to the beginning of the canyon.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading3\"><h3 id=\"Rooftop_approach\">Rooftop approach<\/h3><\/div>\n<p>For those unconcerned with natural aesthetics on approach, begin in the service parking lot south of the canyon.  Chimney between the small garage and the Radiator Springs ride building to reach the top of the small garage, then take the staircase up to the roof of the Radiator Springs ride building.  Head northeast to some exposed scaffolding facing east and climb it 30' to the top of a ridge.  Head west along the ridge to the top of the canyon.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p><b>R1<\/b>: 29' from tree 10' RDC\n<\/p><p><b>R2<\/b>: 10', possible down climb\n<\/p><p><b>R3<\/b>: 20' from tree RDC\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>At the base of R3, walk a few feet to the tramway and wait for the next available shuttle.  Shuttles run during the daytime, but do not stop so getting on them may require some ingenuity.  Alternately, follow the tramway downhill until you can exit it and head north (crossing the tramway twice more) before reaching the fence at the 10ft climb.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Red_tape\">Red tape<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Backpacks larger than 24\"x15\"x18\" are <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https:\/\/disneyland.disney.go.com\/park-rules\/\">not allowed<\/a>, nor are selfie sticks.
