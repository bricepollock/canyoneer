There is a deep drainage dip at mile 4. There was even a sedan and other SUV-2WD at the parking area. A bit risky without the clearance\/4WD so try to have a follow vehicle in case one of the vehicles gets stuck. It helps to have a real spare tire and check it is good before the drive. Death Valley dirt roads are notorious for causing tire damage. As of Jan. 1, 2018 the deep sand will require AWD.
