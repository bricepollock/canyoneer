There is a deep drainage dip at\nmile 4. There was even a sedan and other SUV-2WD at the parking area. A\nbit risky without the clearance/4WD so try to have a follow vehicle in\ncase one of the vehicles gets stuck. It helps to have a real spare tire\nand check it is good before the drive. Death Valley dirt roads are\nnotorious for causing tire damage. As of Jan. 1, 2018 the deep sand will\nrequire AWD.
