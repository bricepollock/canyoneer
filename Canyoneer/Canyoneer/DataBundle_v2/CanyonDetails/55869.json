  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>Quicksilver Canyon is a half mile section of Silver Creek in the\nWenatchee National Forest east of Snoqualmie Pass. The canyon contains 2\nsmall jumps (12 feet), one pseudo slide, and 5 rappels in a mostly open\ncreekbed. It is notable for its extremely frigid water (even in\nmid-August), and wind especially above the narrows. It has a reasonable\npay-to-play ratio, with an approach entirely on trail, and a mix of\nfeatures including interesting rigging. The canyon is within a 90 minute\ndrive of Seattle.</p>\n<p>Groups should be prepared to reach exposed anchors using retrievable\ntraverse lines and to use unlinked bolt anchors (webbing-less\nbolts).</p>\n<p>To check water flow, follow the creek upstream 2 minutes from the\nparking lot to a small man-made dam and check the pourover.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>Proceed up the Kachess Ridge Trail for 1.3 miles until the trail\nnearly meets the creek. There is a small but obvious trail leading down\nto the creek right above the first jump. Great flat rocks there to\nchange.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>Check the pool depth for any obstructions prior to any jumps. Use\nextra caution as the rock in this creek is very slippery.</p>\n<p><strong>J1:</strong> 8' (optional). Jump from the top or scramble out\nto a ledge DCR and jump. Alternatively, downclimb DCR past a series of\nlittle potholes.</p>\n<p><strong>R1:</strong> 40' bolts DCR. Rappel the whole way, or rappel\ndown part way and slide the rest. (Optional traverse line bolts 15' back\nfrom edge).</p>\n<p>After R1 head DCR across slabs to cut the corner. There's a small DCL\ndownclimb (protectable via webbing), which alternatively can be rapped\nmid-canyon from a log when there's a fun amount of flow.</p>\n<p><strong>R2:</strong> 50' bolts DCL. This anchor is very exposed. A\npair of traverse line bolts have been set up DCL to approach this\nanchor. Traverse line is approximately 35'. <strong>Please rig a\nretrievable traverse line - do not leave rope behind!</strong> Fixed\ntraverse lines present a hazard to other groups, potential for anchor\ndamage from debris, and make the canyon look messy.</p>\n<p><em>R2 commits you to the canyon. It may be possible to escape DCR\nbetween R2 and R3, but the hillside is loose scree and would be very\ndifficult and potentially dangerous to climb.</em></p>\n<p><strong>R3:</strong> 40' DCL to the rebelay, or 50' to the 2nd pool.\nThis anchor has traditionally been off of a tree DCL, but that line\ncrossed a lot of loose rock causing nearly unavoidable rockfall. There\nare now a pair of unlinked bolts center-left, creating a great line and\na great pull. These bolts are positioned in winter flow, so as of fall\n2021, the webbing remains on the tree until we see how the bolts fair\nthe winter. There is a rebelay at the base of the hanging pothole DCR.\nThis hanging pothole can be jumped from a ledge about half way down, but\ncheck depth as there are areas that are shallow or undercut.</p>\n<p><strong>R4:</strong> 15' bolted rebelay DCR. Take special care when\nexiting the pool at the very bottom as it is slippery and uneven, and\nthe pool leads directly to the next big falls. First person down should\nconsider necessary protection to assist others out of the pool. At\nmoderate flow, this exit is not pushy, but high flow could be especially\ndangerous.</p>\n<p><strong>R5:</strong> 70' bolts DCR. This anchor is very exposed.\nTraverse line bolts have been set up DCR to approach this anchor.\nTraverse line is approximately 15'. Please use a retrievable traverse\nline.</p>\n<p><em>Note: These are unlinked ring bolts and are meant to be used\nwithout webbing. <strong>DO NOT ADD WEBBING TO THIS ANCHOR!</strong>\nWebbing here increases the potential for anchor damage from\nfloods/debris. All unlinked ring bolts in the canyon should be\ntemporarily linked for redundancy in rigging, but left unlinked after\nthe rope pull</em></p>\n<p><strong>J2:</strong> 12-18' DCL into a pothole.</p>\n<p><strong>R6:</strong> 30' DCL from webbing around a chockstone.</p>\n<figure>\n<img src=\"Quicksilver_Topo.png\" width=\"600\" />\n</figure>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>Scramble down the creek about 200yds until the walls DCR eventually\ntaper out. There is a noticeable change as you leave the pine forest and\nenter into hardwoods. Shortly after entering the hardwoods, keep an eye\nout for pink flagging on the ends of cut branches on the right. Follow\nflagging into the forest and traverse the hillside, avoiding gaining too\nmuch elevation at first (if you reach a loose scree field or get cliffed\nout, continue to traverse left). Soon the brushy forest opens up to more\ngrassy meadows. Traverse uphill to first ridge line. The flagging ends\nhere so that it is not visible from the hiking trail. From here,\ntraverse down to cross the gully on an established deer trail and\nreenter the forest, traversing gradually upward until you link up with\nthe Kachess Ridge trail. Proceed downhill back to the parking lot.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n<p>Quicksilver canyon was first descended on July 6, 2019 by Jake\nHuddleston, Haruka-James Lipscomb, Kevin Steffa, Michael Henson, and\nTiffanie Lin. We learned that the walls of the canyon DCR are a little\nover 200 ft tall because Tiffanie left her backpack at the top of a drop\nand had to retrieve it. While walking the ridge was beautiful,\nrappelling into the canyon is not advised as the ground is covered in\nloose scree, sharp rocks, and rockfall is a reality.</p>\n<p>It was named Quicksilver Canyon to avoid confusion with nearby Silver\nCreek Canyon along the North Fork Skykomish River.</p>\n",
