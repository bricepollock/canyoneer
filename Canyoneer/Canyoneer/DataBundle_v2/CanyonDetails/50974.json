We started the day at 32F and ended the day at 32F and likely were slightly hypothermic. Freezefest I occurred and we decided to name this creek Bozoo Creek since we felt like a bunch of bozos for running it during the Winter and the next creek over is Yozoo Creek.\n<\/p>\n\n\n<\/div>","rappelCountMax":13,"rappelLongestMeters":60.96,"technicalRating":3,"riskRating":null,"permit":"No"}
