  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>THIS IS NOT A CLASS 2 CANYON. IF YOU ARE TAKING YOUR NON-CANYONEERING\nFRIENDS OUT FOR A HIKE, THIS IS DANGEROUS AND NOT SUITABLE. Despite the\nhappy face in the photo above, this canyon is not suitable for small\nchildren. Down-climbing, chimneying, stemming, and squeezing in tight\nspaces is required. Although a rope is not required for rappelling, this\nis a Class 3 canyon route and rated PG for the mandatory low-stemming\nand short down-climbs.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>Take the dirt road to the exit for Main Butler/start for Fooling\nAround, and park at 38.06334, -110.46798. From this point, hike up the\ndirt road the way you came for 5 minutes to a faint abandoned Jeep road\nheading south. Hike down this old Jeep road almost to the rim, then head\neast to skirt around the ledge until you can see two forks at the head\nof the canyon. Either fork is fine. They are both very open until just\nbefore they meet.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>Starts off slow with a couple easy downclimbs. It's windy and scenic.\nYou get to a point where there is mandatory stemming, downclimbs, and\nseveral optional low silo crossings.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><img src=\"rwl_en.png\" title=\"rwl_en.png\" alt=\"rwl_en.png\" /><a\nhref=\"http://roadtripryan.com/go/t/utah/north-wash/horseplay\">RoadTripRyan.com</a>\n: Horse Play Canyon</li>\n<li><img src=\"rwl_en.png\" title=\"rwl_en.png\" alt=\"rwl_en.png\" /><a\nhref=\"http://ropewiki.com/User:Super_Amazing_Map?id=Horse_Play_Canyon_-_North_Wash\">Super\nAmazing Map</a> : Horse Play Canyon</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><img src=\"rwl_en.png\" title=\"rwl_en.png\" alt=\"rwl_en.png\" /><a\nhref=\"http://candition.com/canyons/horse-play-canyon-north-wash\">Candition.com</a>\n: Horse Play Canyon; North Wash</li>\n<li><img src=\"rwl_en.png\" title=\"rwl_en.png\" alt=\"rwl_en.png\" /><a\nhref=\"https://youtu.be/nDddAv-EiS8\">YouTube.com</a> : Richard Pattison,\nHorse Play Canyon movie</li>\n</ul>\n<p>{{#ev:youtube|nDddAv-EiS8}}</p>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n",
