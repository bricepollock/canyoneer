The owner wishes to\ndevelop the base of the canyon, pending a land swap with the Forest\nService where he would exchange old mining claims near and above\ntreeline for a small strip of land near Canyon Creek, where he will\nbuild a bridge (the land swap negotiations started in early 2016). Once\ndone he plans to build two houses at the base, restore the Thistledown\nmill, create a mill and mine tour attraction, and build a zip line that\nwill criss-cross the lower half of Thistledown Creek. Some road building\nwork has already begun. Needless to say, he does not want people\ntrespassing here, so this canyon is closed.</p>\n"
