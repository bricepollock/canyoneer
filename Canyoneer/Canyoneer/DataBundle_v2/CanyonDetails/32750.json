The owner wishes to develop the base of the canyon, pending a land swap with the Forest Service where he would exchange old mining claims near and above treeline for a small strip of land near Canyon Creek, where he will build a bridge (the land swap negotiations started in early 2016). Once done he plans to build two houses at the base, restore the Thistledown mill, create a mill and mine tour attraction, and build a zip line that will criss-cross the lower half of Thistledown Creek. Some road building work has already begun. Needless to say, he does not want people trespassing here, so this canyon is closed.\n<\/p>\n\n\n<\/div>","url":"https:\/\/ropewiki.com\/Thistledown","rappelCountMin":null,"rappelLongestMeters":null,"permit":"Closed","timeRating":"III","months":["Jul","Aug","Sep"],"geojson":null,"rappelCountMax":null,"technicalRating":3,"waterRating":"C","name":"Thistledown","shuttleSeconds":null}
