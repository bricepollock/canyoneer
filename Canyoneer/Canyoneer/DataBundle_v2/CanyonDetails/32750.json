July 2016\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Background\">Background<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Most of the canyon is on private property. The owner wishes to develop the base of the canyon, pending a land swap with the Forest Service where he would exchange old mining claims near and above treeline for a small strip of land near Canyon Creek, where he will build a bridge (the land swap negotiations started in early 2016). Once done he plans to build two houses at the base, restore the Thistledown mill, create a mill and mine tour attraction, and build a zip line that will criss-cross the lower half of Thistledown Creek. Some road building work has already begun. Needless to say, he does not want people trespassing here, so this canyon is closed.\n<\/p>\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nParsed by mw‐api‐ext.codfw.main‐6779cc57fc‐xflrr\nCached time: 20240914191848\nCache expiry: 2592000\nReduced expiry: false\nComplications: [show‐toc]\nCPU time usage: 0.006 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.007 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 21\/1000000\nPost‐expand include size: 0\/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 0\/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 2\/100\nExpensive parser function count: 0\/500\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0\/20\nUnstrip post‐expand size: 0\/5000000 bytes\nNumber of Wikibase entities loaded: 0\/400\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%    0.000      1 -total\n-->\n<\/div>","rappelLongestMeters":null,"name":"Thistledown","riskRating":null,"version":"d2c9b1934ad136c9e642e7a119ab71232f200824df60ea326ae9475f51ddb4fa","technicalRating":3,"geojson":null,"rappelCountMin":null,"waterRating":"C","shuttleSeconds":null,"permit":"Closed","id":32750,"longitude":-107.6905,"vehicle":null,"quality":1,"rappelCountMax":null,"url":"https:\/\/ropewiki.com\/Thistledown","months":["Jul","Aug","Sep"],"latitude":37.985,"timeRating":"III"}
