It is considered the lower\nsection of the creek. You enter just downstream of the exit for Mordor\nMedio, near the footbridge.</p>\n<p>There is a large parking area for many tourists indicated on the map,\nwhich is the usual place to park. In 2021, we were allowed by the person\nliving at the gate to the private road, to open the gate and drive up\nthe road a short ways, parking in front of the pink house. This saved\nabout 0.25mi of walking each way.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>Mordor Bajo contains one of the biggest drops in the Mordor drainage:\na 90-100m rappel.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<p>You must pay the local owner, named Omar, to hike up their land to\naccess this canyon. The fee was 5,000 colones per person in 2021.</p>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n"
