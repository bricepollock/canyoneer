  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>All Kaibeto area canyons are closed to visitation of any kind by\nnon-Navajo persons. These closures are documented in Michael Kelsey's\nbook Technical Slot Canyon Guide to the Colorado Plateau and on the\nNavajo Parks and Recreation Department website here:<a\nhref=\"https://navajonationparks.org/rules-regulations/\">https://navajonationparks.org/rules-regulations/</a>.\nVisitation to all Kaibeto area canyons is considered trespassing and is\nillegal.</p>\n<p>If you are Navajo and want to do this canyon, you're in for a treat.\nThis canyon has multiple arches, stunning hallways, a short approach,\nand an optional 150-foot rappel. In spring, or after rains, expect\nplenty of wading in water.</p>\n<p>Experienced canyoneers only! There will be several difficult upclimbs\nto get out. Don't go down any features that you can't get back up!</p>\n<p>The route described on this page is an out-and-back, requiring you to\nleave all ropes and ascend back up the canyon. This avoids the long and\narduous Sandslide exit from the main fork of Upper Kaibeto, which would\nthen be followed by a several mile slog through the sand. It is best to\ngo down and then back up this canyon.</p>\n<p>Please note that this canyon requires excellent rope ascending\nskills. It is strongly recommended that each canyoneer carry, and know\nhow to use, a third ascender to cross several difficult lips.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>The road is somewhat sandy, but mostly flat. High clearance is\nrequired, 4WD is not required unless there is heavy mud or recent\nrains.</p>\n<p>From the parking area, track northwest over the gentle sand dunes to\nthe coordinates for the entry. Here it is a gentle downclimb to the\ncanyon floor. Gear up here.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>You will need four ropes: 2x 60meters, and 2x 20 meters. Plus\nhandlines, tons of webbing, and full ascending systems.</p>\n<p>Once you enter the slot, head downcanyon. You'll soon reach a\ndownclimb into a large pothole. A handline will help here. Remember, you\nmust be able to get back up anything you go down. If you can't get back\nup this pothole, tie and leave a handline.</p>\n<p>Continuing downcanyon, the canyon tightens and will go past several\nminor downclimbs and through a window.</p>\n<p>You'll enter a section with three consecutive arches. Here is R1,\nfrom webbing on the left. This webbing looks old, and you should\nprobably tie your own anchor.</p>\n<p>R1: 30 feet.</p>\n<p>After R1 is a stunning section of sculpted hallway. You'll soon reach\nanother rappel into a slime-filled pothole. While you could handline\nthis, it will be significantly easily to ascend later with rope and\ntoothed ascenders instead of a handline. Tie an anchor to a log\nupcanyon.</p>\n<p>R2: 40 feet.</p>\n<p>Next, the canyon becomes deep and dramatic, at R3, off of two old\nbolts on the left. Check these bolts, before tying your webbing on. The\nbolts may be decades old (as of 2020).</p>\n<p>R3 is four stages: 30 feet, 15 feet, 10 feet, 40 feet. A 60 meter\nrope from the bolts will reach. Bring a rope protector for the section\nof your rope between the first and section stage, as your rope will rub\non a sharp outcrop here. Stages 2, 3, and 4 go over difficult lips. Make\nsure you have the gear and skills to ascend back up them before\ncommitting!</p>\n<p>At the bottom of R3 is a mud pit, which may sometimes be a shallow\npool. Here is the balcony for R4.</p>\n<p>R4 is optional: ~150 feet off three bolts on the left. This deposits\nyou on the floor of the main fork of Upper Kaibeto. You can turn around\nat this rappel, or go down, explore the main fork of Upper Kaibeto, and\nthen ascend back up.</p>\n<p>For either option, you will have to ascend six drops, and several\ndifficult upclimbs, to return the way you came back to your car.\nAscension always takes longer, roughly double, the descent time.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>Ascend back up the way you descended.</p>\n<p>Exit the slot at your entry point and walk back to your vehicle.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<p>Entry to this area is restricted for all non-Navajo persons. If you\nare not Navajo, and are in this canyon, is it considered illegal. Please\nrespect local rules and regulations when planning your canyoneering\ntrip.</p>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><img src=\"rwl_en.png\" title=\"rwl_en.png\" alt=\"rwl_en.png\" /><a\nhref=\"http://americansouthwest.net/slot_canyons/east_fork_kabito/canyon.html\">AmericanSouthwest.net</a>\n: Upper Kaibito Creek; East Fork</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n<p>This slot was likely explored in the 1990s. No full description\nappears to have ever been written before this page. The first descent\nparty and date is unknown. A 2020 trip found sections with old ladders\nand a cattle rope for handline, indicating that inexperienced and\npossibly local people entered recently.
