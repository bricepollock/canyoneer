There will be several difficult upclimbs to get out. Don't go down any features that you can't get back up!\n<\/p><p>The route described on this page is an out-and-back, requiring you to leave all ropes and ascend back up the canyon. This avoids the long and arduous Sandslide exit from the main fork of Upper Kaibeto, which would then be followed by a several mile slog through the sand. It is best to go down and then back up this canyon.\n<\/p><p>Please note that this canyon requires excellent rope ascending skills. It is strongly recommended that each canyoneer carry, and know how to use, a third ascender to cross several difficult lips.\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>The road is somewhat sandy, but mostly flat. High clearance is required, 4WD is not required unless there is heavy mud or recent rains.\n<\/p><p>From the parking area, track northwest over the gentle sand dunes to the coordinates for the entry. Here it is a gentle downclimb to the canyon floor. Gear up here.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>You will need four ropes: 2x 60meters, and 2x 20 meters. Plus handlines, tons of webbing, and full ascending systems.\n<\/p><p>Once you enter the slot, head downcanyon. You'll soon reach a downclimb into a large pothole. A handline will help here. Remember, you must be able to get back up anything you go down. If you can't get back up this pothole, tie and leave a handline.\n<\/p><p>Continuing downcanyon, the canyon tightens and will go past several minor downclimbs and through a window. \n<\/p><p>You'll enter a section with three consecutive arches. Here is R1, from webbing on the left. This webbing looks old, and you should probably tie your own anchor.\n<\/p><p>R1: 30 feet.\n<\/p>\n<link rel=\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\" href=\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1062633282\"> \n<div class=\"thumb tright\">\n<div style=\"display:table;\">\n<span class=\"mw-default-size\" typeof=\"mw:Error mw:File\/Frameless\">\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>After R1 is a stunning section of sculpted hallway. You'll soon reach another rappel into a slime-filled pothole. While you could handline this, it will be significantly easily to ascend later with rope and toothed ascenders instead of a handline. Tie an anchor to a log upcanyon.\n<\/p>\n<link rel=\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\" href=\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1062633282\"> \n<div class=\"thumb tright\">\n<div style=\"display:table;\">\n<span class=\"mw-default-size\" typeof=\"mw:Error mw:File\/Frameless\">\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>R2: 40 feet.\n<\/p>\n<link rel=\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\" href=\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1062633282\"> \n<div class=\"thumb tright\">\n<div style=\"display:table;\">\n<span class=\"mw-default-size\" typeof=\"mw:Error mw:File\/Frameless\">\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>Next, the canyon becomes deep and dramatic, at R3, off of two old bolts on the left. Check these bolts, before tying your webbing on. The bolts may be decades old (as of 2020). \n<\/p><p>R3 is four stages: 30 feet, 15 feet, 10 feet, 40 feet. A 60 meter rope from the bolts will reach. Bring a rope protector for the section of your rope between the first and section stage, as your rope will rub on a sharp outcrop here. Stages 2, 3, and 4 go over difficult lips.

You can turn around at this rappel, or go down, explore the main fork of Upper Kaibeto, and then ascend back up.\n<\/p><p>For either option, you will have to ascend six drops, and several difficult upclimbs, to return the way you came back to your car.
