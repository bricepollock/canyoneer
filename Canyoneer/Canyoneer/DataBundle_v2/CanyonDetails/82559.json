  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>In 1961, a movie called \"Ring of Fire\" was filmed in both Oregon and\nWashington. In a particularly exciting set piece, a giant burning\nrailroad trestle collapses while a train is crossing it. This scene was\nshot using an abandoned logging trestle over a narrow gorge carved by\nthe Wynoochee River. In a dramatic proof of gravity, a 60-ton steam\nlocomotive and two passenger cars made a sudden and rather terminal\ndescent to crash into the river below. After the filming, efforts were\nmade clean up the area, but, apparently, the river was too deep and the\ntrain too heavy to remove. So... they're still there. The engine lies\nupside-down, mostly underwater. In summer, when flow on the river is\nlow, you can see the wheels protruding above the water. The rusting\npassenger cars are nearby, leaning, in a giant crazy pile, against the\ncanyon wall.</p>\n<p>Today, the train wreck forms an interesting destination for a short\nhike. There are at least two user trails and a bunch of sketchy fixed\nropes (hand lines) that provide access from the rim to the bottom of the\ncanyon. The wreck seems to be visited fairly frequently.</p>\n<p>This is not a serious canyon destination, but it's an interesting\nplace to visit if you're in the area. Takes maybe an hour or so. (Longer\nif you have to park out at the gate.)</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>Turn off the Wynoochee River Road (FR 2270) about 4.5mi south of FR22\n(road leading to the Wynoochee Dam). Follow the old RR grade (now road)\nin about 2mi. Find a place to park off the road.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Top of the South Trail: 47.32989, -123.64236</li>\n<li>Top of the North Trail: 47.33012, -123.64335 - just a stone's throw\nfurther down the road on the left.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Follow the obvious user trails down to the wreck.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p><font color=\"red\"><strong>WARNING</strong></font> - Use extreme\ncaution on the fixed ropes, especially if conditions are wet, icy,\nsnowy, muddy, etc. There are a number of cliffs, drop-offs, and other\nplaces where slipping / falling / going for a tumble would be Really Bad\n(aka serious injury or death). There is nothing to stop you from going\nover the edge. It's probably better to visit the wreck on a dry day. You\nmay even want to bring your own ropes &amp; gear to descend; it would be\na lot safer.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The fixed ropes may or may not be in good shape; they may have been\nhere for years. Some are not ropes at all, but actually appear to be old\nfire hoses. One rope on the north trail in 2023 had the consistency of\nheavy yarn. All of them seem to be tied to various trees with knots\nranging from the recognizable to the mystery variety. Don't assume\nwhoever tied them knew what they were doing. Be careful how much weight\nyou put on them.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>The south trail has several slippery traverses and seems more\ndangerous. It looks like it follows an old trail that was blasted out of\nthe cliffs. The north trail seems a little safer.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>Return the way you came.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<p>Access is through land owned by a timber company. If the gate on FR\n2270 is closed, you may have to hike in ~2mi along the road. Respect all\npostings and do not block the gate.</p>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0055374/\">IMDB - \"Ring of\nFire\".</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n<p>From IMDB: The bridge that was destroyed in the film was built by the\nSimpson Timber company in 1939, but had been abandoned for nearly a\ndecade. Rails had to be reinstalled on the bridge to allow the steam\nlocomotive and train cars to roll onto it. Explosives were used to\nincrease the dramatic effect of the bridge's collapse. After filming, it\nwas discovered the gorge of the Wynoochee River was too deep to remove\nthe train, so the cars were cut in half and they and the locomotive were\nleft in place. The filming of the bridge fire and collapse took place on\nOctober 7, 1960.</p>\n<h2 id=\"further_explorations\">Further Explorations</h2>\n<p>In late summer, it might be possible to float the Wynoochee River\ncanyon and stop off to visit the wreck along the way. We were guessing\nit may be a kayaking destination.</p>\n",
