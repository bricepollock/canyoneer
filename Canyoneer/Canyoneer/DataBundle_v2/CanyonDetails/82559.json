In a particularly exciting set piece, a giant burning railroad trestle collapses while a train is crossing it. This scene was shot using an abandoned logging trestle over a narrow gorge carved by the Wynoochee River. In a dramatic proof of gravity, a 60-ton steam locomotive and two passenger cars made a sudden and rather terminal descent to crash into the river below. After the filming, efforts were made clean up the area, but, apparently, the river was too deep and the train too heavy to remove. So... they're still there. The engine lies upside-down, mostly underwater. In summer, when flow on the river is low, you can see the wheels protruding above the water. The rusting passenger cars are nearby, leaning, in a giant crazy pile, against the canyon wall.\n<\/p><p>Today, the train wreck forms an interesting destination for a short hike. There are at least two user trails and a bunch of sketchy fixed ropes (hand lines) that provide access from the rim to the bottom of the canyon. The wreck seems to be visited fairly frequently.\n<\/p><p>This is not a serious canyon destination, but it's an interesting place to visit if you're in the area. Takes maybe an hour or so. (Longer if you have to park out at the gate.)\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Turn off the Wynoochee River Road (FR 2270) about 4.5mi south of FR22 (road leading to the Wynoochee Dam).

There is nothing to stop you from going over the edge. It's probably better to visit the wreck on a dry day.

Some are not ropes at all, but actually appear to be old fire hoses. One rope on the north trail in 2023 had the consistency of heavy yarn. All of them seem to be tied to various trees with knots ranging from the recognizable to the mystery variety. Don't assume whoever tied them knew what they were doing. Be careful how much weight you put on them.<\/li><\/ul>\n<ul><li>The south trail has several slippery traverses and seems more dangerous.

Rails had to be reinstalled on the bridge to allow the steam locomotive and train cars to roll onto it. Explosives were used to increase the dramatic effect of the bridge's collapse. After filming, it was discovered the gorge of the Wynoochee River was too deep to remove the train, so the cars were cut in half and they and the locomotive were left in place. The filming of the bridge fire and collapse took place on October 7, 1960.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Further_Explorations\">Further Explorations<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>In late summer, it might be possible to float the Wynoochee River canyon and stop off to visit the wreck along the way.
