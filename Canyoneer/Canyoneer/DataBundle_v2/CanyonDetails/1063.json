  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>Davis Creek is a classic canyon, arguably one of the best in\nWashington. Its beauty is expressed in the deeply incised basalt gorge,\nabundant moss and ferns, and plentiful waterfalls. Not particularly long\n(short approach and exit), and not particularly difficult in low to\nmoderate water levels (most pitches are bolted), this canyon is still\nquite technical, committing, and can be sporting / dangerous in high\nwater. The canyon sports five mandatory rappels of high quality, and\nthree noteworthy jumps in the range of 15-25ft, plus several more\nsmaller ones. With a five minute approach and five minute exit, this\ncanyon has one of the lowest pay-to-play options anywhere.</p>\n<p>Davis Creek is located within both private property and <a\nhref=\"http://www.fs.usda.gov/giffordpinchot/\">Gifford Pinchot National\nForest</a> in Lewis County, Washington. It forms the drainage basin on\nthe south flank of Purcell Mountain, with Cockscomb Mountain and Prairie\nMountain on the west, and Davis Mountain on the east.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The owner of the private land has requested that canyoneers please\nhelp remove any garbage found in the canyon.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"waterflow\">Waterflow</h3>\n<p>The bridge over Davis Creek is the checkpoint for waterflow level, as\nshown in the reference photos. If you see significantly more water,\ndescending the canyon is not recommended. A possible, unconfirmed escape\nroute before R3 (Davis Creek Falls) may exist, so consider this if the\nwaterflow in the easier beginning part of the canyon seems very high.\nAfter descending R3, you may be committed to completing the canyon,\nwhich could be quite dangerous in high water.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A second exit found about 60ft above R5: a deer trail on canyon\nright leading to the canyon rim, with minor scrambling.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Expect very cold water even in the middle of summer, but not as cold\nas glacier melt.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>The closest gauge for water flow appears to be USGS: 14231900 CISPUS\nRIVER AB YELLOWJACKET CREEK NR RANDLE, WA. However there are still some\nnuances and getting a visual from the bridge will be your best\nindication of flows.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Watershed: ~7.3mi^2. The highest point in the watershed is Purcell\nMountain at ~5400ft.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"best_practices\">Best Practices</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Teaching people to rappel for the first time in an aquatic canyon is\nnot a good plan. Much better and safer to become fully proficient with\nrappel devices outside the canyon in a safe dry environment.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Two strand rappels (as is done in alpine climbing) can be dangerous\nin aquatic canyons. Excess rope can be an entanglement hazard in deep\npools, the two strands can get coiled around one another to create an\nobstacle that a rappeller cannot pass, etc. Taking a class in aquatic\ncanyon techniques is strongly recommended.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Beginners \"leading\" beginners is a common cause of accidents in\ncanyoneering. Enthusiasm is not a substitute for training by a competent\nqualified instructor.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<h3 id=\"lower_parking\">Lower Parking</h3>\n<p>From the junction of Hwy 12 and Hwy 131 in Randle, WA: head east on\nHwy 12 for 5.9mi and turn off left/north on Davis Creek Rd. (Be aware:\nDavis Creek Rd intersects Hwy 12 in two places, but bridge linking the\ntwo appears to have been washed out by Davis Creek, so accesss is only\npossible from the western end.) Follow Davis Creek Rd for 1.1mi to a\nlarge \"Road Closed\" sign at the bridge site. FR-63 turns left/north just\nbefore the creek. Park at the bridge or just up FR-63 (unpaved, good\ngravel road) on the righthand shoulder. There is room for several\nvehicles. There are some houses immediately nearby, so please be\ncourteous to the neighbors and locals.</p>\n<h3 id=\"upper_parking\">Upper Parking</h3>\n<p>From the lower parking area, either drive (5min) or hike the road\n(40min) to the upper parking area.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>At 0.6mi up the road is a bridge crossing Davis Creek. This is the\nwater level checkpoint. If water levels are safe, continue another 0.9mi\nup the road. Where the road starts to curve back east, there's a huge\ngrassy pullout on the right/east side of the road. Park here.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"hiking_in\">Hiking In</h3>\n<p>Directly across the road (west side) from the upper parking area,\nfind a faint trail that leads straight down toward Davis Creek. There\nare a couple of ways to enter the creek:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you're lucky, you'll be able to follow the user trail directly to\nwhere it drops right in right above R1.</li>\n<li>If you end out a bit upstream, you'll reach the top of a steep\nforested embankment, perhaps 50ft high. You may need to do a dirty\nrappel to get into the creek from here.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p><strong>Special Notes:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The canyon sees massive floods every year in winter/early spring.\nGiant logs may appear and disappear. Always check the depth and for\nhidden obstacles (e.g. logs) prior to jumping into pools. Jumping is a\nleading cause of canyon injury.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Please do not add webbing to unlinked bolts. Flood debris can catch\nin the bolts and weaken/destroy the anchor.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>R1</strong>: 20ft (6m) from two unlinked bolts DCR, obscured\nbehind log (Or: downclimb DCL and/or shallow jump.)</p>\n<p><strong>R2</strong>: 15ft (5m) from a log in the logjam. As of 2023,\nwasps have made a hive in the log that is currently the anchor. Consider\nrappelling from a tree far DCL up on the bank instead.</p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:red\">WARNING</span>: Descending R3 commits\nyou to the rest of the canyon. The rappels following can be quite\ndangerous in high water.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>R3</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Low to Moderate Water: Rappel 15ft from a root ball into the pool\nand climb out onto the ledge to reach the R4 bolts. Make sure it's\npossible for the first person to climb out of the pool. In high flow,\nyou may risk getting swept over the R4 falls. (Alternatively, downclimb\nDCR very carefully!)</li>\n<li>High Water: This pool may have a hydraulic and is best avoided.\nInstead, rappel 30ft from tree about 10ft up DCR. This provides an easy\nrappel onto the ledge at the top of R4. You may want to tie the end of\nthe R3 rappel line directly to the R4 bolt station (ala rebelay) so that\nothers have a safety line to clip into.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>R4</strong> (<a\nhref=\"http://www.waterfallsnorthwest.com/nws/falls.php?num=5343\">Davis\nCreek Falls</a>): 120ft from 2-bolt anchor DCR. This is a two-tiered\ndrop.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Low to moderate water: Rappel ~80ft into the hanging pool between\nthe tiers. There is an unlinked bolt station (R4+) right at the\npour-over of the second tier. From this anchor, the second tier is about\n40ft. You can rappel either in the flow or around the flow to a dry\nlanding.</li>\n<li>High water: Rappel the full 120ft in one go, staying DCR, and out of\nthe water on the second drop. Use caution when setting the pull line as\nthere's a crack up near the top that can catch and hold a block. As this\nrappel is mostly out of the water, it may be best to have the last\nperson rappel two-strand to avoid snagging your rope. There is also a\ndeviation about 10ft down from the main anchor (DCR) that can assist\nwith keeping you out of the flow in very high water.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Downclimb</strong>: 15ft (5m) waterfall using ledges and logs\nDCL.</p>\n<p>Continue to a narrow hallway flooded with water.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>In high flow, you can bypass R5 &amp; R6 by following a deer trail\nDCR located 20m upstream of R5. Go up over a rise to a sketchy little\ndownclimb (hand line?). Follow the bench to the turn to find 50ft dry\nrappel that drops back in below log jam. NOTE: It appears possible to\ncontinue past this rappel and exit the canyon.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>R5</strong>: 30ft (9m) from a single bolt DCR down a chute.\nThe boulder that used to be here is now at the bottom of the pool. You\ncan stand on top of it in low water to pull your rope.</p>\n<p><strong>R6</strong>: 30ft (9m) from a single bolt anchor DCL into\n<strong>Swirling Pothole #1</strong>. (The DCR bolts are old and should\nbe removed/replaced by a capable party). Alternately, jump DCL or slide\nthe main channel (after checking the depth).</p>\n<p>Climb up over the logjam. Easy in low water; this might be a strainer\nin high flow. There's a short nuisance rappel (or downclimb) into the\nnext pool.</p>\n<p><strong>R7</strong>: 20ft (6m) from two-bolt anchor DCR into\n<strong>Swirling Pothole #2</strong>. The waterfall can create a\nclockwise horizontal recirculating hydraulic in the pool that can be\novercome with proper technique.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Low to Moderate Water: Rappel into the pool. You will land in the\nwhitewater, but it will push you away quickly. Swim DCL to avoid the\nrecirculation and exit the pool.</li>\n<li>High Water: One option is to rappel most of the way down, then flat\njump out toward the exit of the pool to avoid the hydraulic. Send the\nstrongest swimmer first (without pack) to swim aggressively DCL to exit\nthe pool. Once the first person has reached safety, throw down the pull\nside of the rope (secured) in a bag. The first person down can use the\npull side of the rope as a zip-line for the packs and as a throw rope\n(throw the floating bag) for people to grab onto and pull themselves out\nof the pool. In extreme cases, set up a guided rappel using a potshot\n(there are several small stones available, but be ready for an\nalternative if they are gone) and throw the potshot across the pool.\nThis pothole has also been jumped (getting some distance to clear the\nledges below). It was about 15ft deep in 2020.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A small threaded anchor DCR is used as a handhold to downclimb the\nshort drop out of Swirling Pothole #2.</p>\n<p>Just ahead the creek narrows up and there's a small hanging pool\nbefore the next drop in the canyon. This is R8.</p>\n<p><strong>R8</strong>: (<a\nhref=\"http://www.waterfallsnorthwest.com/nws/falls.php?num=5222\">Lower\nDavis Creek Falls</a>): 50ft (21m) from 2-bolt anchor high DCR. This is\nthe crux of the canyon. The rock is very slippery. Extending the pull\nside (need ~70ft of rope) makes for an easier pull (i.e. no need to be\nswimming / treading water at the bottom while attempting the pull).\nThere was a redirect, please do NOT reinstall. Instead, step over the\nlip of the waterfalls and continue down DCL. You will land in a hanging\npothole and have a dry landing spot. The old redirect put you in the\nsame place. This is part of the private land and the landowner doesn’t\nwant to see webbing that appears to be trash.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Low to Moderate Water: If the water is not too strong, one option\n(except for the person managing the rappel station) is to downclimb the\nchute into the pool and then get on rope there.</li>\n<li>High Water: Set up a hand line to reach the anchor. The hydraulic at\nthe bottom of this falls is the strongest in the canyon. Setting rope\nlength is can be difficult here because of the sloping nature of the\nrappel and whitewater at the bottom. Each person should pause before\nentering the strong flow and pull up the rope to make sure no knots have\nformed in the end.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Pass under the bridge. If you see any trash in here, please help us\nkeep the canyon clean by packing it out. Various idiots seem to think\nit's okay to dump stuff off the bridge. If there is something large down\nthere then send a text to Ryan @ 937-603-6218 and share what you saw so\nit can be removed.</p>\n<p><strong>Jump</strong>: 6ft from top of falls. Or downclimb carefully\nDCR. Or rappel from a log DCL.</p>\n<p><strong>R9</strong>: 15ft (5m)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Option A: Scooch your way down a giant log that appeared in 2018. As\nof 2023, a second log has fallen across the first, making for an awkward\nmove to climb over it.</li>\n<li>Option B: Use a human anchor DCL; the last person will downclimb\n(DCR) and may need a partner assist (thigh belay) at the bottom. Or\nscooch down the log.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>R10</strong>: 25ft from two-bolt anchor DCL up in the rocks.\nSomewhat dirty / awkward rappel.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Low to Moderate Water: Rappel down to an enormous house-sized\nboulder. For extra bonus points: float out through a cave-like space\nunder the boulder.</li>\n<li>High Water: Rappel around the boulder DCL.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Jump</strong>: 8ft from top of the waterfall, landing just\npast the whitewater.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>Shortly after the last rappel the canyons opens up. Climb the scree\nslope DCR to reach the road where you parked the vehicle.</p>\n<p>If you finish early and still have stamina, it can be combined with\nnearby super short but super fun <a href=\"Summit_Creek_Canyon\"\ntitle=\"wikilink\">Summit Creek Canyon</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<p>FR-63 passes through a large parcel of private property en route to\nthe upper parking area.

Logjams get moved around and, in 2020,\nthe giant boulder (size of a small car) that was just below R5 abruptly\ndisappeared. It's now underwater at the bottom of a new rappel. Here are\na few pics of the boulder from 2017 to 2020:</p>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n<p>From <a\nhref=\"http://www.canyoneeringnorthwest.com/DavisCreek/Davis_Creek.php\">Canyoneering\nNorthwest</a>: The first known descent was made by Matt Bannon and Paul\nBauer in September 2002. It was a bold undertaking and was among the\nfirst known technical canyoneering descents in Washington. The anchor\nsituation was especially problematic for the first descent party. At one\npoint they had to pre-place a 300 foot rope from the canyon rim in order\nto do a rappel and then retrieve it later. Robert Cobb made the second\nknown descent in 2004 and improved the anchor situation.</p>\n<p>A giant Sequoia sapling has been planted in memory of Luca Chiarabini\nin Davis Creek. It is tucked away DCL in-between the second swirling\npothole and before the rappel beneath the bridge. Please water it if\nyou’re in the canyon and send any pictures of it to Tiffanie Lin\n(cinnybear[at]gmail[dot].com).</p>\n",
