Its beauty is expressed in the deeply incised basalt gorge, abundant moss and ferns, and plentiful waterfalls. Not particularly long (short approach and exit), and not particularly difficult in low to moderate water levels (most pitches are bolted), this canyon is still quite technical, committing, and can be sporting \/ dangerous in high water. The canyon sports five mandatory rappels of high quality, and three noteworthy jumps in the range of 15-25ft, plus several more smaller ones. With a five minute approach and ten minute exit, this canyon has one of the lowest pay-to-play options anywhere. \n<\/p><p>Davis Creek is located within both private property and <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https:\/\/www.fs.usda.gov\/giffordpinchot\/\">Gifford Pinchot National Forest<\/a> in Lewis County, Washington. It forms the drainage basin on the south flank of Purcell Mountain, with Cockscomb Mountain and Prairie Mountain on the west, and Davis Mountain on the east.\n<\/p>\n<ul><li>The owner of the private land has requested that canyoneers please help remove any garbage found in the canyon.<\/li><\/ul>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading3\"><h3 id=\"Waterflow\">Waterflow<\/h3><\/div>\n<p>The bridge over Davis Creek is the checkpoint for waterflow level, as shown in the reference photos. If you see significantly more water, descending the canyon is not recommended. A possible, unconfirmed escape route before R3 (Davis Creek Falls) may exist, so consider this if the waterflow in the easier beginning part of the canyon seems very high. After descending R3, you may be committed to completing the canyon, which could be quite dangerous in high water.\n<\/p>\n<ul><li>A second exit found about 60ft above R5: a deer trail on canyon right leading to the canyon rim, with minor scrambling.<\/li><\/ul>\n<ul><li>Expect very cold water even in the middle of summer, but not as cold as glacier melt.<\/li><\/ul>\n<ul><li>The closest gauge for water flow appears to be USGS: 14231900 CISPUS RIVER AB YELLOWJACKET CREEK NR RANDLE, WA. However there are still some nuances and getting a visual from the bridge will be your best indication of flows.<\/li><\/ul>\n<ul><li>Watershed: ~7.3mi^2.  The highest point in the watershed is Purcell Mountain at ~5400ft.<\/li><\/ul>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading3\"><h3 id=\"Best_Practices\">Best Practices<\/h3><\/div>\n<ul><li>Teaching people to rappel for the first time in an aquatic canyon is not a good plan. Much better and safer to become fully proficient with rappel devices outside the canyon in a safe dry environment.<\/li><\/ul>\n<ul><li>Two strand rappels (as is done in alpine climbing) can be dangerous in aquatic canyons. Excess rope can be an entanglement hazard in deep pools, the two strands can get coiled around one another to create an obstacle that a rappeller cannot pass, etc. Taking a class in aquatic canyon techniques is strongly recommended.<\/li><\/ul>\n<ul><li>Beginners \"leading\" beginners is a common cause of accidents in canyoneering. Enthusiasm is not a substitute for training by a competent qualified instructor.<\/li><\/ul>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading3\"><h3 id=\"Lower_Parking\">Lower Parking<\/h3><\/div>\n<p>From the junction of Hwy 12 and Hwy 131 in Randle, WA:  head east on Hwy 12 for 5.9mi and turn off left\/north on Davis Creek Rd.  (Be aware:  Davis Creek Rd intersects Hwy 12 in two places, but bridge linking the two appears to have been washed out by Davis Creek, so accesss is only possible from the western end.)  Follow Davis Creek Rd for 1.1mi to a large \"Road Closed\" sign at the bridge site.  FR-63 turns left\/north just before the creek.  Park at the bridge or just up FR-63 (unpaved, good gravel road) on the righthand shoulder.  There is room for several vehicles.  There are some houses immediately nearby, so please be courteous to the neighbors and locals.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading3\"><h3 id=\"Upper_Parking\">Upper Parking<\/h3><\/div>\n<p>From the lower parking area, either drive (5min) or hike the road (40min) to the upper parking area.  \n<\/p>\n<ul><li>At 0.6mi up the road is a bridge crossing Davis Creek. This is the water level checkpoint.  If water levels are safe, continue another 0.9mi up the road.  Where the road starts to curve back east, there's a huge grassy pullout on the right\/east side of the road.  Park here.<\/li><\/ul>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading3\"><h3 id=\"Hiking_In\">Hiking In<\/h3><\/div>\n<p>Directly across the road from the upper parking area, find a faint use trail that leads straight down toward Davis Creek. As you get close enough to hear the creek, the trail is faint and splits. Stay left to head directly down and drop in right in right above R1. If you go right at the split you'll reach the top of a steep embankment, perhaps 50ft high and may need to do a dirty rappel to drop in and will be well above R1.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p><b>Special Notes:<\/b>\n<\/p>\n<ul><li>The canyon sees massive floods every year in winter\/early spring.

Rappel 30ft from tree about 10ft up DCR.  This provides an easy rappel onto the ledge at the top of R4. You may want to tie the end of the R3 rappel line directly to the R4 bolt station (ala rebelay) so that others have a safety line to clip into.<\/li><\/ul>\n<p><b>R4<\/b> (<a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http:\/\/www.waterfallsnorthwest.com\/nws\/falls.php?num=5343\">Davis Creek Falls<\/a>): can be done dry in 1-pitch or in 2-pitches in the flow. \n<\/p>\n<ul><li>Low to moderate water: Rappel 80ft onto the rib leading to bolts at the pool pouroff. There is an unlinked bolt station (R4 ) right at the pour-over of the second tier. From this anchor, the second tier is about 40ft. You can rappel either in the flow or around the flow to a dry landing. Get off rappel halfway down the chute onto a 5\" wide ledge for a 20ft jump. The pool is typically 15ft deep or more. Check for wood or new boulders.<\/li>\n<li>High water: Dry rappel 120ft staying DCR and bypassing the big pool and R4b. Use caution when setting the pull line as there's a crack up near the top that can catch and hold a block. As this rappel is mostly out of the water, it may be best to have the last person rappel two-strand to avoid snagging your rope. There is also a deviation about 10ft down from the main anchor (DCR) that helps to stay out of the flow.<\/li><\/ul>\n<p><b>Downclimb<\/b>: 15ft (5m) waterfall using ledges and logs DCL.\n<\/p><p>Continue to a narrow hallway flooded with water.  \n<\/p>\n<ul><li>In high flow, you can bypass R5 &amp; R6 by following a deer trail DCR located 50ft upstream of R5. Go up over a rise to a sketchy little downclimb. Follow the bench to the turn and do a 50ft dry rappel that drops back in below log jam. NOTE:  It appears possible to continue past this rappel and exit the canyon.<\/li><\/ul>\n<p><b>R5<\/b>: 30ft from a single bolt DCR down a chute.  The boulder that used to be here is now at the bottom of the pool.  You can stand on top of it in low water to pull your rope.  \n<\/p><p><b>R6<\/b>: A 15ft vertical slide DCR, or 15ft jump from left, right, or center. For a higher jump of 20' there is a mossy ledge DCR.  Check depth first. Or rappel 30ft from a single bolt anchor DCL into <b>Swirling Pothole #1<\/b>. (The DCR bolts are old and should be removed\/replaced by a capable party).\n<\/p><p>Climb up over the logjam.  Easy in low water; this might be a strainer in high flow.

The waterfall can create a clockwise horizontal recirculating hydraulic in the pool that can be overcome with proper technique. Recommended to zipline packs. \n<\/p>\n<ul><li>Low to Moderate Water: Rappel into the pool. You will land in the whitewater, but it will push you away quickly. Swim DCL to avoid the recirculation and exit the pool.<\/li>\n<li>High Water: One option is to rappel most of the way down, then flat jump out toward the exit of the pool to avoid the hydraulic. Send the strongest swimmer first (without pack) to swim aggressively DCL to exit the pool. Once the first person has reached safety, throw down the pull side of the rope (secured) in a bag. The first person down can use the pull side of the rope as a zip-line for the packs and as a throw rope (throw the floating bag) for people to grab onto and pull themselves out of the pool. In extreme cases, set up a guided rappel using a potshot (there are several small stones available, but be ready for an alternative if they are gone) and throw the potshot across the pool.<\/li><\/ul>\n<p>A small threaded anchor DCR is used as a handhold to downclimb the short drop out of Swirling Pothole #2. \n<\/p><p>Just ahead the creek narrows up and there's a small hanging pool before the next drop in the canyon.

This is the crux of the canyon. The rock is very slippery. Extending the pull side (need ~70ft of rope) makes for an easier pull (i.e. no need to be swimming \/ treading water at the bottom while attempting the pull). There was a redirect, please do NOT reinstall. Instead, step over the lip of the waterfalls and continue down DCL. You will land in a hanging pothole and have a dry landing spot. The old redirect put you in the same place. This is part of the private land and the landowner doesn’t want to see webbing that appears to be trash. \n<\/p>\n<ul><li>Low to Moderate Water: walk down the chute into the tiny pool and get on a platform DCR at the pouroff to get on rope.<\/li>\n<li>High Water: set up a hand line to reach the anchor.
