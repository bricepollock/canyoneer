  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p><strong>This canyon is entirely above treeline, in the fragile alpine\ntundra life zone.</strong> In addition, the slopes and canyon walls here\nare rotten and very crumbly. A misplaced footstep or a poorly planned\nanchor will damage this canyon and the adjacent slopes, and damage from\none canyoner can be enough to require decades of restoration.</p>\n<p><strong>Do NOT go around any of the drops and do NOT exit/enter the\ncanyon midway unless you are having an emergency.</strong> Even one\nperson bypassing a drop will create an unsightly social trail that will\nnot only take decades to heal, but its presence will encourage others to\ntake it, causing even more damage.</p>\n<p><strong>Anchor building is difficult here.</strong> There are no logs\nor trees to sling - it is all rock stacks, and there aren't a lot of\nlarge rocks to choose from. Resist the temptation to go around a drop.\nDo not come here if you aren't skilled in building difficult anchors,\nespecially without using trees and logs.</p>\n<p><strong>This canyon, more than just about any other, is in danger\nfrom recreational use.</strong> The Forest Service is watching it to see\njust how respectful canyoners can be. This canyon is your chance to show\nland managers that we can recreate in the outdoors with a high regard\ntowards nature, putting the resource first. You must practice\nleave-no-trace here in every step you take, in every anchor you build,\nand in every rappel you descend. If you can not do this, or if you\naren't sure, or if you have no formal training with leave-no-trace\ntechniques, skip this canyon.</p>\n<p>Starting at a trailhead elevation of just under 10,700 feet and\nhiking up to the drop-in at a hair under 12,400 feet, this canyon\nrequires high-altitude fitness. While the gain is only 1,700 feet and\ntypical for canyon routes in the San Juan Mountains, the top elevation\nof over 12,000 feet may affect some. If coming from sea level, best to\nacclimitize a few days before attempting this route.</p>\n<p>The views are phenomenal. Above timber line. It is easy to see how\nthis canyon got it's name.</p>\n<p>The \"4\" rating is due to the anchor building requirement. You can\nassume that there will be no anchors and any previous anchors will be\nwashed away as they are all in the watercourse. There is scant material\nto work with. You must be confident in building deadman anchors in the\nwatercourse.</p>\n<p>The \"R\" rating is due to the snow tunnels you must either tunnel\nthrough or walk on top of. They do not appear every year. If they cave\nin you will have only precious minutes to escape from the frigid water\nbefore hypothermia sets in. The snow tunnels and literally freezing\nwater temperatures represent a special risk. Another risk worth\nmentioning is rock fall. All of the canyon walls and floor are brittle\nand easily flake off into little scree shards that are ubiquitous and\nalso very sharp.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>Park at the Rico-Silverton Trailhead, at the end of County Road 7\nthat runs past South Mineral Campground in Silverton. From Ouray Hot\nSprings Park, drive south on Highway 550 for 21.5 miles. Make a right on\nCR7. There is a sign for South Mineral Campground. It is a 7 mile drive\non the dirt road. After South Mineral Campground, high-clearance is\nrequired.</p>\n<p>Hike up the Rico-Silverton trail from the starting elevation of\n10,700ft across a tributary, then up and through South Park until you\nreach a creek crossing at an elevation fo approximately 11,800 feet.\nHere, go off-trail and follow the creek up to the 12,400ft level.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>It looks like you are on the surface of Mars. Well above treeline. In\na barren scree canyon. Rock fall is a serious concern here. Remember,\nLeave-No-Trace techniques are imperative. Follow them; live them!</p>\n<p>You may encounter snowfields above 12,200ft. Find a way down into the\nwatercourse at about 12,400ft. If all of the potential drop-ins are\ncovered by a large snow field, you may have to glissade down to the\nwatercourse, being careful not to put too much weight on the roof of the\nsnow tunnel when you slide onto it.</p>\n<p>You may need to build all anchors from the scant material available.\nMeat-anchor all but the last rappeller in each case.</p>\n<p>R1: Boulder pinch point, mid-watercourse, 100 foot rappel, top 50\nfeet low-angle, bottom 50 feet near vertical. Elevation 12,200 feet. You\nmay be descending into a snow tunnel.</p>\n<p>R2: Deadman, mid-watercourse, 47 foot rappel.</p>\n<p>R3: Deadman, mid-watercourse, 50 foot 2-stage rappel, lively rock\nfall. Take extra care on rope pull due to rock fall.</p>\n<p>R4: Deadman, mid-watercourse, 90-foot rappel, 60-feet above the lip,\nthen 30-foot drop. Do NOT walk around this drop, tempting as it may be.\nThe damage you cause will take decades to heal, and the social trail you\nleave will encourage others to come here and damage it even more. Let\nthe existing impact from inconsiderate canyoners bypassing this drop\nheal. You are here to rappel down a canyon, not walk around the drops.\nSo rappel!</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>Once you are below the technical section, at 12,000ft, best to keep\nyour wetsuit on and creek your way down to the trail itself. The rocks\nin the watercourse are surprisingly grippy, probably due to the calcium\ncarbonate.</p>\n<p>Once you reach the trail, there is a nice space to change out of your\ngear. Head down the trail which takes about 45 minutes.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a\nhref=\"http://ropewiki.com/Canyoning_in_the_Colorado_San_Juan_Mountains_Book\">Canyoning\nin the Colorado San Juan Mountains Book by Ira Lewis</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n",
