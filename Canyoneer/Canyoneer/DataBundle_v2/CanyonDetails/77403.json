  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>This is a relatively short canyon, that is wonderful to do at night\nas it is filled with glow worms.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>You can Park at either just past the exit firetrail at -33.528921,\n150.309351 or at the start firetrail (-33.533047, 150.314165) both on\nBell's Line of Road. Don't follow the entry firetrail to the right, but\ninstead continue downhill from the gate.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>Most the canyon is creek walking, with the main constrictions after\nthe abseil. The main abseil has a difficult start (if rigged from the\nanchor in the creek), and drops about 5m to a pool that often requires a\nswim. In high water the drop can be jumped, but should be checked first\nas is often too shallow. Occasionally the anchor gets moved to a tree on\nthe TL, it then becomes about 10m. This is an easier start.</p>\n<p>At night this cavern is filled with Glow Worms.</p>\n<p>There's an optional second abseil at the end of the canyon that is a\nfair bit longer.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>Follow the resonably well defined track up the slope to it meets the\ncliff line, then follow the base of the cliff until the track goes up to\nmeet a slippery but straightforward scramble. Be careful with navigation\nacross the pagodas as the track is well defined.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<p>This canyon is described in limited detail in Canyons Near Sydney by\nRick Jamieson.</p>\n<p>Notes available on <a\nhref=\"https://ozultimate.com/canyoning/track_notes/dalpura.htm\">Oz\nUltimate</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<p>{{#ev:youtube|XYxPoZrEALA}}</p>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n",
