  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>A very scenic hike up to the top of Bear Mountain followed by a very\nshort approach to the head of the drainage where you will have to\nscramble and bushwack your way down steeply to the first drop.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>Hike the entire length of Bear Mountain trail to the drop-in\npoint.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>I would bring a 200ft rope and pull. The start of this drainage is\nsteep. After rappelling the first drop travel lets up a bit but still\nquite a bit of scrambling down to more drops before reaching the redrock\nsection.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>Take Red Canyon down and if you can help it take the fence line of\nthe Palatki Ruins Property to the left and around to the road where\neither your shuttle awaits or do what we did and hitch hike back to the\nBear Mountain T/H. We only had one car and easily got picked up so that\nwas nice. We hiked straight through the Ruins property where a ranger\nwas at the entry gate and was very curious as to where we came from with\nall the gear we had. He was great and we pointed out to him where we\ndescended from as you can see the top of bear and some of the drainage\nfrom where we were standing, he was kind of speechless as to what we\njust did.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<p><a\nhref=\"https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.4322201327800274&amp;type=3\">https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.4322201327800274&amp;type=3</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n<p>First Descent by Jay Wisocki and Dinna Marquez</p>\n",
