  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>A short canyon with a drop overlooking the 405 near the Getty Center.\nThe rappel can be easily seen from the northbound lanes of the 405.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>Park at the end of Bundy Drive and take the trail up to Mt Saint\nMary's Fire Road, then follow the firebreak to the drop-in. Alternately,\nparking at Mt Saint Mary's could cut off some elevation gain. The\nshortest approach of all would be if you could find a way to park near\nthe bottom of the canyon, but the area is mainly devoted to the Getty\nCenter and parking may not be possible.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>The descent is quick going and mostly brush-free. The one mandatory\nrappel near the end can be anchored from a tree DCR. There are a few\ndownclimbs on smooth black rock after this, then you emerge in the\ndrainage basin next to the 405.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>If you parked on Bundy or Mt Saint Mary's, climb the ridge just north\nof the canyon to get back to the firebreak. It's steep going at first\nbut gets easier with animal trails the higher you go.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n"
