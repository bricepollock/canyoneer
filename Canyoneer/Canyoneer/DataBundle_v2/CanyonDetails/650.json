The trouble with going after Hose after a heavy storm is that Tortilla and Mesquite Creeks may also be flowing, both of which need to be crossed on the drive to the canyon - potentially closing AZ88 in the area.\n<\/p><p>The parking area for the canyon is at Mesquite Flat - a primitive camping and recreational area east of Tortilla Flat.  From the crossing of Tortilla Creek immediately after Tortilla Flat, continue east on AZ88 for one mile to pull out on the left into the parking area after crossing Mesquite Creek.  A good, high clearance 4x4 can drive the rough dirt road that leads to the canyon, or you can park at Mesquite Flat and hike the distance (a little under two miles) on foot.\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>The road to access the canyon is on the northern side of Mesquite Creek and at the western most end of the parking\/camping area.  The road splits at a Y shortly after crossing the creek, stay right at the split to stay on the main road as it winds its way around the upper drainages of Mesquite Creek towards Hose Canyon.  Stay straight (right) at the only other branch in the road that heads west at a little more than 1.5 miles to find a break in the cliff above the drainage of the canyon at a little under two miles to route find your way down into the drainage.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>The first drop is found a short ways down canyon from the cliff break and is a fairly easy 15 foot down climb into a pool that often requires a swim to cross.\n<\/p><p><b>R1<\/b>: 80 feet and is anchored from a tree RDC. Extending the anchor point right to the edge of the drop ensures an easy rope retrieval once down. This rappel also drops into a pool that often has enough water for a short swim.\n<\/p><p>After the first rappel are two somewhat sporty downclimbs through shallow, twisting chutes that some may wish to have a handline for or to perform a short rappel. At the bottom is another potentially deep pool.\n<\/p><p><b>R2<\/b>: 60 feet off a tree.\n<\/p><p>The rest of the canyon to its junction with Crucifix Canyon has a few boulders to navigate but no additional vertical obstacles.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Hike west down Crucifix Canyon a short distance (about .25 mile) to locate a break in the cliffs on your left (south) that provides access back up to the rim of the canyon. This route is convoluted and there are probably a few different ways to get up, but be prepared for a steep climb with minor route-finding and a few sections of class 3 scrambling and easy 4th class. Ascending on the left side of this break seems to be best. After reaching the top of the cliff find your way south back to the road you hiked in on - a GPS is helpful to make sure you are in the right spot here - and retrace your way south on the road back to your car and Mesquite Flat.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Red_tape\">Red tape<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Beta_sites\">Beta sites<\/h2><\/div>\n<ul><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http:\/\/ropewiki.com\/User:Super_Amazing_Map?id=Hose_Canyon_-_Arizona\">Super Amazing Map<\/a> &#160;: Hose Canyon<\/li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http:\/\/hikearizona.com\/decoder.php?ZTN=16369\">HikeArizona.com<\/a> &#160;: Hose Canyon<\/li><\/ul>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media<\/h2><\/div>\n<ul><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external free\" href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/pat.winstanley.7\/media_set?set=a.848686905190008.1073741951.100001461198708&amp;type=3\">https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/pat.winstanley.7\/media_set?set=a.848686905190008.1073741951.100001461198708&amp;type=3<\/a><\/li><\/ul>\n<ul><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external free\" href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/pat.winstanley.7\/media_set?set=a.1994183797306974&amp;type=3\">https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/pat.winstanley.7\/media_set?set=a.1994183797306974&amp;type=3<\/a><\/li><\/ul>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Background\">Background<\/h2><\/div>\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nParsed by mw‐api‐ext.codfw.main‐6779cc57fc‐ckm4f\nCached time: 20240914191849\nCache expiry: 2592000\nReduced expiry: false\nComplications: [show‐toc]\nCPU time usage: 0.006 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.007 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 21\/1000000\nPost‐expand include size: 0\/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 0\/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 2\/100\nExpensive parser function count: 0\/500\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0\/20\nUnstrip post‐expand size: 0\/5000000 bytes\nNumber of Wikibase entities loaded: 0\/400\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%    0.000      1 -total\n-->\n<\/div>","shuttleSeconds":null,"version":"1390f35dbbe8fdffcd47d142a3ffce390089de456fd68859fde605e2d266fe6e","rappelCountMin":2,"longitude":-111.3826,"id":650,"timeRating":"III","rappelLongestMeters":24.38,"technicalRating":3,"name":"Hose Canyon","quality":2.5,"vehicle":"Passenger","waterRating":"B","riskRating":null,"latitude":33.5569,"permit":"No","url":"https:\/\/ropewiki.com\/Hose_Canyon"}
