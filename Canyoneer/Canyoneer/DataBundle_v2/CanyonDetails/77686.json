Help the Australian canyoning community by contributing\ntrack notes to ropewiki.com</p>\n<p>This was one of many well-known errors in Rick Jamieson's guidebook.\nThe grid-reference is the lower section of <a\nhref=\"Closet_(Newnes_Plateau)\"\ntitle=\"wikilink\">Closet_(Newnes_Plateau)</a>. It's not known where the\nname \"Tea-time Canyon\" originated, although the next published canyon to\nthe south is Breakfast Creek, so Breakfast and tea-time is a theme.\nRegardless, Jamieson's \"Tea-time Canyon\" is the lower section of Closet\nCanyon.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n"
