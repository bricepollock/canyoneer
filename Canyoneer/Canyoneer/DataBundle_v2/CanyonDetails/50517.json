The rappel into the huge grotto is very scenic with a large overhang makes for a spicy start.\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>The start of the approach is at the Loy Canyon T\/H and is pretty straight forward, but does require some travel through thick brush and a minor section of class 2 and 3 scrambling where a cliff band must be negotiated. Follow Loy Canyon trail until it crosses a drainage.  Follow drainage up (right).  Follow drainage until it connects with another drainage going south (right). Follow south drainage. Drainage may be bushy. Once starts to open up on left out of drainage, exit drainage left. Continue up cliff bands staying on left of a canyon. A few cairns mark the way. When you hit the top of the red rock layer just below the white rock its only about a 5 minute walk south to the first rappel.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Most all rappels are free hanging with some spicy starts. Your typical canyon gear is needed along with a 200ft rappel line and a 200ft pull cord as well as some back up ropes. A retrievable anchor may come in handy on the grotto rap. The first rappel can be a little tricky to locate as there are a few other minor fingers of the upper drainage at the starting elevation - none much more prominent than the others - the anchor for the first drop is off of a small tree on the right.  \n<\/p><p><b>R1:<\/b>  90' off of tree.\n<\/p><p><b>R2:<\/b>  100' off of tree down into a narrow section to \n<\/p><p><b>R3:<\/b>  100' or 75' to first ledge then downclimb RDC.

Pack up your gear (avoid trampling on what is left of a ruins site) head down the wash until you can work your way over canyon right to contour the lower hill side for easier hiking. Follow the lower hill side until it raps around to the right where you will see your vehicle at the parking lot. About 30 minutes.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Red_tape\">Red tape<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Beta_sites\">Beta sites<\/h2><\/div>\n<ul><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https:\/\/sedonacanyoneering.com\/hang-em-high\/\">sedonacanyoneering.com<\/a> &#160;: Hang Em High<\/li><\/ul>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media<\/h2><\/div>\n<p><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external free\" href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/media\/set\/?set=a.2174374642582964&amp;type=1&amp;l=9014174e8a\">https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/media\/set\/?set=a.2174374642582964&amp;type=1&amp;l=9014174e8a<\/a>\n<\/p><p>{{#ev:vimeo|477393003}}\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Background\">Background<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>First descent by Jay Wisocki and Josh Marks\n<\/p>\n\n\n<\/div>","name":"Hang 'Em High","longitude":-111.914,"rappelCountMax":7,"id":50517,"version":"8c419f2c1b9ce063e5137fc01c613129e461e79beca09eb06356655f8e07beb9","quality":3.5,"technicalRating":3,"waterRating":"A"}
