  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p><font color=\"red\"><strong>Status: OPEN.</strong></font> Be aware: the\nupper part of Summit Creek was overrun by the Eagle Creek wildfire in\nSept 2017. Please use extreme caution when descending the creek. Between\nlandslides, fallen trees, and loose rocks, this area may be very\nunstable and dangerous for some time to come. The canyon may have\nchanged dramatically. Do not rely on the beta below being accurate.\nPlease update the beta if you run the creek. Thanks!</p>\n<p>Summit Creek is the first significant drainage immediately east of\nShellrock Mountain in the Columbia River Gorge. Short and sweet, the\ncreek has two significant falls and is relatively easy to knock out in\nan hour or so. Summit runs on the low side heading into late summer and\nis likely more fun with more water. Currently no trail leads to the\nupper narrows, so expect some bushwhacking and watch out for poison oak.\nNice training creek; not too committing. Good afternoon adventure.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Summit could be combined with Lower Lindsey for an easy day.</li>\n<li>Watershed: 0.82mi^2.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"directions\">Directions</h2>\n<p>There are two possible parking areas for Summit Creek. Both of these\nare ONLY accessible from I-84 traveling eastbound.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Take I-84 east into the Columbia Gorge. About 2.3mi past Wyeth (exit\n51), park in a gravel pulloff just off the highway's shoulder. There is\nroom for 4-5 vehicles. Be aware: this trailhead comes up fast and is\neasy to miss when moving at speed. Be ready for it. A gated powerline\naccess track leads up from the pulloff to a junction with the bike trail\nabove (2min). Do not block the gate. This is the same trailhead for <a\nhref=\"http://ropewiki.com/Lindsey_Creek\">Lindsey Creek</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Alternately, continue east about 1.5mi to Starvation Creek (exit\n55). There is more parking here, plus restrooms. Hike the paved bike\ntrail back west paralleling the highway for 1.6mi to a junction with the\npowerline track mentioned above. Hike takes about 20-30min.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>Follow the powerline access track upwards to a four-way junction\nwhere it meets the paved bike trail. Continue straight across and up\nuntil under the powerlines. Bear left/west and head up an obvious gully\nbefore reaching Summit Creek. Your goal is to drop into Summit Creek\njust at/above 600ft elevation at the top of a nice little narrows\n(approx: 45.6859, -121.7284). The vegetation is thickest just before the\ncreek.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Downclimb 4ft.</li>\n<li>Downclimb 15ft. Large log is wedged in the middle.</li>\n<li>Downclimb 15ft.</li>\n<li>R1: <em>Upper Summit Falls</em>. 30ft off a log DCL.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Head downstream 5-10min; hike in the creek or follow user trails\nalong the banks. Eventually reach the spot where the powerline access\ntrail crosses the creek. Keep going downstream another few minutes\n(easier atop the bank DCR) to reach the top of R2:</p>\n<p>R2: <em>Lower Summit Falls</em> (aka <em>Camp Benson Falls</em>).\n120ft from a big dead tree DCL. Above the falls is a bit of a mess\npost-fire. Most of the rope is needed for the horizontal distance as the\ntree is way back. In an ideal world, would be better to use a traverse\nline (or rappel) to a bolt station right on the edge for safety.</p>\n<p>Below R2, follow the drainage downwards. There are several more short\ndrops below that could be rappelled for fun, but all can be bypassed on\none side or the other.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>Stay in the drainage until you pop out of the woods into a boulder\nfield. Traverse DCR to find a short user-trail winding down to a small\nmeadow adjacent to I-84. Follow the bike trail east up the viaduct until\nyou reach the junction you passed on the way in. Turn left to return to\nyour car.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<p>None.</p>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n<p>Descended by Keith Campbell and Kevin Clark in September 2015.</p>\n",
