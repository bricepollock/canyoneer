backpacking trip paddling down the Colorado river and exploring slot canyons, waterfalls, hot springs and petroglyphs. The best time to go is Fall and Spring. Winter may be fine, but a bit too cold to enjoy the splashing water. Summer will be scorching hot, you may paddle the river but will only be able to hike at night.\n<\/p><p>The Black Canyon part of the Colorado River is filled with spectacular scenery, steep cliffs, narrow river and swift currents give you the feel of the Colorado River, but, technically you are in upper Lake Mohave. The currents are mild, but they can be stronger near the dam when the dam is releasing. This trip does not necessarily require prior paddling experience, but it is recommended to have at least one experienced paddler in each boat.\n<\/p><p>If you go with a commercial company they will charge you $400\/person for such a trip (<a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external free\" href=\"http:\/\/www.kayaklasvegas.com\/kayak_two_day\/\">http:\/\/www.kayaklasvegas.com\/kayak_two_day\/<\/a>).
