Ruckel Creek was overrun by the Eagle Creek wildfire in Sept 2017 and has been closed.  Please check on local closures before planning a trip to this area.  When the area reopens, please use extreme caution when descending the creek.  Between landslides, fallen trees, and loose rocks, this area may be very unstable and dangerous for years to come.  The canyon may have changed dramatically.  Do not rely on the beta below being accurate. This page will be updated when the canyon re-opens.<\/b><\/font>\n<\/p><p>Ruckel Creek is the major drainage just north of the Gorge's famous Ruckel Ridge trail - a classic conditioning hike.  Ruckel has a number of majestic falls beginning around 1200' elevation although they are somewhat widely spaced apart.  This creek would be run more frequently if one did not have to hike up some 2000ft before dropping into the creek.  Ruckel's flow likely drops significantly most years in July.  Expect a long-ish day out if you are not accustomed to bushwhacking and stream-walking.\n<\/p><p>Beware copious amounts of poison oak along the trail.\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Park as per Eagle Creek in the parking lot just south of the Fish Hatchery.  Follow the Gorge bike trail north and east about 0.5mi to the bridge crossing Ruckel Creek.  A good checkpoint on the flow is <i>Lower Ruckel Falls<\/i> (R6), located directly north \/ under the bridge.  \n<\/p><p>Follow the Ruckel Creek trail upwards about 1.75mi, gaining over 2000ft of elevation.  Where the trail bends around the nose of a ridge at about 2180' elevation (45.6402, -121.8976), leave the trail and descend towards the creek.  Follow the path of least resistance (e.g. bushwhacking), losing about 900ft to reach the creek.  Head downstream.  You should drop in just above R1.\n<\/p>\n<ul><li>If you are interested in visiting Epiphany Falls:  continue another mile up the Ruckel Creek trail and drop into the drainage (bushwhack) at approximately 2500' elevation.<\/li><\/ul>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>A number of the drops on Ruckel Creek, particularly Mossy Grotto, are frequently visited by off-trail waterfall photographers.  Please do not leave brightly colored \/ visible webbing atop the falls.\n<\/p>\n<ul><li><i>Epiphany Falls<\/i>:  60ft.  Curtain falls hitting a half-dome ramp below.  Falls is located at about 2100' elevation.<\/li><\/ul>\n<p>It's a 1.3mi hike downstream to the next rappel.\n<\/p>\n<ul><li>R1:  <i>Deadman Falls<\/i> - 30ft.<\/li>\n<li>R2:  <i>Upper Ruckel Falls<\/i> - 110ft.  Free hanging for more than half the rappel.  There is a ledge that travels behind the falls that can be traversed.  Some bones were found on the ledge on a previous visit;  this is likely a favorite cougar haunt.  More bones were found at the base of the falls;  either a cougar kill or old hunter's campsite.  Some old cables and other gear were found at this falls indicating that early visitors may have been considering installation of a trail behind the falls.<\/li><\/ul>\n<p>It is 0.2mi downstream to R3 with a short slide along the way.\n<\/p>\n<ul><li>R3:  <i>Middle Ruckel Falls<\/i> - 70ft.  Freehang more than half the descent.  Can be bypassed DCL.<\/li><\/ul>\n<p>Continue down canyon.  Before long the canyon narrows up as you enter the Cedar Slot.\n<\/p>\n<ul><li>R4:  6ft drop into a waist-chest deep pool.  Pass through a short section of narrows.<\/li>\n<li>R5:  <i>Mossy Grotto Falls<\/i>:  30ft using boulder in the middle of the creek as an anchor.  Can be bypassed high DCR.<\/li><\/ul>\n<p>The rappel drops into an amazing grotto of giant boulders, old growth trees, and lush ferns looking like something out of the Lost World.  Further downstream at lower flow, the creek will vanish as you enter a second boulder garden signaled by a 15ft dryfall.   Bypass via a dirty gully DCL.  Continue through a maze of house-sized boulders through a couple cave-like areas.  Apparently this area got trashed during the winter of 2017;  expect lots of blowdown in the creek.  May be easier to exit the creek entirely.\n<\/p><p>About 20-30min below R5, look for the Ruckel Creek trail on the right.  One can bail out and walk down to the historic bridge where you started.  There is one optional final rappel:\n<\/p>\n<ul><li>R6:  <i>Lower Ruckel Falls<\/i> 40ft.  Scramble carefully down under the bridge, wading through a small channel to the top of the falls.  This area could be dangerous in high water.  Pool at the bottom of the rappel is knee-deep.<\/li><\/ul>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Exit the DCL side of the pool and make your way up a steep user trail to the historic highway.  Beware poison oak.  Follow the bike path back to the parking area at Eagle Creek.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Red_tape\">Red tape<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>NW Forest Pass is required to park at the trailhead.\n<\/p><p>Due to the Eagle Creek Fire, this canyon is closed.
