The narrows are very beautiful with canyon walls on either side that are atleast 200 feet tall. The wall to wall distance will be around 2 - 4 meters. The narrow section is exactly 1 km long. This is the most pretty part of the canyon. During season, the canyon might get really crowded. Most people visit just to hike through this narrow part (and they turn back to the village). After this narrow section, it is a technical section with lots and lots of down climbs.\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Red_tape\">Red tape<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Beta_sites\">Beta sites<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Background\">Background<\/h2><\/div>\n\n\n<\/div>","waterRating":"C","months":["Oct"],"shuttleSeconds":null,"longitude":73.6865,"riskRating":null,"quality":4,"permit":"No","name":"Sandhan Valley","technicalRating":3,"rappelLongestMeters":24.38,"version":"5808186ad213cd9859760bf9b96ee5d213cd08169840be6481ba0482d6b080b6","id":50140,"geojson":null,"timeRating":"III","url":"https:\/\/ropewiki.com\/Sandhan_Valley","vehicle":"High Clearance","rappelCountMin":3}
