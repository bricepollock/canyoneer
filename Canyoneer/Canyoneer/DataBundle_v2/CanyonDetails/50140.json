  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>Sandhan Valley is a pretty narrow canyon located in India. The\nnarrows are very beautiful with canyon walls on either side that are\natleast 200 feet tall. The wall to wall distance will be around 2 - 4\nmeters. The narrow section is exactly 1 km long. This is the most pretty\npart of the canyon. During season, the canyon might get really crowded.\nMost people visit just to hike through this narrow part (and they turn\nback to the village). After this narrow section, it is a technical\nsection with lots and lots of down climbs.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n"
