  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>Like the lower sections of the East Fork, the Atwell Mill section is\na semi-technical canyon with beautiful gorges, deep pools, and clear\nbeautiful water.</p>\n<p>Unlike the lower sections, this part gets really narrow. Like, 3 feet\nwide in spots. We did it with very low water, and found some drops a\nlittle challenging to downclimb with the flow. With more water, the\nchallenge would definitely increase, and ropes might be required?</p>\n<p>The character of this upper part is also enhanced by big sequoia\ntrees (and logs) down in the canyon. It might be the most scenic\nsection. It is also the most remote, and requires a pretty serious\nascent back out of the gorge.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>Spot a car at the gate (don't block it) here:\n36.446902,-118.704314</p>\n<p>Drive 3 miles up to Atwell Mill campground (park at the hiker parking\nif you aren't camping) and head down the Atwell-Hockett trail. We\nstarted bushwhacking down off the trail fairly shortly to shortcut to\nthe East Fork, but in retrospect it might be easier to go down from the\nbridge?</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>The canyon starts out somewhat open downclimbing beside waterfalls. A\nlittle ways down it enters a set of very narrow gorges, likely very\ndangerous at high water but almost certainly bypassable. It then drops\ninto a beautiful bedrock gorge with small waterfalls, jumps and slides\nthen opens up again.</p>\n<p>Further down the is a gorge with two large drops, waterfalls pouring\noff of either side of giant chock stones. This is probably the highlight\nof the canyon. Both are jumps. The first is straight forward. The second\nrequires that you jump not very far out, and land in between two\nunderwater shelves.</p>\n<p>Below there a beautiful redwood log lays across the canyon, before it\nenters another very pretty gorge that is climbed down. The canyon opens\nup a bit with some boulder hopping for a while, then enters a final set\nof waterfalls and gorges. A waterfall ends in a wide pool with streams\nand boulders downstream marking the end of the canyon.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>After that waterfall (36.437049,-118.699906) you'll need to find a\nway up to the right. It's pretty cliffy... I'm not sure if it goes. We\nmissed the exit, and went too far downstream and it kind of sucked. It\nlooks like there should be a way in between the cliffs.. maybe?</p>\n<p>If you can't or don't want to try to get out there, go a quarter mile\ndownstream.</p>\n<p>The trick is, you want to cut back to that ridge and get here:\n36.438965,-118.701011</p>\n<p>This is where there is an old fireline which you can follow up with\nrelatively minimal bushwhacking to your car. If you don't find this\nfireline, you might end up dead buried under manzanita? Feel free to\nupdate this page or let me know so I can if you do it and find a good\nroute!</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n",
