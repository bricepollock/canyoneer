The southerly orientation and multiple obligatory swims make it more suited to warm spring and summer days. While there are no free hanging abseils, the main four pitch abseil makes this quite a technical descent.\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Park at the carpark. Walk back to the road and follow it west for 100m until you cross the bridge. After crossing the bridge turn right and head upstream, staying on the left of the creek. The start of the trail is not marked, so keep going until the creek bed narrows and you will find a taped trail. Continue to GRXXXXXX where the trail branches, the right branch continues up the creek bed towards the base of the falls, the other turns left and heads up the hill. Follow the latter. Take something to whack the blackberries and scrub but please refrain from doing this close to the road - to avoid an obvious trail being formed.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<style data-mw-deduplicate=\"TemplateStyles:r1062633282\">@media all and (max-width:720px){.mw-parser-output .content .thumb>div:not(.thumbinner){display:flex;justify-content:center;flex-wrap:wrap;align-content:flex-start;flex-direction:column}}body.skin-vector .mw-parser-output div.thumb>div:not(.thumbinner){font-size:94%;text-align:center;overflow:hidden;min-width:100px}body.skin-minerva .mw-parser-output div.thumb>div:not(.thumbinner){margin:0 auto;max-width:100%!important}<\/style> \n<div class=\"thumb tright\">\n<div style=\"display:table;\">\n<span class=\"mw-default-size\" typeof=\"mw:Error mw:File\/Frameless\">\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>The start of the technical decent can be confirmed by the small brick weir and the water pipe heading down on the river right. The first abseil (R1) is on the TR, and drops down into the pool at the base of the falls. If dry, you can simply walk down this low angled pitch. \n<\/p><p>R2 goes down to a slippery ledge and is better if more rope is fed out so the first abseiler can stay on a rope until the next anchor is reached. From here it is quicker to drop directly down from the T3 anchor, but this goes straight through the main chute and depends on water levels. If the water is high an airy traverse down a sloping ramp (T3) leads down to another anchor (R4) and will keep you clear of the flow. Jump or slide into the obligatory swim at the bottom. \n<\/p><p>A very short walk leads to the next drop. The base of the abseil is not visible from the top and the water will make signals hard to hear. The next anchor is on the ledge below. and requires a small downclimb to access. This can be slippery and may require a belay. The anchors may also be underwater in high flow. R6 is of the best pitches in the canyon if taken through the flow. The second half of the drop can be turned into a jump\/slide.\n<\/p><p>From here, a short downclimb leads to the next anchor (R7). This anchor is quite close to the water. Obligatory swim at the base of falls.Another short walk leads to a series of down climbs. Some parties may want to abseil these or use a handline, but the exposure is minimal. At the bottom of these downclimbs is another short swim. \n<\/p><p>After the swim you will be standing on top of an optional slide (S9 - Steve's Thunder). Abseil down on the TR (R9) and check the depth before comitting to the slide as branches often wash in during storms. \n<\/p><p>This pool is directly above the main falls, and if there is any significant flow consider rigging the abseil, if only to protect group members from getting washed out of the pool and over the waterfall.\n<\/p><p>The last drop is a persistently sloping abseil with multiple hanging re-belays (R10-13).  There is not enough room at any of these for more than three people so larger groups should consider taking multiple ropes.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Follow the creek bed downstream, staying on the TR. After a while you will reach a trail which will take you back to the road.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Red_tape\">Red tape<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Several properties use water from the creek. As with any canyoning trip, ensure you do not introduce freshwater pests and weeds into the creek by following well established procedures. \nRemove all seeds and thorns from the approach BEFORE you get to the water. Ensure your gear has been checked, cleaned and dried thoroughly and completely for at least 48 hours prior to entering the catchement. \nDo not interfere with equipment you find in the creek. \n<\/p><p>The lower waterfall is also a popular tourist spot. The canyon has been equipped so that canyoners are completely invisible to visitors of the waterfall for the entire approach and descent - except when you are close to the carpark. \nPlease do not disturb or interrupt the experience of people who may be visiting the falls, or encourage visitors to venture off the provided walking track.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Beta_sites\">Beta sites<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Carisbrook Creek Canyon v4a3II*** is described in comprehensive detail in <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https:\/\/canyoninginvictoria.org\">Canyoning Around Victoria guidebook<\/a>\n<\/p><p><br \/>\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Background\">Background<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Water:\nSummertime, low flow, but several refreshing obligatory swims.\nIn winter and after rain, becomes more difficult as you need to avoid a sieve and deal with retentive eddies in pools.\n<\/p><p>Catchment:\n12 km2 – Forested \n<\/p><p>Anchors:\nBolts\n<\/p><p>Gear:\nMin 60m rope plus small handline. \nRealistically 2x 60m and a pull cord is necessary for groups larger than 3 because due to avoid large bottlenecks at the rebelays.\n<\/p><p>Flash flood danger:\nMinimal, forested catchment slows drainage and this areas doesn’t tend to get heavy localised showers.
