  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>Fall Creek is a short beautiful canyon with a series of 4 rappels in\nquick succession. It usually has water flowing year round but dies down\nto a trickle or completely dries up over the summer months. Just after a\nlot of rain, water flow could pose a concern, or just make it a lot more\nfun!</p>\n<p>It is a great beginner canyon with a relatively short approach hike\non a disused fire road and all of the drops are bolted.</p>\n<p>To break up the hike and make things a bit more interesting it is\ncommon to do Fall Creek with <a href=\"Classic_Canyon\"\ntitle=\"wikilink\">Classic Canyon</a>. To do this, descend Classic into\nBig Tujunga Canyon and hike upstream until you hit the old fire road\nthat takes you up to Fall Creek. There is an excessive amount of Poison\nOak in this drainage that can be hard to avoid. Take Hand Shears and/or\nloppers.</p>\n<p>It is also possible to drop-in via <a href=\"Lucas_Creek_(Lower)\"\ntitle=\"wikilink\">Lucas Creek (Lower)</a>, <a href=\"Camp_Five_Canyon\"\ntitle=\"wikilink\">Camp Five Canyon</a>, <a href=\"Overlook_Canyon\"\ntitle=\"wikilink\">Overlook Canyon</a> or <a href=\"Overlooked_Gulch\"\ntitle=\"wikilink\">Overlooked Gulch</a>. These options require a short car\nshuttle but cut the approach hike down a bit. All 3 of these canyons are\nmarked on the kml.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>As with all the Big T canyons your help is needed to keep access\nopen. This entire area is still seeing a slow recovery from the old\nstation fire which means lots of invasive plants and overgrowth in\ngeneral can quickly close off access to these areas and/or make your\ntime in them miserable. Consider adding a pair of hand shears and/or\nsmall bypass loppers to your gear list when descending these\nplaces.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a\nhref=\"http://aggie-horticulture.tamu.edu/earthkind/landscape/proper-pruning-techniques/\"><code>Educate yourself on how and why</code></a><code>Â </code><a\nhref=\"http://ep.yimg.com/ay/yhst-136001134851880/forester-8-1-4-by-pass-pro-forged-pruner-pr7240-3.jpg\"><code>1</code></a><br />\n<a\nhref=\"https://www.nationalforests.org/who-we-are/our-impact/angeles\"><code>BIG TUJUNGA CANYON RESTORATION</code></a></p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>Leave nothing visible in your car as there have been break-ins and\neven stolen cars in this area. From the parking area go through the\nwhite gate and down the fire road. At just over 1 mile you will pass\nClassic canyon (marked on the kml). You have the option of leaving the\nedison road here, descending Classic and hiking upstream a little ways\nin Big Tujunga Creek, eventually joining the Edison road again as it\nclimbs the North side of Big Tujunga Canyon.</p>\n<p>Otherwise continue on down the Edison road. A little over 1.5 miles\nfrom the white gate the road crosses Big Tujunga Creek. The road is no\nlonger maintained for any portion of this hike and as such is completely\nwashed away here. There is an old section of the concrete ford &amp; Low\nWater Bridge still on the creek bed. Find your way across the creek and\nup the Edison road on the other side. As you climb the road, stop and\ncarefully survey the route back up the creek to the road crossing -- it\ncan be surprisingly difficult to find the crossing later when you're\ndown in the canyon because brush will divert you around the bridge.\nAbout 1/2 a mile from here is where the first drop-in is.</p>\n<p>There are 3 option of where to drop-in. They are listed shortest to\nlongest. The first option being the quickest access the technical\nportion of the canyon.</p>\n<p>1. The most direct option is from the edison road around 34.3078,\n-118.1633 you will see a use trail on the side of the ridge that heads\ndown into a small tributary and into the canyon. The trail may be faint\ndepending on brush growth. Follow this drainage (staying on the right\nside of the ridge) into Fall Creek. There is a short down-climb at the\nbottom where it joins Fall Creek.</p>\n<p>This option puts you closest to the top of the technical section. The\nother 2 options put you progressively further up the canyon.</p>\n<p>2. Continue along the edison road until you see a metal drainage\nchannel (slide) that goes down into the canyon on your left. If you\nchoose this option be VERY careful of the sharp metal edges and ALWAYS\nwear gloves.</p>\n<p>3. The classic drop-in where the Edison road crosses Fall Creek. Turn\nleft and follow the creek down. As of Feb 2018 there is one tricky log\njam that requires crawling on the ground and some poison oak to\nnegotiate, but it is doable.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>Rappel 1: 40 feet. Anchored to 2 bolts DCR. A short waterfall that\ndrops into a small bowl. Very slippery. It can also be rappelled further\nDCR to avoid the water.</p>\n<p>Rappel 2: 45 feet. Anchored off 2 bolts DCL. In the past rappel 2\n&amp; 3 have been done as 1 rappel. There are bolts now to break these\nup and make the rope pull easier. Check the bolts on the 3rd rappel\nbefore pulling your rope. There can also be a pool of water here\ndepending on conditions.</p>\n<p>Rappel 3: 25 feet. Anchored off 2 bolts DCR.</p>\n<p>Rappel 4: 75 feet. There are 2 sets of bolts DCL, the ones farther\nback provide a more comfortable start and do not present any pull\nissues. This rappel drops you straight down into Big Tujunga Canyon.\nIt's a nice rappel and you most likely get a sprinkling of water\ndepending on flow. At the base of this waterfall there can be a\npool.</p>\n<h5>\n<p>Fall Creek Water Flow</p>\n</h5>\n<p>{{#ev:vimeo|327974402}}</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>After the last rappel start heading upstream in Big Tujunga Creek.\nThe easiest way back to the fire road is to stay DCL left when exiting\nFall Creek, as you travel N-NE UPSTREAM. You will pass through a narrow\ngap. After this, when Big TJ Creek widens and turns to the right, cross\nthe creek and continue on the right side. If you stay close to the\nhillside on the right (south side) of Big TJ there will be several\nobvious ways to get back up onto the fire road. If you find the creek\nturning to the left, you have gone too far. Head back up the road to the\nwhite gate where you parked your vehicle.</p>\n<p>Fall Creek was majorly washed out as of Oct. 2015, it is now mostly\nfree of brush for the entire route.</p>\n<p><strong>Alternate Exit</strong>--After the last rappel in Fall Creek,\nfollow the stream to Big Tujunga Creek and continue about 100'\nDOWNSTREAM (Big TJ Creek DCR) At 34.305647, -118.163109 you will see an\nobvious rock chute that can be up-climbed with only moderate difficulty.\nClimb up to the fall creek edison road, about 140' of elevation gain, to\nthe gravel road at 34.30580, -118.162603 This exit will save about 30-40\nminutes and some unpleasant bushwhacking in Big TJ Creek.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><img src=\"rwl_en.png\" title=\"rwl_en.png\" alt=\"rwl_en.png\" /><a\nhref=\"http://brennen.caltech.edu/advents/fallcr.htm\">Chris Brennen's\nAdventure Hikes (St Gabriels)</a> : Fall Creek</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.ucanyon.com/?s=fall+creek\">uCanyon Beta</a></li>\n<li><img src=\"rwl_en.png\" title=\"rwl_en.png\" alt=\"rwl_en.png\" /><a\nhref=\"http://canyonchronicles.com/fall-creek?kmlidx=205701186783545362755.0004e400b81d78b0a4e02\">CanyonChronicles.com</a>\n: Fall Creek</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><img src=\"rwl_en.png\" title=\"rwl_en.png\" alt=\"rwl_en.png\" /><a\nhref=\"http://candition.com/canyons/fall-creek\">Candition.com</a> : Fall\nCreek</li>\n<li><a\nhref=\"https://www.duffyknox.com/Content/n-f5S3bd/photography/sports/Canyoneering/Fall-creekclassic-canyon-Sept\">Fall\nCreek and Classic Canyon September 2008</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n",
