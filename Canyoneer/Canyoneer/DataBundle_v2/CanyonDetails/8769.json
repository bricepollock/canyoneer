During rains, one can see some attractive cascades in this small canyon, leading one to believe it may be a fun canyon to descend. Such is not the case. While there are some briefly attractive spots, the bushwhacking is nearly intolerable, and this canyon is in the top 5 on the author's list of canyons with the most Poison Oak he's ever encountered. Many spiky bushes are also present. The author solidly recommends against visiting this canyon.\n<\/p><p>If you do decide to descend this canyon, you would do well to bring a friend and two machetes. Beer would help as well.\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>You will park at the large turnout on the west side of Route 39, across from the entrance road for the San Gabriel Dam. Alternately, one can park at the large turnout further up Route 39 on the right side, just before the long right hand sweeper (turn). This places you very close to the end of the hike out, and eliminates the walk down the road, which can leave little room for walking at times.\n<\/p><p>Hike up the ridge for approximately one mile and 2500ft of gain. Keep your eyes on the map so that you drop into the correct draw. The upper section of the canyon is split by a small spur, which has only minor bushwhacking for a distance. Take full advantage of this and drop into the canyon itself as late as possible.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Descent is defined by endless bushwhacking, with short sections here and there which offer downclimbing on sometimes solid rock with mosses and small plants growing from cracks in the rock. Several easy rappels, one with a small bush as an anchor are followed by more bushwhacking and a final two-stage rappel, where one must rappel down through Poison Oak.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>The last rappel deposits you on easy ground. Hike downhill a short distance and keep your eyes right for the trail directly up a steep hillside to the road.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Red_tape\">Red tape<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>There are signs in the area of people growing pot. Use caution.
