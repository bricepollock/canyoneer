  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>If doing the Full-Monty, meaning ascending up Slot #5, descending #7,\nthen hiking up again and descending #6, this is a 5-Star route IMHO.\nSlot #7 contains some high-stemming over Bombay Slot sections and\nchimneying down very smooth walls with not many features. The slightest\nslip in #7 in some spots would have immense consequences and could be\nfatal. #7 is obviously not for beginners. High-stemming experience is\nrecommended. If ascending #5 and descending #6, this is a\nbeginner-friendly route, but the rating would be 2-Star IMHO. #6 has\nsome sustained stemming at a very comfortable width with very low\nconsequences. There are two up-climbs at the beginning of #5 that may\npose difficulty to a beginner but can be easily defeated with a hand\nline.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>Easy hike down an old 4X4 road to the Dirty Devil River, then 1/2\nmile level hike and a river-crossing. The river is usually knee-deep at\nmost but extremely cold. On the approach, just before reaching the\nriverbed level, it is recommended to find a well-trodden cow trail and\nmake a bee-line for the point on the riverbank that is directly across\nfrom the mouth of Slot #5. It is about 1/2 mile from the bottom of the\nold 4X4 road to the point directly across from the mouth of Slot #5. If\nyou go to the riverbed level you will have to bush whack through\nTamarisk and Willow for this 1/2 mile. Cross the river here at the point\ndirectly across from the mouth of Slot #5. It should take 45 minutes\nfrom the 4X4 Parking spot to the first up-climb in Slot #5.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>Again, a warning that Slot #7 is not for beginners - much stemming\nexperience is recommended before attempting this route due to the high\nconsequences of a mishap. Skipping #7 and descending #6, is however, a\nbeginner-friendly route.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>From the mouth of Slot #6, head a couple hundred feet down river to\nmake the crossing at a shallow spot. Then find the cow trail and go left\nuntil you run into the old 4X4 Jeep road you came down on. Returning\ninvolves this river crossing and then a 450 foot gain.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><img src=\"rwl_en.png\" title=\"rwl_en.png\" alt=\"rwl_en.png\" /><a\nhref=\"http://roadtripryan.com/go/t/utah/north-wash/lower-sand-slide-slots\">RoadTripRyan.com</a>\n: Lower Sand Slide Slots</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n<p>Note, as with any slot canyon, it is impossible to rate this route on\nthe French rating system. If someone were to fall into the bottom of the\nslot in #7 and get wedged in, rescue time would likely be very lengthy\nas a cave-type rescue system would be needed.</p>\n",
