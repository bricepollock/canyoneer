Slot #7 contains some high-stemming over Bombay Slot sections and chimneying down very smooth walls with not many features. The slightest slip in #7 in some spots would have immense consequences and could be fatal. #7 is obviously not for beginners. High-stemming experience is recommended. \nIf ascending #5 and descending #6, this is a beginner-friendly route, but the rating would be 2-Star IMHO. #6 has some sustained stemming at a very comfortable width with very low consequences. There are two up-climbs at the beginning of #5 that may pose difficulty to a beginner but can be easily defeated with a hand line.\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Easy hike down an old 4X4 road to the Dirty Devil River, then 1\/2 mile level hike and a river-crossing. The river is usually knee-deep at most but extremely cold. On the approach, just before reaching the riverbed level, it is recommended to find a well-trodden cow trail and make a bee-line for the point on the riverbank that is directly across from the mouth of Slot #5. It is about 1\/2 mile from the bottom of the old 4X4 road to the point directly across from the mouth of Slot #5. If you go to the riverbed level you will have to bush whack through Tamarisk and Willow for this 1\/2 mile. Cross the river here at the point directly across from the mouth of Slot #5. It should take 45 minutes from the 4X4 Parking spot to the first up-climb in Slot #5.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Again, a warning that Slot #7 is not for beginners - much stemming experience is recommended before attempting this route due to the high consequences of a mishap. Skipping #7 and descending #6, is however, a beginner-friendly route.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>From the mouth of Slot #6, head a couple hundred feet down river to make the crossing at a shallow spot. Then find the cow trail and go left until you run into the old 4X4 Jeep road you came down on. Returning involves this river crossing and then a 450 foot gain.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Red_tape\">Red tape<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Beta_sites\">Beta sites<\/h2><\/div>\n<ul><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http:\/\/roadtripryan.com\/go\/t\/utah\/north-wash\/lower-sand-slide-slots\">RoadTripRyan.com<\/a> &#160;: Lower Sand Slide Slots<\/li><\/ul>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Background\">Background<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Note, as with any slot canyon, it is impossible to rate this route on the French rating system.
