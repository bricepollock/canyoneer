  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>One of the best canyons in the region. High water is usual in this\ncanyon even in August. The Waterflow Analysis produces very accurate\nresults, so make sure you check the flow before you attempt a\ndescent.</p>\n<p>The main checkpoint is a waterfall at the end of the approach hike,\nthe location where you drop into the creek. Use the reference pictures\nbelow to compare with the conditions you find at the checkpoint when you\nstart the canyon, and if too dangerous for your skill level abort the\ndescent. (2011 was an exceptionally high water year, that is the reason\nthe flow was too dangerous to be descended safely even in September)</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<h3 id=\"original\">Original</h3>\n<p>The original approach described in SierraCanyons.org is NOT\nrecommended, as there is a real chance to getting your vehicle locked\nbehind the Crystal Cave road gate if you finish the canyon late.</p>\n<h3 id=\"better\">Better</h3>\n<p>A better approach starts by leaving a vehicle at the Marble Falls\ntrailhead inside the Potwisha campground, it's an unmarked road that\nbranches off site #14. If that is full, you can park across the road\nfrom Potwisha campground, at the overflow parking (where rangers used to\nallow people to camp for free when the campground was full, but now if\nthey see you they may threat to cite you if you stay overnight).</p>\n<p>From Potwisha drive north on General's Highway and park on the last\nturnout before Crystal Cave Rd (shown on the map). From the parking spot\nhike downhill northhwest cross-country generally following the\nridgeline, which will require mild bushwhacking. Follow the ridge to the\npoint where a small, unnamed drainage meets the Marble Fork Kaweah\nRiver, the checkpoint for the water flow. If you are not careful, you\nmay drop into the creek earlier, missing the checkpoint, which is\ntotally fine as long as you are sure the water levels are not too\nhigh.</p>\n<h3 id=\"sneak\">Sneak</h3>\n<p>From Potwisha drive north on General's Highway and park on the\noverlook turnout at 36.551480, -118.787560. From the brown sign that\nsays \"Eleven Range Overlook\" head down the steep earthen slope around\nthe big deadfall tree, then angle left 200 feet into a shallow gully\nwith nearly zero bushwhacking, down about 1000 feet to a junction of\nanother gully. Just before reaching the junction traverse right and\nslightly up to reach the other gully. From here you will need to\n<strong>rappel 50 feet</strong> from a large bush / tree with a webbing\nanchor. Below that rappel, go DCL through a low cut \"garden of poison\noak\" and use a super long bush branch (or handline off the bush) down an\nextremely steep earthen slope for 30 feet. Beyond it's easy to walk down\nrocks for a bit then go DCR on a steep earthen slope hugging thick brush\non your left, reaching a point to drop off the slope back to the gully\nbottom. Beyond is a traverse DCR up out of the water course to a rock\npinch point (rocky cliff face on right with a lot of poison oak all\naround); from this pinch point rappel about 30 feet, or carefully\ndownclimb the earthen slope to the 10 foot dropoff angling left to a\nledge. Beyond another rappel that can be ghosted off a good sized tree\nwith many low and large branches, or bypass by climbing up DCL on the\nrock slab and down the steep earthen slope. More easy slab downclimbing\nfollows before getting to a large tree with a huge horizontal limb just\nabove the big drop down a marble face into the Marble Fork creek itself.\nFrom the big tree it's about 240 feet to the water. 40 feet below that\nlarge tree is an easily accessible ledge (by downclimbing) with a\nsizable dead tree (still OK for anchor as of Aug 2021) or a reasonable\nsize bush. <strong>Rappel 192 feet</strong> from the dead tree to the\nwater with 6 foot webbing anchor. If you rappel slightly off plumb in\nthe Marble Fork downstream direction (Down Gully Left, or your right\nfacing the cliff) you can easily reach a large rock to avoid rappelling\ninto the water. If you rappel plumb down the amazingly white marble\nface, you will go into the water; the pool is shallow in the area, and\nit's a good idea to rinse off poison oak oil in the water anyway. From\nthis touchdown pool there are various downclimbs options to the lower\npool and the main rappel sequence starts (R2) on the other side of this\nlower pool.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>The original descent described in SierraCanyons.org is OUTDATED, so\nplease follow the description listed below instead.</p>\n<p>From the checkpoint proceed downstream. The first rappel is\nbypassable and there is quite a slog to reach the second rappel, so most\npeople will prefer to delay suiting up till they get to the watery\nhallway above R2.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>R1</strong>: 20 feet from a large dead log DCR. You can stay\nout of the water and bypass this rappel, downclimbing the falls DCL or\nusing the game trails DCR.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>From here the river scramble continues and seems to get a bit easier.\nMore importantly, marble starts to appear, first as single isolated\nblocks. Soon, you reach a section of canyon with towering walls on the\nDCR. Closer inspection reveals that the walls are composed of marble!\nThe Marble blocks in the watercourse get more numerous and whiter in\ncolor. Just when you are starting to think that this marble is cool but\nwhen is the canyon going to steepen up you reach an amazing place. The\ncanyon makes a sharp turn to the right under towering walls and cascades\ninto a marble hallway. Suddenly everything is white in a long straight\nwatery corridor. Downclimb through the cascades and swim though the\nhallway (wetsuit required at this point and thereafter). Itâ€™s magical.\nFrom the end of the hallway a few more downclimbs on the DCR over\nsurreal blocks of marble lead to an emerald green pool and the beginning\nof the technical section. The sneak approach drops into this pool down\nthe huge marble face on the left. From this pool you can clearly sense\nthe canyon falling away just beyond. Swim the pool and get ready for the\naction.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>R2</strong>: 120 feet from a boulder pinch point DCL in the\ncorner. This low angle rappel heads DCR into the watercourse and over\nledges to a small alcove tucked above a large falls. The rock is super\nslippery here, so downclimbing unroped is not advisable. There is rock\nfall danger here so be careful.</li>\n<li><strong>R3</strong>: Dual stage. 50 feet from a chokestone DCR in\nthe back of the small alcove all the way to the top of the waterfall.\nThen 110 feet from a (was webbing-less? Aug 2020: now only standard\nsport climbing hangers on 1/2\" SS stud bolts remain with one hanger bent\nslightly) dual bolt anchor right behind the rocky nose.\n<span style=\"color:red\">As of September 2016 the nose has been bolted\nand no longer requires extending the alcove anchor all the way to the\nedge of the nose. Note: winter floods will rip the webbing off the\nbolts, and may damage the bolts and or hangers, so be prepared!</span>\nNote this rappel is a single drop down through the stair-stepped teeth\nof a large falls into a curving slot and into an amazing pool. This rap\nis intense and one of the hallmarks of the route, but <strong>in high\nwater this is the most dangerous drop of the whole descent</strong>, as\nthe slot constriction will concentrate the flow which may pin the\nrappeller. In high water it is essential to set the rope length properly\nto provide an easy floating disconnect and rappel without packs in order\nto avoid possible entanglements with the hydraulics at the bottom.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>R4</strong>: 100 feet from 2 bolts DCL. This is a single\ndrop into a pool that meets a falls about halfway down. Set the rope\nlength or be prepared for a floating disconnect. Continue\ndowncanyon.</li>\n<li><strong>R5</strong>: 60 feet from 2 bolts DCL that are a little\ndifficult to locate as they are up on a ledge about 10 feet above the\nwatercourse. This is a single drop that leads into another incredible\nhanging pool. Set the rope length or be prepared for a floating\ndisconnect. Look for the canyon register on a ledge above the ledge with\nthe anchor. It's in an ammo can, please sign it.</li>\n<li><strong>R6</strong>: 90 feet from 2 bolts DCR. This is a single drop\nbeside a falls and into a pool. This is a single drop that can go either\nto the side of or through a curtain falls. Going through the falls\nreveals that the line of rappel is actually behind the falls, a\nspectacular experience! Set the rope length or be prepared for a\nfloating disconnect. Swim the pool at the bottom of rap 6 and upclimb on\nslabs on the RIGHT (DCR).</li>\n<li><strong>R7</strong>: 90 feet from a chokestone DCL. This is a single\ndrop that leads to the edge of a pool. Scramble and downclimb downcanyon\non the right (DCR) through large blocks a short ways. When you reach\nwhat appears to be a large falls look for the next rap anchors from a\ntree on the right.</li>\n<li><strong>R8-R9</strong>: It is possible to do these two drops as one\nsingle rappel using a tree anchor DCR. In this case, the last person\nshould stay high and mostly out of the water DCR to make the rope pull\neasier, or throw down the bag with the pull line on the pool below and\nthen rappel in the watercourse. In high water R9 may become dangerous,\nif too intense for your skill level bypass it by joining with R8 and rap\nout of the watercourse.\n<ul>\n<li><strong>R8</strong>: 25 feet from a tree DCR that gets you on a\nledge next to the falls. You can continue the rappel off this anchor by\nclimbing on the rock DCR and avoiding R9 (recommended for high flow).\nAlso, R8 can be done DCL off a pinch point into the brunt of the water\nflow, then dropping underneath it. Doing it this way is the \"spout\"\nrappel.</li>\n<li><strong>R9</strong>: 60 feet from a slung boulder DCL just above the\nslanting ledge. This is a double drop that goes first to a shallow\nwatery ledge that a falls is crashing onto and then descends through a\nlower falls to the pool below. Set the rope length or be prepared for a\nfloating disconnect. This is another exciting rappel. <strong>the pool\nat the bottom has rocks that create a backflow hydraulic; high flow may\nmake this hard to escape!</strong></li>\n</ul></li>\n<li><strong>R10</strong>: 90 feet from a boulder DCR on a ledge about 15\nfeet above the watercourse. This is a single drop that descends beside a\nlovely slab falls. Upclimb a short wall at the base of rap 10 and\ndownclimb the other side to rejoin the watercourse. Scramble down canyon\na short distance. When the watercouse starts to funnel down again and\nmarble reappears exit the watercourse DCL and climb over slabs to the\nfinal obstacle of the route.</li>\n<li><strong>Jump 1</strong>: 30 feet from ledges DCL to a fantastic pool\nframed in marble. This is a magical end to a magical route but should be\napproached with caution. The jump area has both an upper and lower\nledge. The upper ledge is 30 feet above the pool and the lower ledge is\n20 feet above the pool. Beware the pool below is not as deep as it\nlooks. In 2015 it was a mere 6 feet deep in the landing area and people\ntouched sandy bottom when L-jumping from the lower ledge. So be sure to\nsend a canyoneer down on a rope to check the depth of the pool. Also,\nthis can be climbed around through the brush DCL, so repeats can be\ndone.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>From the last pool, it is still 3.2 miles of hiking back to Potwisha\ncampground. The trail is easy to miss. Continue scrambling downstream\nmaking your way to the left (DCL) side of the watercourse. Following\nhard DCL, you'll come upon a fairly long marble vein just at the top of\na idyllic swimming pool with a waterfall cascading down into it and\nbeyond (Marble Falls Pool). From here you should see a pack of trees DCL\naround your elevation, proceed there and traverse the ledges to the\nMarble Fork Trail, at the beginning it does not look like much but as\nsoon as you turn the corner you will find a well defined trail.</p>\n<h2 id=\"lower_marble_fork\">Lower Marble Fork</h2>\n<p>If you get to the Marble Fork Trail, still have 3-4 hours of\ndaylight, and don't mind a good bit of boulder hopping, the lower\nsection of canyon is well worth descending. Early on you'll find a few\ngood jumps, and an awesome rappel (~130 feet into a cool kind of\nchamber). Rappelling off a boulder on the left of these falls, you can\nhit a ledge about 30 feet up, then huck yourself the rest of the way.\nBelow here the canyon mellows out, with a few little jumps and fun\nthings. Where the canyon gets steep again, it is unfortunately less\nexciting. You could rappel off a tree, or find a 3rd class bypass route\naround on the left.</p>\n<p>It's mostly boulder hopping down from there, with occasional pools.\nEventually you'll see the water diversion into the canal on the left,\nwhich you can walk out through to exit.</p>\n<h3 id=\"marble_fork_caves\">Marble Fork Caves</h3>\n<p>Before you head out, if you have time and are so inclined, you may\nexplore some of the caves in the area. Pasted from &lt;<a\nhref=\"https://www.nps.gov/seki/learn/nature/cave_descriptions.htm\">https://www.nps.gov/seki/learn/nature/cave_descriptions.htm</a>&gt;:\nEighteen caves have been discovered in an area where the Marble Fork of\nthe Kaweah River cuts through several large lenses of marble. Some of\nthe area's caves are dry, fossil passages, while others are active\nstream caves. Two caves in the area, capture the river's water and\nchannel it into their passages. The largest cave along this stretch of\nriver, Wild Child Cave, was discovered in 1992. For much of the year\nthis young, high-energy cave is flooded. During low-water Wild Child's\nlarge walking passages, waterfalls and stream channels can be explored.\nMarble Falls Cave was discovered by the first park superintendent,\nWalter Fry. This cave's complex, stream-polished passages are also\neasiest to explore during low water.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Beta was originally posted on sierracanyons.org (now defunct), <a\nhref=\"Media:Chrysalis.pdf\" title=\"wikilink\">Open PDF</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/124082473\">Video featuring the first\ndescent</a></li>\n<li><a\nhref=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/55452339@N00/sets/72157601613396392/\">Pictures\nfrom 2007 - first descent</a></li>\n<li><a\nhref=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/madzoy/sets/72157606681578832/\">Pictures\nfrom 2008 - dangerously high flow mentioned in the beta</a></li>\n<li><a\nhref=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/55452339@N00/2752816710/in/set-72157606667909488/\">More\nPictures from 2008 - dangerously high flow mentioned in the\nbeta</a></li>\n<li><a\nhref=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/madzoy/sets/72157631940909979/\">Pictures\nfrom 2012 - normal flow</a></li>\n<li><a\nhref=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/55452339@N00/8089056641/in/set-72157631772797094\">More\nPictures from 2012 - normal flow</a></li>\n<li><a\nhref=\"https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.10153555472096103.1073742067.669366102&amp;type=1&amp;l=440c0a1d56\">Pictures\nfrom 2015 - very high flow</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n<p>Much of the content on this page is originally from information\nposted on sierracanyons.org, used under a Creative Commons license.</p>\n",
