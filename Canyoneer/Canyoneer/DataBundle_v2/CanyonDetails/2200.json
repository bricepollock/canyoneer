  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><ul>\n<li>** the land manager, Carlo Abbruzzese, wants us to pause on running\nthese creeks until he can get out there and see whatâ€™s happening and how\nit happens. He is aware of the general public using the area and is\naware of the various trails being built (he is not keen on). Ryan E\nplans on hiking the area with him in March 2023 to educate him on what\nwe do and to receive more information from him in DNR NAP (natural area\npreservation) sites. These site are as close to wilderness as it gets\nand the state would like to keep it that way. There are a number of very\nspecific flowers and plants that reside in the area and they would be\ndisappointed if any invasives were introduced. Here is more info on his\nwork and why it is important to us all.</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul>\n<p>A little-known creek close-in to Portland. The creek has two nice\nwaterfalls (one of them being over 200ft high), but they're a fair\ndistance apart. Expect to spend most of your time creek-walking and\nbushwhacking -- sometimes both at once for long stretches -- making this\none a somewhat high pay-to-play. The big falls can be run by itself\nrelatively easily, although hiking in for a single waterfall may not be\nworth your time.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Watershed: 0.3mi^2.</li>\n<li>The checkpoint for Gable is along the road you drive in on to the\ntrailhead.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>Park at the end of the county road. Walk up past a gate into High\nValley (former hippie commune in the 1980's; land is now owned by the\nForest Service). Turn left immediately on a trail and follow it up onto\nthe ridge. Keep going up. At about 900ft elevation, bear left on an old\nlogging grade and drop down to the creek above the upper falls.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>There are a great many informal trails in the Gable Creek drainage.\nIt's easy to become lost. Bring a map &amp; GPS-capable device.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>Gable Creek reduces to a trickle in the summer months, and, as a\nresult, it's completely overgrown in some areas. Expect serious\nbushwhacking... sometimes bushwhacking while wading in the creek (aka\n\"splash-whacking\"). A machete might be useful.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>R1: 40'. Check out the neat cave-like space below the falls. It's\nbigger than it looks.</li>\n<li>35ft drop choked with vegetation. Bypass DCL or, if in need of\npunishment, rappel.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There used to be an old trail DCL above the creek, but there's not\nmuch left of it. As of 2022, it was faint and hard to follow. Thrash,\nbushwhack, scrabble, wade, and squelch your way downstream.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>R2: <strong>Gable Falls</strong> -- High water: ~240ft from a tree\nhigh DCR. Rappel over a knob about 10ft above the brink; this will act\nas a natural redirect and keep you out of the main flow. Low water:\n~210ft(?) from a small tree DCL just above the brink. Take special\nprecautions to protect your rope as the top of the falls has sharp edges\nand lots of loose rock (especially if rappelling out of the flow). Do\nnot belay or linger right at the foot of the falls -- anyone in this\narea may be at high risk of getting struck by rockfall.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There is one more 10ft drop downstream, but it's probably not worth\nyour time. Most parties will exit after R2.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>After the last rappel, follow the trail back to the ridge. Do not\nkeep going down the creek or you'll end out in someone's backyard.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<p>Traditionally the Gable Creek area has been open to access, but\ndespite the trail network, it lies inside the Columbia Falls Natural\nArea Preserve which is managed by the Washington State Department of\nNatural Resources (DNR). Please respect all postings as access could be\nrevoked at any time.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Archer Valley (next valley to the east) is closed to public entry to\nprotect several endangered plant and animal species.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><img src=\"rwl_en.png\" title=\"rwl_en.png\" alt=\"rwl_en.png\" /><a\nhref=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20210527212206/www.canyoneeringnorthwest.com/GableCreek/Gable_Creek.php\">CanyoneeringNorthwest.com\n(archive.org)</a> : Gable Creek</li>\n<li><img src=\"rwl_en.png\" title=\"rwl_en.png\" alt=\"rwl_en.png\" /><a\nhref=\"http://ropewiki.com/User:Super_Amazing_Map?id=Gable_Creek_-_Washington\">Super\nAmazing Map</a> : Gable Creek</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<p><a\nhref=\"https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=UbnXmUXWGBo&amp;t=4s\">https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=UbnXmUXWGBo&amp;t=4s</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n<p>Gable was probably first descended by Evan Topinka in Sept 2008.</p>\n",
