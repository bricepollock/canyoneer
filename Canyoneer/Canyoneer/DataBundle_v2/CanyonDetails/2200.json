{"description":"<div class=\"mw-content-ltr mw-parser-output\" lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><ul><li><ul><li>** the land manager, Carlo Abbruzzese, wants us to pause on running these creeks until he can get out there and see what’s happening and how it happens. He is aware of the general public using the area and is aware of the various trails being built (he is not keen on). Ryan E plans on hiking the area with him in March 2023 to educate him on what we do and to receive more information from him in DNR NAP (natural area preservation) sites. These site are as close to wilderness as it gets and the state would like to keep it that way. There are a number of very specific flowers and plants that reside in the area and they would be disappointed if any invasives were introduced. Here is more info on his work and why it is important to us all.<\/li><\/ul><\/li><\/ul>\n<p><br \/>\n<\/p><p>A little-known creek close-in to Portland.  The creek has two nice waterfalls (one of them being over 200ft high), but they're a fair distance apart. Expect to spend most of your time creek-walking and bushwhacking -- sometimes both at once for long stretches -- making this one a somewhat high pay-to-play. The big falls can be run by itself relatively easily, although hiking in for a single waterfall may not be worth your time.\n<\/p>\n<ul><li>Watershed: 0.3mi^2.<\/li>\n<li>The checkpoint for Gable is along the road you drive in on to the trailhead.<\/li><\/ul>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Park at the end of the county road.  Walk up past a gate into High Valley (former hippie commune in the 1980's; land is now owned by the Forest Service). Turn left immediately on a trail and follow it up onto the ridge.  Keep going up.  At about 900ft elevation, bear left on an old logging grade and drop down to the creek above the upper falls.\n<\/p>\n<ul><li>There are a great many informal trails in the Gable Creek drainage. It's easy to become lost. Bring a map &amp; GPS-capable device.<\/li><\/ul>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Gable Creek reduces to a trickle in the summer months, and, as a result, it's completely overgrown in some areas. Expect serious bushwhacking... sometimes bushwhacking while wading in the creek (aka \"splash-whacking\"). A machete might be useful.\n<\/p>\n<ul><li>R1: 40'. Check out the neat cave-like space below the falls. It's bigger than it looks.<\/li>\n<li>35ft drop choked with vegetation. Bypass DCL or, if in need of punishment, rappel.<\/li><\/ul>\n<p>There used to be an old trail DCL above the creek, but there's not much left of it. As of 2022, it was faint and hard to follow.  Thrash, bushwhack, scrabble, wade, and squelch your way downstream.\n<\/p>\n<ul><li>R2: <b>Gable Falls<\/b> -- High water: ~240ft from a tree high DCR.  Rappel over a knob about 10ft above the brink; this will act as a natural redirect and keep you out of the main flow.  Low water: ~210ft(?) from a small tree DCL just above the brink.  Take special precautions to protect your rope as the top of the falls has sharp edges and lots of loose rock (especially if rappelling out of the flow).  Do not belay or linger right at the foot of the falls -- anyone in this area may be at high risk of getting struck by rockfall.<\/li><\/ul>\n<p>There is one more 10ft drop downstream, but it's probably not worth your time. Most parties will exit after R2.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>After the last rappel, follow the trail back to the ridge.  Do not keep going down the creek or you'll end out in someone's backyard.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Red_tape\">Red tape<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Traditionally the Gable Creek area has been open to access, but despite the trail network, it lies inside the Columbia Falls Natural Area Preserve which is managed by the Washington State Department of Natural Resources (DNR).
