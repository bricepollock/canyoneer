  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>Almost more of a collection of sweet swimming holes than a\ncanyoneering trip, but the initial gorge and everything on the way down\nmake it a worthwhile route. Without ropes, you will need to make a ~25\nfoot high jump off of a fairly slippery rock, but it isn't hard.</p>\n<p>Also note that this tends to have a lot of water in it. If you look\nat this gauge, I think maybe 2/3 of the water is coming from the Middle\nFork (guessing, and barring any localized storms). Based on that, 70 cfs\ntakes some negotiation through the gorge in particular. Anything over\n100 cfs would probably start causing serious problems.</p>\n<p>Wetsuits should not be needed on hot summer days. The people at the\nbottom would probably look at you funny.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>Note that the shuttle is only 1 mile long, so walking would be pretty\nsimple.</p>\n<p>Drive into the park and pass Potwisha Campground. Park at the first\nopen turnout on the right you get to. If they are all full, and you're\ntrying to minimize walking, you can turn around and park at the Potwisha\ntrailhead on the south side of the road from the campground.</p>\n<p>Take your other car (or walk) up the road. In a mile there is a\nslightly larger turnout on the right with rock walls on the side at the\nbottom of the hill.</p>\n<p>Instead of taking the crappy path out of the middle of this pullout,\nwalk just past the pullout and take a much nicer trail down to the\nriver. Head downstream from here.</p>\n<p>Pretty quickly you enter a nice gorge. There's an easy jump off a\nrock here, and then mostly walking and swimming out of it.</p>\n<p>The canyon opens up as you turn right, then slowly closes back in,\nuntil you reach a fairly large drop with a big boulder in the middle.\nJumping right off of it seems to be the best approach, which requires\nstepping onto the very slippery edge. At very low water you might be\nable to slide in on the left, but it looks like you would get pretty\nstuck in an eddy at higher flows.</p>\n<p>Downstream things open up a bit again as you make your way down. The\nnext substantial waterfall is kind of interesting. Below it is 75%\nwalled off ahead and on the left. The water is white and foamy, circles\nback in on itself, and doesn't appear to feed out anywhere, except maybe\nsomewhere well under the surface. Not somewhere you want to end up.\nThere's not really anywhere good to jump off the right side, so the\njumping option is from the left side, over the waterfall into the pool\non the right. It's super fun, but scary, and probably not the smartest\nidea.</p>\n<p>Not far downstream from here you'll see the flume start at a big\nwall. It goes off to the left. Take it for a bit if you want, but climb\nback in before the bridge starts. Just downstream you'll hit a really\nawesome swimming hole, probably with lots of other people hanging out.\nLeave your pack at the top of the drop, as you have to hike back up\nanyway.</p>\n<p>This swimming hole has a really fun slide. You can start pretty high,\ngetting in from the left right where the water crashes into a big wall\nif you don't mind a bumpy ride. A better idea is to start lower from the\nright and slide into the current. There are also numerous options for\njumping off of cliffs into the deep pool.</p>\n<p>Once you're finished, climb up on a conveniently placed stick to get\nonto the face and to a trail on the right, and take the social trails\nback up to the road and your car.</p>\n<p>Or, if you ended up leaving a car at the Potwisha trailhead, climb up\nto the flume on the left, take it down to trails on the right, across\nthe suspension bridge and back to your car.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>retty quickly you enter a nice gorge.
