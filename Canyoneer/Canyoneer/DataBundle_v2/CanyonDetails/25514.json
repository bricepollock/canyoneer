From this switchback, immediately at its 180 degree bend you will see a bit of a clearing in the brush on the uphill dirt wall.  Climb up directly between the bushes into the clearing.  From there following the clearing around the slope to a cut path that alternately traverses and goes very steeply down earthen slopes.  In about 100 yards you will be in the canyon proper at 34.18072, -118.05779\n<\/p><p><b>Full:<\/b> Most likely not worth it!  Mega Bushwhacking\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p><b>Sneak:<\/b>  Bypasses <b>R1<\/b> given in Matt Maxon's beta and travels the canyon with brush pruned back 27JAN2019.  Surprisingly, the only poison oak is one sizable bush after R6, which can be avoided, and bunches of it after R7 on the shelf RDC before R8. \n<\/p><p><b>R2:<\/b> 20 feet from bush LDC dark red webbing anchor.\n<\/p><p><b>R3:<\/b> 100 feet, low angle, low brush covered, from a bush high RDC.  When you get to a rounded trough (can be down-climbed about 10 feet), swing out right onto the slab and you will find the black webbing anchor end.  From this side (out of the trough) it is a straight shot to the bottom of this low angle working over some small brush, mostly between the brush.  If you down-climb the trough, then realize you have gone too far, there is a bush midway LDC that can be used for an anchor, but getting to it is a bit sketchy with poor footing.\n<\/p><p><b>R4:<\/b> 100 feet, two stage rappel around a slight bend, rope anchor off a bush high RDC.  Rope pull is fine even with the bend between stages.\n<\/p><p><b>R5:<\/b> 300 feet from bush RDC with long black webbing anchor as of 31MAY2019.  The quick-link is 10 feet over the drop lip RDC on the rock slab, which makes the rope pull doable 300 feet below, but getting to the quick-link more difficult.  The blue webbing anchor (on the same bush) provides a courtesy rappel anchor for the last person to rappel to the main anchor.  This rappel goes about 125 feet down (from the long anchor extension) a blocky slab into a filled pothole (end of R5A), then steep for 155 feet (overhanging for 80 feet) and touches down to a scree slope RDC.  An 80 meter rope (270 feet) will just reach (using the long anchor extension).  <b>NOTE:<\/b> the R5 anchor webbing goes over a very crumbly slope of dirt and small rocks, so be careful not to knock rocks down onto your partners, even though the slaby shape of this rappel tends to catch dislodged rocks.\n<\/p><p><b>R5B:<\/b> 155 feet from 2 bushes and 2 pitons.  About 125 feet down R5 is a filled pothole (end of R5A) with 2 pitons LDC, and a granite colored rope connected to 2 bushes 20 feet up. This fixed rope extends well over the drop and a connection point between the rope (alpine butterfly) and the webbing from the pitons provides a courtesy rappel point at 155 feet off the scree field below.  Rope pull from the courtesy rappel point should be OK, but has not been tested.  NOTE: As set 31MAY2019 the courtesy rappel quick link's position causes the rope fed through it to be pinched when hanging from the extended anchor point; so either add some extension and another quick-link or reset the rope to webbing connection position, if the last person is using the extended rappel point.   From the main anchor extension, it's about 140 feet to the scree field at the bottom.  <b>NOTE:<\/b> there are many very loose rocks on this rappel, so anyone already down should get well out of the way!  Get back when pulling your rope too!\n<\/p><p><b>R6:<\/b> Is a down-climb on a series of ledges with much dirt and scree.  There is a perfectly placed bush right at the top that could be used for rappel (no anchor as of 31MAY2019)\n<\/p><p><b>R7:<\/b> 10 feet from a bush LDC (no webbing anchor as of 31MAY2019)\n<\/p><p>The canyon below this point gets much wider and has tons of grass the grows in the springs, dies and then has seeds that stick in your shoes.  There is also bunches of poison oak that grows mixed into other plants.\n<\/p><p><b>R8:<\/b> down-climb the steel ladder on the concrete slat wall of the catch basin.\n<\/p><p><br \/>\n<b>Full:<\/b>\n<\/p><p>Adds one more chossy rappel (<b>R1<\/b>) and much travel in a canyon choked full of bush and deadfall.
