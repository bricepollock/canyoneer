There is an upper ramp about 70ft tall and 100ft long that is pretty to look at. I marked it on the map and can be a gauge of the flow. If you cross the bridge there is a little spot to park and a boot path down the bank to the top. If you walk the road further downstream there is a boot path to the bottom as well. \n<\/p><p>The lower canyon is rather scenic with some smooth bedrock and moss carpet. R1 is part of a long cliff band with a undercut section DCR of the falls. It would be interesting to see this area at higher flow as the chest deep pool at the base of R1 could be a hydraulic and R3 would be quite pushy.\n<\/p><p>Not really a destination of it's own, but if in the area and\/or passing through looking for a quick fix, I think it's worth a rip.\\\n<\/p>\n<ul><li>Watershed: 1.1mi^2.<\/li><\/ul>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Follow Hwy 6 from Portland and turn off onto Larch Mountain \/ Drift Creek Rd, cross the bridge and turn left. There is a new large parking lot on the right which is a good place to drop some cars\/carpool. Follow the road for 1.4 miles and make a sharp left turn onto a side road. Follow this road to the end and park. Suit up here. Walk back up the road about 800 feet to a small saddle and find a good place to head off left into the bushes. It's brushy at first but push on through, shortly after it gets steep you should cross a well travelled game trail, follow this to the bottom. Total hike takes about 10 min. Walk a short distance downstream to the top of R1.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p><b>R1:<\/b> 45ft drop, tree anchor DCL back from the lip into chest deep pot hole at the bottom that could be interesting at high flow.

This is a good place to remove your gear, and unzip your wetsuit. What follows is a 550 ft climb out DCL. In places are there are game trails to follow but they end up taking you a little further downstream. Find whatever is the easiest way up. The bushes get a little thicker at the top but sticker bushes are a minimum. Once you reach the ridge there will be an old road grade. Follow it north with some more bushwhacking back to your car.\n<\/p><p>It looks like you may be able to exit DCL shortly after R3.
