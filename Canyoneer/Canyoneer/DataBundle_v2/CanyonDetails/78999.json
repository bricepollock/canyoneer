  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>The short lower canyon on Game Hog Creek has been on my list to check\nout for awhile. There is an upper ramp about 70ft tall and 100ft long\nthat is pretty to look at. I marked it on the map and can be a gauge of\nthe flow. If you cross the bridge there is a little spot to park and a\nboot path down the bank to the top. If you walk the road further\ndownstream there is a boot path to the bottom as well.</p>\n<p>The lower canyon is rather scenic with some smooth bedrock and moss\ncarpet. R1 is part of a long cliff band with a undercut section DCR of\nthe falls. It would be interesting to see this area at higher flow as\nthe chest deep pool at the base of R1 could be a hydraulic and R3 would\nbe quite pushy.</p>\n<p>Not really a destination of it's own, but if in the area and/or\npassing through looking for a quick fix, I think it's worth a rip.\\</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Watershed: 1.1mi^2.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>Follow Hwy 6 from Portland and turn off onto Larch Mountain / Drift\nCreek Rd, cross the bridge and turn left. There is a new large parking\nlot on the right which is a good place to drop some cars/carpool. Follow\nthe road for 1.4 miles and make a sharp left turn onto a side road.\nFollow this road to the end and park. Suit up here. Walk back up the\nroad about 800 feet to a small saddle and find a good place to head off\nleft into the bushes. It's brushy at first but push on through, shortly\nafter it gets steep you should cross a well travelled game trail, follow\nthis to the bottom. Total hike takes about 10 min. Walk a short distance\ndownstream to the top of R1.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p><strong>R1:</strong> 45ft drop, tree anchor DCL back from the lip\ninto chest deep pot hole at the bottom that could be interesting at high\nflow. At lower flow you can land on the smooth bed rock DCL and walk\nout.</p>\n<p><strong>R2:</strong> 20ft drop, tree anchor DCL back from the lip</p>\n<p><font color=\"red\"><strong>Warning:</strong> there is a v-shaped slot\nin the rock on the edge of a small pool before the lip that will catch a\nblock. We used a tied two-ring runner and it got caught, pic below.\nThankfully there is a log pile DCL that we were able to climb up and\nretrieve. </font></p>\n<p><strong>R3:</strong> 30ft drop, placed webbing on tree DCR at the\nlip. Large log in the middle of the drop</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>Below R3, follow the creek downstream for about 1/4 mile to a small\ncascade down a narrow slot in the bedrock. This is a good place to\nremove your gear, and unzip your wetsuit. What follows is a 550 ft climb\nout DCL. In places are there are game trails to follow but they end up\ntaking you a little further downstream. Find whatever is the easiest way\nup. The bushes get a little thicker at the top but sticker bushes are a\nminimum. Once you reach the ridge there will be an old road grade.\nFollow it north with some more bushwhacking back to your car.</p>\n<p>It looks like you may be able to exit DCL shortly after R3. Looking\nat lidar it may cliff out at the top, so we took the longer/easier route\ndownstream.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<p>None</p>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n<p>There were remnants of visitors as well as previous logging activity.\nThe upper ramp was descended by Portland locals April 17th, 2021. For\nthese purposes I will say the lower canyon was first descended May 27th,\n2023 by Clint Clow, Wade Hewitt, and Elisabeth Bishop.</p>\n",
