Though the narrows are relatively shallow, they are diverse and scenic with a few fun elevator downclimbs and some easy, low exposure high-stemming.  Knee pads recommended.   \n<\/p><p>The launching off point for the trip is Lone Rock beach in very southern Utah at the western end of the lake.  Drive east from highway 89 just north of the Arizona\/Utah border on Lone Rock Road to the beach and primitive camping area at the end of the road.  Though the northern end of the beach is mostly gravel, this area is the first to fill up with campers on this popular beach.  The farther south you go, the deeper the sand gets; four wheel drive required.\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>I am sure there is more than one way to get to the head of the canyon, I will simply describe how I got there.  \nFrom the beach, paddle north passing Lone Rock along the way for about two miles to reach the mouth of the canyon which is easy to identify as the only slot to the east.  Paddle up the slot a short ways to pull out on a sandy embankment on either side of the canyon to hike directly up the canyon.  A break that can be climbed up can be found a short distance up canyon on the right that is a relatively low angle crack that goes at class 3, some may wish for a rope to assist with the climb.  Once on top, hike northeast on slickrock, in washes and on any minor game trails you may find to avoid hiking on the cryptobiotic soil that is prevalent in the area as best you can.  Continue around a few minor drainages until you come up against a promontory with another minor tributary drainage right before it.  I hiked down to, then around this minor drainage to the north, then was quickly cliffed out and found a small chute with a short drop at its end to drop into the canyon.  I rappelled the eight foot drop off of a hook (a body belay and a spot from below also works) since it looked just tall enough to hurt if you just dropped straight down.  Cross the canyon going slightly up to climb out again on the other side (20 feet) to gain the cliffs above to continue hiking up canyon, now on its north side.  Another .5 miles of hiking will bring you to the beginning of the slot.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>The slot begins with a fun 25 foot elevator downclimb; though if you don't like the looks of it you can hike right around it on the left.  The canyon opens and narrows several times along its two mile length; along the way you will encounter some easy, low exposure stemming and one more elevator downclimb of about 20 feet into a short, tight narrows.  Farther down canyon is the one rappel of 15 feet at a log jam.  I simply wrapped the rope around the log for an anchor, being careful not to place it where it could get stuck when pulling from below.  Another nice narrows and some hiking will bring you back to your boat and the lake.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Return the way you came.  Those looking for a spot to camp on the lake can do so by paddling north up the main arm of Lone Rock Canyon a short ways to find a good beach on the left that is fairly quiet compared to the party scene on Lone Rock Beach.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Red_tape\">Red tape<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Lone Rock beach requires a fee of $14 per day, per vehicle to stay or park at the campground.  Since the campground is administered by the National Park Service, an interagency pass will cover it as well.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Beta_sites\">Beta
