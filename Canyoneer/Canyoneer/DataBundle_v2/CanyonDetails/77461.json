It has two significant tiers visible from the trail as well as 2-3 drops above. It flows all year round, but reduces significantly in volume heading into the summer. The creek itself, other than the waterfalls, is a total mess of deadfall, scree and bushes. The two lower drops are excellent but the pay to play is rather high. \n<\/p>\n<ul><li>Watershed: 0.26mi^2. The highest point of the drainage is about 3700ft.<\/li><\/ul>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Park at the Herman Creek trailhead and hike in from there.  \n<\/p>\n<ul><li>Follow the Herman Creek trail for 1.7mi (900ft gain) to a junction with the PCT.<\/li>\n<li>(Optional) Detour west on the PCT for 0.75mi RT (150ft gain) to check the waterflow.<\/li>\n<li>Bushwhack south up to a saddle (45.66721, -121.83941) and down the far side to drop into PCT creek (talus field) into the drainage above the slot (0.5mi, 1150ft gain).<\/li><\/ul>\n<p>The majority of the approach distance is on trail, but the majority of the elevation gain comes in the last off trail section where you gain nearly 1,200' in a 1\/3 of a mile with lots of scree, ticks and poison oak. Some sections get steep enough that it's almost like crawling. Once you reach the saddle the views are fantastic, but then you have to descend nearly 600' down a scree field down to the creek.\n<\/p><p>Getting to the upper falls from this route requires an additional traverse upstream. Conversely, you could take PCT around and descend down from above the upper drops but, this adds mileage and additional elevation. (Unexplored)\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>(This is only describing the lower two waterfalls, not the ones higher up the creek) Normally the fun starts when you hit the creek, but not with this one. Once you hit the creek the bushwhacking continues. The creek is overgrown and full of deadfall, with loose unstable scree banks. No need to put on a wetsuit for the thrash. The fun continues until you get to the top of the first waterfall. There is a nice area to change into wetsuits at the top of the drop. You can see down the entire slot down to PCT. Be aware that there is a massive chock stone at the top that looks like it's part of the ledge. It's totally stable but open on the front and back.\n<\/p>\n<ul><li>R1: ~130' anchored from a tree in the middle of the creek. There are several trees in the waterfall but they are all easily avoided. The bottom has several trees that hide how far back the slot really goes. The pull from the bottom risks getting your rope stuck so a rebelay is recommended for the last one or two down. The view down the slot is amazing.\n<ul><li>Rebelay on the root ball about 50' down. From here a 200' rope will get you down and the pull is good.<\/li><\/ul><\/li><\/ul>\n<ul><li>R2: 90' from a tree DCL. The drop is blocky with water on all sides.<\/li><\/ul>\n<p>After R2 scramble down the creek to PCT. It's not far, but like the rest of the creek it's a mess.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Follow the PCT east for 0.35mi to the junction and return the way you came.
