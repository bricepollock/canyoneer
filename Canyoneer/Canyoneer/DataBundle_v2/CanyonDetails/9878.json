From there you can drive or walk to the drop in. It's a 6.6 mile drive or hike to the drop in point. From Grotto Falls, drive NF-150 to NF-2703. Turn left on NF-2703. After 4 miles turn left on NF-750. Then take your second left on NF-4711. Drive this road till you come to a large marsh and cross over a large culvert.

NONE OF THIS ROUTE HAS ESTABLISHED ANCHORS. Some problem solving is required when using a single 60m rope, I recommend rappelling DCL for the first 90  foot waterfall off a tree near the cliff edge and DCR for 'Grotto Falls' off a large Western Cedar. The tree at Grotto Falls is set right against the cliff. All other rappels have a variety of anchors.\n<\/p>\n<style data-mw-deduplicate=\"TemplateStyles:r1062633282\">@media all and (max-width:720px){.mw-parser-output .content .thumb>div:not(.thumbinner){display:flex;justify-content:center;flex-wrap:wrap;align-content:flex-start;flex-direction:column}}body.skin-vector .mw-parser-output div.thumb>div:not(.thumbinner){font-size:94%;text-align:center;overflow:hidden;min-width:100px}body.skin-minerva .mw-parser-output div.thumb>div:not(.thumbinner){margin:0 auto;max-width:100%!important}<\/style> \n<div class=\"thumb tright\">\n<div style=\"display:table;\">\n<span class=\"mw-default-size\" typeof=\"mw:Error mw:File\/Frameless\">\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>After rappelling off Grotto Falls, return to the trail head via the Grotto Falls trail.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Red_tape\">Red tape<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Beta_sites\">Beta sites<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media<\/h2><\/div>\n<ul><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external free\" href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/media\/set\/?set=a.10153376598380333.1073741838.561135332&amp;type=1&amp;l=d15ee9c483\">https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/media\/set\/?set=a.10153376598380333.1073741838.561135332&amp;type=1&amp;l=d15ee9c483<\/a><\/li><\/ul>\n<p>July 21, 2020: The Road for the shuttle is blocked by fallen trees and requires a 4 mile road hike and very long drive around.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Background\">Background<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>This canyon was first descended by Adam DiPietro and Steve Schachner in Fall 2013\n<\/p>\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nParsed by mw‐api‐ext.codfw.main‐6779cc57fc‐m2hmp\nCached time: 20240914191854\nCache expiry: 2592000\nReduced expiry: false\nComplications: [show‐toc]\nCPU time usage: 0.032 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.042 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 115\/1000000\nPost‐expand include size: 812\/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 90\/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 8\/100\nExpensive parser function count: 0\/500\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0\/20\nUnstrip post‐expand size: 529\/5000000 bytes\nLua time usage: 0.002\/10.000 seconds\nLua memory usage: 606898\/52428800 bytes\nNumber of Wikibase entities loaded: 0\/400\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%   28.884      1 -total\n100.00%   28.884      1 Template:Pic\n 51.29%   14.815      1 Template:Str_number\/trim\n-->\n<\/div>","technicalRating":3,"timeRating":"II","vehicle":"Passenger","longitude":-122.8212,"shuttleSeconds":900,"quality":3}
