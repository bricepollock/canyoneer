First you encounter a 20 foot downclimb to a wide ledge where the first rappel is, 40 feet from the anchor to the bottom, although the drop is only 20 feet. After a few hundred feet is a 30-foot downclimb down a low-angle slide that is pocked with nubs and safe for most beginners. In another few minutes a minor pothole is reached. There is a slightly sketchy step-around on the left that beginners may want a handline or may want to avoid altogether. Dropping into the pothole with a partner assist out or with a pack toss is another option. Shortly after this pothole is a partner-assist down-climb of about 10 feet. Then the canyon opens for about 15 minutes. Just before the next rappel is another partner-assist short drop. The 2nd rappel is 60 feet from the deadman anchor to the bottom, although the drop is only 30 feet. Shortly after this is the 3rd deadman anchor, 60-feet from the anchor to the bottom, but only a 20 foot drop. This drop can be downclimbed by the highly skilled or can be partner-assisted. Soon after this is the 4th and final rappel, 25 feet off a deadman. Immediately followed by a 25 foot easy downclimb.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>From the bottom of Benign to Beaver Wash is choked with thick and unforgiving willows.
