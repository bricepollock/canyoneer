Like a lot of other canyons there, you can park your car at the fire shed and start your walk in from there.\n<\/p><p>Clatterteeth has at least two possible starts and at least two possible ways to finish it, all depends on how long of a day you want. Both ways of starting this canyon go via the same access track, along the Bogey Hole fire trail, til you head down a ridge to a saddle.\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Once at the saddle, you can go either left, or right, right is a shorter trip, but you miss out on a lot of fun canyon sections. Left, you go down into a feeder creek, then into October creek, then down into Du Faur Creek. October Creek has some stunning sections of canyon, but it does add on a bit of time to the whole adventure. This is the way we went, via October Creek.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Eventually, you come to where Joe's Canyon exits into Du Faur Creek, this is one of the possible exits, making for a shorter day. \n<\/p><p>Alternatively, you can continue downstream, experiencing more amazing swims and canyon sections til you reach Bell Creek, then downstream from there to the Wollangambie River, and exit at Horseshoe Bend.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Red_tape\">Red tape<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Beta_sites\">Beta sites<\/h2><\/div>\n<ul><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https:\/\/ozultimate.com\/canyoning\/track_notes\/du_faur_creek.htm\">Clatterteeth Canyon - track notes - OZultimate.com canyoning<\/a><\/li><\/ul>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Background\">Background<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>The first descent of Clatterteeth canyon in 1964 by a Sydney Bushwalker Club group: <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external free\" href=\"https:\/\/history.sbw.org.au\/wiki\/196403?s\">https:\/\/history.sbw.org.au\/wiki\/196403?s<\/a>[]=clatterteeth#the_first_descent_of_clatterteeth_canyon\n<\/p>\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nParsed by mw‐api‐ext.codfw.main‐6779cc57fc‐vmw6g\nCached time: 20240914192029\nCache expiry: 2592000\nReduced expiry: false\nComplications: [show‐toc]\nCPU time usage: 0.005 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.006 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 21\/1000000\nPost‐expand include size: 0\/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 0\/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 2\/100\nExpensive parser function count: 0\/500\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0\/20\nUnstrip post‐expand size: 0\/5000000 bytes\nNumber of Wikibase entities loaded: 0\/400\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%    0.000      1 -total\n-->\n<\/div>","vehicle":"Passenger","shuttleSeconds":null,"latitude":-33.5147,"months":["Oct","Nov","Dec","Jan","Feb","Mar","Apr"],"id":77505,"geojson":null,"longitude":150.3434,"quality":3.5}
