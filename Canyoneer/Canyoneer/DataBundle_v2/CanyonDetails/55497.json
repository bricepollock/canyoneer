After this section you will walk along the flat creek till the\ncanyon enters another very nice slot section.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>At the end of the canyon there is a rock slope with some large\nfossils on it. At this point find a trail on the left side of the canyon\nback up the hill through the forest. You will eventually be on a farm\ntrail to the dirt road where several farmhouses are located. Make your\nway back up the road to your cars.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<p>Highlight Video: {{#ev:youtube|Y-fS4DdNSRU}}</p>\n<p>Trip Video: {{#ev:youtube|qFWqnj0Z_ec}}</p>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n<p>This canyon was discovered by David Ov, Pascal von Duin, and\nCanyoning Bob.</p>\n"
