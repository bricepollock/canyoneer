  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>Garisangol: Go south from the bridge (장수3교 south) Quickest access\nis to climb up the valley - and then descend once you've climbed as far\nas you're prepared to go. There are a few slides within. The most\ntechnical section is at the top - where there is a higher risk of\nfalling rocks. Easy canyoning.</p>\n<p>The stream passing under this bridge (coming from the north) comes\nfrom Oseung Falls - another canyon in the area.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n"
