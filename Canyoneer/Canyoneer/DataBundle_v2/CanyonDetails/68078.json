  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>First some reasons not to go when you are checking the water at the\nend of the canyon :</p>\n<p>- the flow seems low and there is no ice. So the capture is surely\non, which means above the capture there is way more water, and below the\ncapture there could be release of water from Brenay and Otemma\nglaciers.</p>\n<p>- the flow is low and there is ice. Not only the very narrow passages\nwill be blocked (one is not more that 30cm wide), but on the big\nWaterfall there can be deadly ice falls.</p>\n<p>- the water seems brownish and not turquoise. There are probably\nsub-glacier lakes that are about to break out.</p>\n<p>- temperature is above 0° Celsius. You'll be safe until 11 o'clock to\nmidday, afterwards the flow can increase immensely as the glacier is\nquite flat and gets a lot of sun.</p>\n<p>- the flow looks heavy but doable. Well, go for it, if you think you\ncan handle it! But remember, the water comes directly from the glacier,\nyour fingers might not like it.</p>\n<p>It's one of the most extreme canyons that Switzerland has to offer.\nIts remote location, high altitude and technical rappels can turn your\njourney into one of your best days ever, or your worst nightmare.\nPossible timespan to do this descent is very short, reaching from mid to\nend of october, due to the high altitude (start at 2750m !), ice is\nforming very quickly.</p>\n<p>Bring enough anchors in case ice has formed over the existing\nones.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>At this period of the year, the road to the dam is often already\nclosed, so you should take a bike as well. Once you crossed the dam, a\npath, which includes some ladders, leads up towards the Giétro glacier.\nThe canyon start just nearby the end of the glacier.</p>\n<p>If up there you don't feel like going into the narrow part, you can\nstill explore some parts of the old branch, the rock is just as nice as\nin the real canyon, but it's almost dry :</p>\n<p><a\nhref=\"https://ropewiki.com/Gi%C3%A9tro_(old_branch)\">https://ropewiki.com/Gi%C3%A9tro_(old_branch)</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>The start is nice, because it is still relatively open, but already\naquatic. Normally you should realise after those 6-8 pitches if you feel\nready for the narrow part.</p>\n<p>Immediately after entering the narrow part, there is a succession of\n3-4 Waterfalls that is insane. A bit later there is another 12-15m drop,\nwhere the exit of the pool is only 30cm wide. However it is easily\npossible to hold onto it, and below the water, there is a small ledge,\nhelping to stand up and climb over the crack. After a few more smaller\nrappels, there is a possible exit on the right side. About at the same\nheight as a little affluent comes from the left. If you feel a bit tired\nthere, it's probably better to go out.</p>\n<p>If not, a few more Rappels lead to the start of the 100m drop. It is\nsplit up in 20+20+65, however it is more advisable to go for 20+85, as\nthe lower belay station gets a lot of water, and the nut is not\ntightened as it turns completely without control.</p>\n<p>After a few more smaller pitches, you'll be at the water capture, go\nover it and do one more abseil, there it is possible to go out on the\nright hand side. From there on, there are still many open Rappels to do,\nwith a nice final into the lake, but it hasn't been done since 2021, so\nthe bolts are probably not all there.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>From the Lake it is easy as you've got your bike ready at the dam and\nmake a hell of a ride !</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<p>Picture credit : Matthias Holzinger</p>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n",
