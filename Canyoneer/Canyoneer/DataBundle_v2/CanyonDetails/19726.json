With only one pitch at the start, only minutes from the road, you can pull your rope after you exit. If you use a tensionless hitch off one of the trees you'll want a 35m rope, otherwise the pitch is around 25m - though you can downclimb the last couple of metres. The canyon is quite narrow with a 'V' cross section pretty much the whole way. Some high stemming is required and you wouldn't want to fall. There were a few shallow pools, all easily avoidable except at the end which required a little more effort. The exit posed the biggest challenge for us. There had been 10cm of fresh snow overnight making travelling on the slickrock too dangerous. We ended up climbing the slot to the top before contouring around. This involved one tricky offwidth crack climb.\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Entry rappel off stout Juniper requires 75 feet of rope if tying off rope. This is a nice fluted rappel. The slot is 300 feet in length and requires several short, easy downclimbs. Optional high-stemming is available but passage on the bottom is possible.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>After the narrow slot ends there is a crack on the right. Go past this by 100 feet. The next slot is the exit. When dry climbing up the prow is fairly easy with one or two Class 3 climbing moves. If wet, take the crack which has some annoying foliage to get by.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Red_tape\">Red tape<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Beta_sites\">Beta sites<\/h2><\/div>\n<ul><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http:\/\/canyoncollective.com\/betabase\/dry-hollow.978?kmlidxna\">CanyonCollective.com<\/a> &#160;: Dry Hollow<\/li><\/ul>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media<\/h2><\/div>\n<p><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external free\" href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/t4tEkWyFBdY\">https:\/\/youtu.be\/t4tEkWyFBdY<\/a>\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Background\">Background<\/h2><\/div>\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nParsed by mw‐api‐ext.codfw.main‐6779cc57fc‐zzrdh\nCached time: 20240914192017\nCache expiry: 2592000\nReduced expiry: false\nComplications: [show‐toc]\nCPU time usage: 0.006 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.007 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 21\/1000000\nPost‐expand include size: 0\/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 0\/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 2\/100\nExpensive parser function count: 0\/500\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0\/20\nUnstrip post‐expand size: 0\/5000000 bytes\nNumber of Wikibase entities loaded: 0\/400\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%    0.000      1 -total\n-->\n<\/div>","name":"Dry Hollow","permit":"No","rappelCountMax":1,"rappelLongestMeters":19.81}
