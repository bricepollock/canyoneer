Group of 2. Took us 2 hours 5 minutes car to car. It had rained two days prior and everything was wet and crumbly. We did some stemming to keep our feet dry in the narrows. At the first drop we noticed webbing around a boulder on the rim on canyon right and opted for this 75 foot rappel into the canyon. We down climbed on canyon right at the second two small rappels, in order to keep our feet dry. The final, grotto rappel, we wrapped a chocked stone. Beautiful deep grotto and great views of the river. This is a contrived canyon route, as all of the rappels can be bypassed. High-clearance is necessary on the dirt road in a few places, but it was decent and only took 20 minutes form the highway. \n<\/p><p><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external free\" href=\"http:\/\/www.bogley.com\/forum\/showthread.php?77995-Alcove-Amble-04-22-2018\">http:\/\/www.bogley.com\/forum\/showthread.php?77995-Alcove-Amble-04-22-2018<\/a>\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Background\">Background<\/h2><\/div>\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nParsed by mw‐api‐ext.codfw.main‐6779cc57fc‐292xg\nCached time: 20240914191839\nCache expiry: 2592000\nReduced expiry: false\nComplications: [show‐toc]\nCPU time usage: 0.005 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.006 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 21\/1000000\nPost‐expand include size: 0\/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 0\/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 2\/100\nExpensive parser function count: 0\/500\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0\/20\nUnstrip post‐expand size: 0\/5000000 bytes\nNumber of Wikibase entities loaded: 0\/400\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%    0.000      1 -total\n-->\n<\/div>","latitude":37.9403,"quality":3.3,"permit":"No","timeRating":"II","vehicle":null,"url":"https:\/\/ropewiki.com\/Alcove_Amble_Canyon","rappelCountMax":5,"geojson":{"type":"FeatureCollection","features":[{"properties":{"name":"Alcove Amble Canyon Trailhead \/ Parking"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[[-110.362697,37.940408,0]]}},{"properties":{"name":"R1"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"coordinates":[[-110.3628414,37.9420735,0]],"type":"Point"}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"LineString","coordinates":[[-110.362697,37.940408,0],[-110.3626046,37.9408968,0],[-110.3625134,37.9414933,0],[-110.3625455,37.941836,0],[-110.3626636,37.9419968,0],[-110.3628414,37.9420735,0]]},"properties":{"name":"Alcove Amble - Approach"}},{"properties":{"name":"Alcove Amble - Descent"},"geometry":{"type":"LineString","coordinates":[[-110.3628414,37.9420735,0],[-110.3630605,37.9421533,0],[-110.3634307,37.9422168,0],[-110.3637257,37.9422168,0],[-110.3640208,37.9421406,0],[-110.3645572,37.9420264,0],[-110.3651205,37.9418825,0],[-110.3654638,37.9418529,0],[-110.3662863,37.9417923,0],[-110.3667262,37.9417077,0],[-110.3670374,37.9415892,0],[-110.367327,37.9415892,0],[-110.367606,37.9415977,0],[-110.3678635,37.9415554,0],[-110.3681639,37.9414539,0],[-110.368357,37.9413439,0],[-110.3685179,37.9412762,0],[-110.3687432,37.9412508,0],[-110.3689685,37.9412508,0],[-110.3691485,37.941293,0],[-110.3692826,37.9412803,0],[-110.369363,37.9412422,0],[-110.3694381,37.9411766,0],[-110.3695481,37.941128,0],[-110.3696876,37.9410984,0],[-110.3697868,37.9410603,0],[-110.3698941,37.9410264,0],[-110.3699639,37.9409397,0],[-110.3700282,37.9408276,0],[-110.3701463,37.9407303,0],[-110.3703662,37.9404426,0],[-110.3705969,37.9402755,0],[-110.3708785,37.9399751,0],[-110.3709724,37.9398799,0]]},"type":"Feature"},{"properties":{"name":"Alcove Amble - Exit"},"geometry":{"type":"LineString","coordinates":[[-110.3709724,37.9398799,0],[-110.3709818,37.9398605,0],[-110.3709778,37.9398467,0],[-110.370955,37.9398277,0],[-110.3709268,37.9397949,0],[-110.3709147,37.9397642,0],[-110.3709912,37.9396722,0],[-110.37101,37.9396182,0],[-110.3709791,37.9395643,0],[-110.3709147,37.9395188,0],[-110.3708168,37.9394966,0],[-110.3706814,37.9395093,0],[-110.3705647,37.9395982,0],[-110.370436,37.9398266,0],[-110.370326,37.9399133,0],[-110.3701597,37.9400276,0],[-110.3699827,37.940091,0],[-110.3698271,37.9401608,0],[-110.3695321,37.9402328,0],[-110.3687757,37.9403935,0],[-110.3677672,37.9405691,0],[-110.3674212,37.9406727,0],[-110.3670242,37.9407743,0],[-110.3666541,37.9408674,0],[-110.3664636,37.9408843,0],[-110.3663349,37.9408885,0],[-110.3659272,37.9408674,0],[-110.3655892,37.9408166,0],[-110.362697,37.940408,0]]},"type":"Feature"},{"properties":{"name":"R2"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"coordinates":[[-110.3637257,37.9422168,0]],"type":"Point"}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"coordinates":[[-110.3681639,37.9414539,0]],"type":"Point"},"properties":{"name":"R3 (Either One or Two Stage Rap)"}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[[-110.3682661,37.9413846,0]]},"properties":{"name":"R3B (If Splitting Into Two Raps"}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[[-110.3701297,37.9407528,0]]},"properties":{"name":"Slot Section"}},{"geometry":{"coordinates":[[-110.3706526,37.9402292,0]],"type":"Point"},"type":"Feature","properties":{"name":"R4"}},{"properties":{"name":"Scramble Up to Exit"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"coordinates":[[-110.3709316,37.9397361,0]],"type":"Point"}},{"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[[-110.371177,37.9397795,0]]},"type":"Feature","properties":{"name":"Optional Drop"}},{"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[[-110.3717201,37.9396028,0]]},"properties":{"name":"Optional Rappel"},"type":"Feature"}]},"technicalRating":3}
