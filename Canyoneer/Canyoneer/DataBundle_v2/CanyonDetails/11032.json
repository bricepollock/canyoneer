Group of 2. Took us 2 hours 5 minutes car to\ncar. It had rained two days prior and everything was wet and crumbly. We\ndid some stemming to keep our feet dry in the narrows. At the first drop\nwe noticed webbing around a boulder on the rim on canyon right and opted\nfor this 75 foot rappel into the canyon. We down climbed on canyon right\nat the second two small rappels, in order to keep our feet dry. The\nfinal, grotto rappel, we wrapped a chocked stone. Beautiful deep grotto\nand great views of the river. This is a contrived canyon route, as all\nof the rappels can be bypassed. High-clearance is necessary on the dirt\nroad in a few places, but it was decent and only took 20 minutes form\nthe highway.</p>\n<p><a\nhref=\"http://www.bogley.com/forum/showthread.php?77995-Alcove-Amble-04-22-2018\">http://www.bogley.com/forum/showthread.php?77995-Alcove-Amble-04-22-2018</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n",
