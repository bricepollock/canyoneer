The first recorded descent was 3 Jan 1976, the party consisted of C Cosgrove, T Willams, R Bradstock, B Allen, J Lucas - SUBW and Kameruka B.C. The original leader Dave Noble was unable to attend due to an injury.  The party were camped on the steps of the then Bell Cafe because of a transport rendezvous mix up. They were awoken very early by a local wanting to use the public phone to call for assistance for a local heart attack victim. (Kameruka Magazine Vol 15 No 1 - Sept 77). \n<\/p><p>The canyon had earlier been pointed out to Dave Noble, Tom Williams and others by Ted Daniels on the NPA trip of 1-3 Nov 1974, from the ridge between this creek and Rocky Ck. Dave Noble and Keith Maxwell went down the canyon on 28 Feb 76 and went out via the now usual exit gully.\n<\/p><p>Photos of the second descent (Feb 1976) can be seen here: <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external free\" href=\"https:\/\/www.david-noble.net\/canyoning\/wolgan\/wolgancanyons.html\">https:\/\/www.david-noble.net\/canyoning\/wolgan\/wolgancanyons.html<\/a>\n<\/p>\n\n\n<\/div>","latitude":-33.2383,"id":44831,"version":"5b98d7c95dfad7f692d209574d42b9b09939e5580bf581a4b098d6da4c974f29","timeRating":"IV","url":"https:\/\/ropewiki.com\/Heart_Attack_Canyon","quality":4,"technicalRating":4,"riskRating":null,"rappelLongestMeters":37,"rappelCountMin":2}
