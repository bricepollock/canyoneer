The first recorded descent was 3 Jan 1976, the party consisted of\nC Cosgrove, T Willams, R Bradstock, B Allen, J Lucas - SUBW and Kameruka\nB.C. The original leader Dave Noble was unable to attend due to an\ninjury. The party were camped on the steps of the then Bell Cafe because\nof a transport rendezvous mix up. They were awoken very early by a local\nwanting to use the public phone to call for assistance for a local heart\nattack victim. (Kameruka Magazine Vol 15 No 1 - Sept 77).</p>\n<p>The canyon had earlier been pointed out to Dave Noble, Tom Williams\nand others by Ted Daniels on the NPA trip of 1-3 Nov 1974, from the\nridge between this creek and Rocky Ck. Dave Noble and Keith Maxwell went\ndown the canyon on 28 Feb 76 and went out via the now usual exit\ngully.</p>\n<p>Photos of the second descent (Feb 1976) can be seen here: <a\nhref=\"https://www.david-noble.net/canyoning/wolgan/wolgancanyons.html\">https://www.david-noble.net/canyoning/wolgan/wolgancanyons.html</a></p>\n",
