While the first\nwaterfalls (about 200m higher up) are still relatively open, the\nfollowing section is already in a narrow canyon, and at the end you'll\ngo through tunnels.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>The exit ist just before the start of Gornera I. So take the path you\nwould take for the approach of Gornera.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<p><a\nhref=\"https://www.descente-canyon.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=16&amp;t=18443&amp;start=25\">https://www.descente-canyon.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=16&amp;t=18443&amp;start=25</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<p>Picture credit : Timo Stammwitz</p>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n<p>There is a water capture above the canyon, so avoid going in there on\nhot days. Bringing a drill and anchors with you, definitely isn't a bad\nidea.</p>\n",
