This creek was overrun by the Beachie\/Santiam Fire in Sept 2020 and has been closed.  Please check on local closures before planning a trip to this area. When the area eventually reopens, use extreme caution when descending the creek. Between landslides, fallen trees, and loose rocks, this area may be unstable and dangerous for years to come. The canyon may have changed dramatically.

Please try to use anchors in or just adjacent to the watercourse whenever possible.  Climbing up to trees higher up on the sides is attractive, but risks trampling vegetation and eroding away the banks.  Riparian environments in the Pacific NW are extremely fragile.\n<\/p>\n<ul><li>Teaching people to rappel for the first time in an aquatic canyon is not a good plan.  Much better and safer to become fully proficient with rappel devices outside the canyon in a safe dry environment.<\/li><\/ul>\n<ul><li>Two strand rappels (as is done in alpine climbing) can be dangerous in aquatic canyons.  Excess rope can be an entanglement hazard in deep pools.  Strands can become coiled around one another to create an obstacle that a rappeller cannot pass, etc.  Taking a class in aquatic canyon techniques is strongly recommended.<\/li><\/ul>\n<ul><li>Beginners \"leading\" beginners is a common cause of accidents in canyoneering.  Enthusiasm is not a substitute for training by a competent qualified instructor.<\/li><\/ul>\n<ul><li>Please use natural-colored webbing for anchors that will blend in.  Black, the color of shadows, works everywhere.  Henline is visited by many waterfall photographers who will not appreciate bright red slings at the top of the waterfalls.<\/li><\/ul>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>From the trailhead, follow the obvious trail along an old road grade for 0.5mi to a junction.  The trail to the main falls branches off left; marked with a sign.  The Henline Mountain trail goes right and is marked with a mysterious \"X\" sign on a tree.  This junction is easy to miss.\n<\/p><p>Follow the Henline Mountain trail steeply upwards through numerous switchbacks.   After another half mile come to an obvious junction.  There is another easy-to-miss sign on a tree reading \"Trail\" with an arrow pointing right.  Go right.  (If you go down you'll end out at R3.)  Continue steeply upwards until ~2600'.  Watch for a large obvious rock formation (pictured below) on the left side of the trail.  Just after, break off the trail and make your way downward to the creek.  Head downstream 100ft to the top of R1.\n<\/p>\n<style data-mw-deduplicate=\"TemplateStyles:r1062633282\">@media all and (max-width:720px){.mw-parser-output .content .thumb>div:not(.thumbinner){display:flex;justify-content:center;flex-wrap:wrap;align-content:flex-start;flex-direction:column}}body.skin-vector .mw-parser-output div.thumb>div:not(.thumbinner){font-size:94%;text-align:center;overflow:hidden;min-width:100px}body.skin-minerva .mw-parser-output div.thumb>div:not(.thumbinner){margin:0 auto;max-width:100%!important}<\/style> \n<div class=\"thumb tright\">\n<div style=\"display:table;\">\n<span class=\"mw-default-size\" typeof=\"mw:Error mw:File\/Frameless\">\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<ul><li>There is some poison oak along the approach trail.<\/li>\n<li>Beware yellowjackets when entering &amp; leaving the canyon in late summer;  they often nest in ground burrows and rotten logs.<\/li><\/ul>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Henline canyon is wide and has plenty of trees.  It can be run at high flow, but it's more fun to run in moderate or low flow as you can rappel right down the middle of the waterfalls.  If rappelling out of the water, please do your best to avoid scraping off the moss and trampling vegetation.  These falls are frequently visited by photographers who will not appreciate the ugly black streaks (aka \"vertical trails\") created by careless rappellers.  This is particularly important in Upper Henline which is visited frequently by non-canyoner visitors.\n<\/p><p>It is recommended to exit the creek after the main falls (5h-6h) and follow the trail back out.  Below Henline Falls there is a long stretch of creek walking with frequent boulder obstacles. If you have time, however, one can descend all the way to Opal Creek (6h-8h). You may can combine Henline with the descent of the \"fabulous narrows\" section of <a href=\"\/w\/index.php?title=Opal_Creek_Narrows&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Opal Creek Narrows (page does not exist)\">Opal Creek Narrows<\/a> for a full day.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading3\"><h3 id=\"Upper_Henline\">Upper Henline<\/h3><\/div>\n<ul><li>R1: 50ft from tree on right<\/li>\n<li>R2: 20ft downclimb right, or rappel on left<\/li>\n<li>R3: 50ft from bolts on right<\/li>\n<li>R4: 50ft from tree on left<\/li>\n<li>R5: 65ft from bolts in middle boulder<\/li>\n<li>R6: 75ft from tree on right<\/li><\/ul>\n<p>Next a very pleasant creek walk on soft moss and grippy white bedrock.\n<\/p>\n<ul><li>R7: 100ft tree high left<\/li>\n<li>R8 (Henline Falls):  165ft from log on left offers a freehang rappel direct to the pool and may be recommended at higher flows.
