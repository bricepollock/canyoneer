  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>As of 2019, Comet Falls (Upper Van Trump Creek) has been descended,\nbut the lower, more gorge-like section (including Christine Falls) has\nnot been descended.</p>\n<p>This canyon begins with the four-tiered Comet Falls (390'), one of\nMount Rainier National Park's most spectacular. Below it, approximately\n4-6 drops on two major waterfall features complete the upper portion of\nthe canyon. For a half-mile, the creek continues in a broad, open gorge\nand parallels the Comet Falls trail. There are likely no rappels or\nnotable features in this section. Below, the canyon narrows and deepens,\nwith 4-6 additional drops and some challenging swiftwater features\nbefore culminating in the two-tiered Christine Falls (69'), one of the\nmost photographed waterfalls in the park. A final section of deep canyon\nand at least one drop await before the exit.</p>\n<p>This creek is fed by glacial melt from the Van Trump Glaciers, and\nits water is slightly milky in color. Water flow is actually very high\nin the summer, even late summer, when sun and heat melt the glacial ice.\nDuring cooler periods in spring and fall, the flow can be substantially\nless, especially on cloudy days. Observed water flows can be very low in\nwinter, but the creek is buried deeply by snow throughout the winter\nseason and Christine Falls is often coated with thick ice.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>Parking: Park at the trailhead for the Comet Falls Trail; approach is\nvia this trail. Parking is limited, with room for perhaps 20 cars, and\nthe lot is often full due to the popularity of the Comet Falls hike. If\nparking is full, a few additional spots are available at the Christine\nFalls viewpoint, 0.25 miles up the road.</p>\n<p>Upper Section (Comet Falls): Hike 2.8 miles and +1600 feet of\nelevation gain, and access where the trail crosses the creek on its way\nto Van Trump Park.</p>\n<p>Middle Section: Very few features in this middle section appear to be\nworth doing. Using the trail is advisable between the upper and lower\nsections.</p>\n<p>Lower Section (undescended): Hike approximately 0.8 miles up the\ntrail (gaining 700 feet along the way), then cut cross-country to the\nwest and drop into the canyon at about the 4200 ft elevation contour.\n(Since the lower section of the canyon has not yet been descended,\nfurther drop-in points may be possible and have yet to be explored.)</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>Comet Falls (Upper Van Trump Creek) has been descended as of 2017.\nHowever, anchor options are limited, which presents quite a\nchallenge.</p>\n<p>The lower sections of the canyon including Christine Falls and the\nsections directly above and below, have not had a documented descent\n(see \"Red Tape\" below for additional details)</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<p>Multiple challenges present themselves in regards to a descent of Van\nTrump Creek:</p>\n<p>- <strong>Risks</strong>: High water/hydraulic features throughout\nthe majority of the year.</p>\n<p>- <strong>Limited Anchor Options</strong>: Natural anchor options\nappear to be extremely limited in Van Trump Creek. The vast majority of\nthe canyon is also within a wilderness area, which has strict policies\non bolting. Making a descent of this canyon without proper bolts would\nlikely be extremely difficult or impractical.</p>\n<p>- <strong>Public View</strong>: There is a growing sentiment in the\nNW canyoning community to avoid canyoning at popular tourist areas.\nChristine Falls is one of the most photographed waterfalls in the park\nand would definitely fit into this category. The goal is to avoid\ndrawing unwanted attention that could have consequences for the future\nof the sport, and/or cause issues with land managers. Fortunately, many\nnew canyons are being opened in the Pacific Northwest every year, which\nmeans there are many other options to choose from for your canyoning\ntrip.</p>\n<p>It is worth noting that as of September 2017, the park has no policy\nin regard to canyoning and a permit is not required.</p>\n<p>A day use fee ($25) or an annual National Park Pass is required for\neach vehicle to enter the park.</p>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Canyon Prospects in Mt.
