It boasts an impressive narrows, big flow even in dry years, and an incredibly scenic final rappel.  The water is noticeably colder than nearby streams and a thick wetsuit and wind blocking cover is recommended for any who dare enter.\n<\/p><p>The best checkpoint for waterflow is the final rap, Wahclella Falls, which can be accessed through a nice touristy trail. \n<\/p><p>If the flow in Tanner Creek is too high, you may still run the East Fork of Tanner Creek. This is a side canyon which dumps into Tanner right above the final falls. This side canyon dries up in summer but sports a decent flow in spring and has 3-4 raps of up to 150ft. For the last rappel you may opt to drop straight into the gorge and run the final waterfall or, for a much safer route, drop further up the rim to land on a rocky platform perched above the final waterfall. From this platform one can safely gaze at the water maelstrom in the gorge around you but then opt to avoid the water and rappel down the dry face of the cliff.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>After exiting I-84 at the Bonneville Dam exit, had up a road labeled “Star Route” on Google maps for 1000ft.  A  water tower marks the parking area and start of the approach hike.  Follow Road 777 for 3.3 miles gaining 1500ft elevation.  Here, drop directly downhill 1000ft between two gullies.  The myriad game trails are tempting to follow but usually end up travelling laterally.  When nearing the creek head left and cross a gully on the deer path; this leads to a wide bedrock section of the creek just above Caesura Falls bypassing a particularly thorny bushwhack.\n<\/p><p>An alternate approach is to drop into a tributary of Tanner Creek that terminates between the two tiers of Wahclela falls.  This will involve a few more rappels up to 140ft.  Once at the edge of the gorge, one can rappel down to a large platform above Wahclella (watch rockfall).  A cairn anchor will allow descent to either the top of the last rap or into the pool below.  As of September 2015, the direction of the rappel line from the rock cairn ends 3-4 feet past the lip of the waterfall and will require canyoneers to scale and climb up the side of the waterfall and cross the jet to get to the anchor on the other side. This is unnecessarily risky. Make sure to change the direction of the rappel line or rebuild anchor so it ends before the lip of the waterfall.  Another option is to sidehill upstream to Swaawa Falls and enter the gorge.  At times where the side stream flow is reasonable, the main canyon will be undescendable due to high water.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Immediately downstream of the entrance point 15 foot Caesura Falls is downclimbed on the left.  A technical jump is possible to the left of the main pour-over but beware – the bottom is much shallower than one would expect.  Scout first before attempting.\n<\/p>\n<ul><li>R1 (Sundance Falls) 30 ft to deep water anchored by a Cedar on canyon left.  Landing zone for a jump has been scouted but not attempted.  Deep water with no obstructions exists at this time near the fall line of the rappel.<\/li>\n<li>R2 (Swaawa Falls) – 52 ft. Has not been rappelled directly into the splash pool at the time of this report due to a narrow pour-over at the exit of the splash pool that appears to be undercut on canyon left containing a powerful hydraulic. Entrance to the slot area occurs on canyon right at a large log spanning the gorge that is visible from the top of Swaawa (also bypasses another small pour-over). Unless escape ropes are placed beforehand, this rappel will commit canyoneers to descending the narrows to the base of Wahclella Falls.<\/li><\/ul>\n<p>The next major feature is 10 ft and downclimbed in a crack on canyon right.  Jump out into the flow and swim – current here is surprisingly pushy (but not dangerously so) along the wall on canyon right.\n<\/p>\n<ul><li>R3 – 20ft an interesting problem: crack on canyon left leads directly to a hydraulic with a jammed stick, a logjam sits above the drop on canyon right, and the exit of the splash pool is a strainer.  Overcoming this obstacle is done by anchoring to the logjam on canyon right, rappelling while straddling a log that juts out over t<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n<\/div><div class=\"mw-content-ltr mw-parser-output\" lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><p>he pool angling to the right.  At the end of the log, traverse the rock wall on the right to a platform.  Best holds are found by climbing down a few feet then back up while maintaining downstream travel.  Ideally a stronger climber will lead this traverse and set up a guided rappel for the rest of the team.  The logjams above and below provide bomber anchor options.\nAfter negotiating the rappel\/traverse, cross the sieve-forming logs to canyon left and descend the ramp\/crack.  This leads to a pool – swim on canyon left to an apparent log jam and climb through.  Take care if exploring the lip of this drop. The bulk of the current flows through a crack on canyon right at the lip of the falls with potential for entrapment.\n<\/p>\n<ul><li>R4 – 15ft anchored from the logjam on canyon left.  As above, anchor to the logjam and rappel while straddling a log.  Rappel to the end of the log and continue down about 15ft avoiding the whitewater.  This drop is jumpable.<\/li>\n<li>R5 (Upper Wahclella) – 45ft.  A bolted traverse on canyon right leads to a small airy perch above a thundering cascade.  The first bolt is well back from the lip and has webbing dangling into the pool for the (BELAYED!) leader to grab.  Although the current near the closest bolt is weak, being swept over the falls here would be injurious at best.  Set up the traverse, and start sending the team down.  The final bolt station avoids the worst of the flow (bottom hydraulics as well) and terminates in a barely submerged platform of rock on canyon right.<\/li><\/ul>\n<p>Jump from the platform out to canyon left and ride the current down avoiding an eddy flowing back to the falls on canyon right.  After passing the eddy, angle to the right to a rock outcropping that can accommodate at least three people.  \nThe next pour-over leads to a frothy pool which empties into the last rappel.  A bolt on canyon left just at the lip of this small pour-over is used to belay the leader to the bolt station for the last drop and to set up a safety line for the approach to the station.\n<\/p><p><br \/>\n<\/p>\n<ul><li>R6 (Lower Wahclela) – 90ft Anchored by bolts on canyon left just behind the lip.<\/li><\/ul>\n<p>As of Aug 27, 2017, the bolts for the final rappel (Wahclella Falls) have been stripped out due to the Winter season. If you have descended R5 (second to last rappel), it is possible to climb up from a rocky platform DCR about 20 feet to a large platform. Send an experienced climber first and send down a rope for others. At the platform, look for a large cairn anchor close to the edge (do not use the one close to DCL as it will put you directly in the flow). The rappel is about 140 feet and lands just barely outside of the white water below. \n<\/p><p>The rappel line starts with a little current at foot level, but quickly transitions outside of the flow. Do not let your rope get swept down the waterfall - there are cracks underneath the waterfall where the rope will get stuck. On your way down, take a second to look up in awe…\n<\/p>\n<div style=\"color:red\">VERY IMPORTANT: This final rap is set as a WEBBINGLESS DUAL BOLT ANCHOR! Please DO NOT leave any webbing dangling from these bolts, otherwise logs and boulders flushed by winter storms may catch the webbing and rip out the bolts or even the rock.<\/div> \n<p>Set up the rappel passing the rope directly through both bolts, feed it first through the outmost bolt rapide and then through the innermost bolt rapide. Set a block on the rope entering the outmost bolt and rap off the rope coming out the innermost bolt. This will allow you to easily recover the rope leaving no webbing behind. \n<\/p><p>Please note you will NOT be able to pull the rope down if swimming in the pool at the bottom of the rappel, you MUST extend the pull tying two ropes together and pull down from the rocky outcroup at the edge of the pool facing the waterfall (where everyone takes pictures).\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>A one mile lollipop loop trail leads from the viewing area back to the main parking lot for Wahclella falls.  From the parking lot it a short trek back to the parking area.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Red_tape\">Red tape<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Wahchella Falls is a major tourist draw in the Columbia Gorge per its beauty and easy approach hike.  Most weekends, summer or not, you will find the trail crowded with visitors;  be prepared to have an audience on the last two falls.  Be aware that canyoning is less well-known in this area, and sometimes hikers may react inappropriately to canyoning activities, leading to degraded relations with land managers. For this reason, locals suggest trying to descend when the number of hikers will be low -- particularly early in the morning and on weekdays. It is highly recommended to scrupulously follow a Leave-No-Trace ethic. Be aware that leaving bright\/visible anchors can annoy waterfall photographers, irk land managers, and may encourage the inexperienced \/ unprepared to try to follow you.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Beta_sites\">Beta sites<\/h2><\/div>\n<ul><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20210527212206\/www.canyoneeringnorthwest.com\/ColumbiaRiver\/Columbia_River_Gorge_Prospects.php\">CanyoneeringNorthwest.com (archive.org)<\/a><\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n<\/div><div class=\"mw-content-ltr mw-parser-output\" lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><pre>: Columbia River Gorge Prospects\n<\/pre>\n<ul><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http:\/\/ropewiki.com\/User:Super_Amazing_Map?id=Tanner_Creek_-_Oregon\">Super Amazing Map<\/a> &#160;: Tanner Creek<\/li><\/ul>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media<\/h2><\/div>\n<ul><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/media\/set\/?set=a.10153639997501103.1073742081.669366102&amp;type=1&amp;l=78e2e5c5ed\">Facebook Album of bolting trips<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/media\/set\/?set=a.10206531363677274&amp;type=1&amp;l=16fb5b31d4\">Facebook Album of 1st FULL descent<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/media\/set\/?set=a.10154311250056103&amp;type=1&amp;l=21d7db1335\">Facebook Album Extreme Flow June 2016<\/a><\/li><\/ul>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Background\">Background<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>First known descent occured in September, 2015 over three days.
