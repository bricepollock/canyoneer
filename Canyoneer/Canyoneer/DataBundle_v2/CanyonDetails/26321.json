The tree is about 20 feet back from the edge and drops about 60 feet to the base of a large tree where you can then stay on rope and walk a steep slope another 20 feet to the top of a small chute which you can then easily scramable down (in the up canyon direction) to very large dirt shelf below. Rap 1 will use about 100 feet of rope travel with only about 60 feet of vertical drop. Once down on the very large shelf below the chute below rap 1; walk the shelf in the up canyon direction about 80 feet (as far as you can go) then scramble into the water course then down a few feet and scramble your way along the RDC side over to a dirt ledge on the RDC side over to large bush / small tree for rap 2. Note: To find the spot for rap 1 described here; you can follow up the trail along the ridge until you get to a vertical section of rock shortly before you get to the obvious head of the canyon. Just before getting to this spot you would have scrambled up a short rock layer. Next turn around and go back down the ridge and back down the short scramble layer and anchor from the largest tree on the crest of the ridge a short distance after dropping back down the scramble. Note: A visual clue to help know you are at the spot described here for rap 1 is; as you look over the edge you are looking kind of at the top of another tree down on the ledge which you will be rappelling to the base of.

Rap 7 at the bottom of rap 6 is anchored about 15 feet back a little over head high on the RDC side from a small wedged log and a single bolted hanger with RT stamped in it and drops about 70 feet. The start of the rap is in a narrow spot going over a choke stone which can stick the rope during the pull. After rap 7 scramble down a short section of sloped slickrock to a sandy wash to walk for about 80 feet to the next rap. (Data by bluugnome.com)"

As you get out into the trees walk the gently sloped terrain roughly following the drainage. Exiting here will provide an easy walkout exit versus scrambling down through boulders in the wash. As you get closer to the road and the grade gets less steep; make your way back to the drainage and walk the shallow wash back to the road. (Data by bluugnome.com)"
