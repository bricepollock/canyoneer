  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>NOTE: This canyon was named by one of the team members on the First\nDescent trip 3-4-18. Her name is JOY WELLING. She was in another canyon\nthe following weekend, and sadly passed away when her rappel anchor\nfailed. I would like to honor her by dedicating this canyon to her. She\nwas a great team member to help get this canyon completed, and wonderful\nto work with while getting it done.</p>\n<p>Initially, this canyon appeared to have \"Diddly Squat\" in it. I\nwasn't expecting much here. What a surprise to find it has a lot of very\nworthy features. It should be more appropriate to call it \"Diddly Squat\nNot\". So don't let the name discourage you from seeing it. Cool\ncanyon.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<p>FIRST DESCENT TRIP REPORT 3-4-18 :</p>\n<p><a\nhref=\"https://www.facebook.com/scott.swaney/media_set?set=a.10156196491892930.1073742455.668617929&amp;type=3&amp;notif_id=1520537281299619&amp;notif_t=feedback_reaction_generic&amp;ref=notif\">https://www.facebook.com/scott.swaney/media_set?set=a.10156196491892930.1073742455.668617929&amp;type=3&amp;notif_id=1520537281299619&amp;notif_t=feedback_reaction_generic&amp;ref=notif</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n<p>First descent exploration led by Scott Swaney &amp; Team on 3-4-18 ,\nSee trip report above for the team and other details</p>\n",
