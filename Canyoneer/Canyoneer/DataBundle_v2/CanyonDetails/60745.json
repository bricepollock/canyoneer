This creek was overrun by the Beachie\/Santiam Fire in Sept 2020 and has been closed.  Please check on local closures before planning a trip to this area. When the area eventually reopens, use extreme caution when descending the creek. Between landslides, fallen trees, and loose rocks, this area may be unstable and dangerous for years to come. The canyon may have changed dramatically. Do not rely on the beta below being accurate.<\/font><\/b>\n<\/p><p>A nice short creek, good for beginners.  Good for training.  Best visited in May timeframe for decent water.  Don't bother after June.  Possibly a good one to visit when everything else in the area is running high.\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>From Gates, OR, head east on Hwy 22 for ~2mi and turn off onto an unsigned gravel road on the left.  UTM 10N 549380mE 4956001mN.   Follow the road upward for ~2.8mi to where it crosses Packsaddle Creek.  Road is a notch overgrown, but otherwise in good shape as of 2019.  Park just past the creek in a wide grassy area on the left.\n<\/p><p>From the parking area, proceed east down the road maybe 100ft and look for a flat area on the left\/north where it’s easy to get into the forest. Follow a game trail up onto the ridge (steep at first) and then upwards wherever is easiest.  Gain 600ft vertical and on nearing 2800ft elevation the terrain eases off.  Bear left and keep going until you reach Packsaddle Creek.  Nice flat area to suit up with an easy drop down into the creek.  First rappel comes immediately after the drop-in.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<ul><li>R1: 50ft down a large bedrock expanse from tree DCR.  Need about 80ft of rope per anchor location.  A tributary joins at the bottom and the creek’s volume doubles.<\/li>\n<li>Long bedrock “slide-walk”.<\/li>\n<li>Reach 8ft step.  Easy bypass DCL and duck under a big fallen tree.<\/li>\n<li>R2:  40ft.  Anchored on tree DCL.<\/li>\n<li>R3: Two stage.  20ft through mini-slot, horizontal segment, followed by 10ft drop.  Lower stage probably could be downclimbed carefully (?).  Anchored tree DCL.<\/li>\n<li>R4:  25ft.  Anchored off tree fallen across the creek.<\/li>\n<li>6ft step.  Downclimb DCL.  Short downclimb to the next rappel.<\/li>\n<li>R5:  40ft?  Two stage:  Narrow chute to 4ft drop, horizontal segment and then 20ft drop.  Anchored on a tree DCR.  Need additional rope per the horizontal distance.<\/li>\n<li>R6:  65ft.  Anchored on a tree on the edge DCR.  Very blocky rappel.  Gi-normous dead old growth tree lying in the landing zone.<\/li>\n<li>R7:  20ft.  Anchored on small tree on the DCL.  (Possibly downclimb DCR?)<\/li>\n<li>15ft slide.  Downclimb or rappel.  Big mess just after the bottom where a landslide has come in DCR.  Easily bypassed DCR and get back in the creek.<\/li><\/ul>\n<p>Walk down through one last bedrock section (nice little chute).  Road is visible ahead, so thrash out wherever is easiest.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Walk out of the creek to your car.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Red_tape\">Red tape<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>None.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Beta_sites\">Beta sites<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Background\">Background<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>First descent in June 2019 by Kevin Clark.\n<\/p>\n\n\n<\/div>","months":["Apr","May"],"longitude":-122.3629,"rappelCountMin":7,"technicalRating":3,"timeRating":"II","quality":1,"rappelCountMax":7,"waterRating":"C","name":"Packsaddle Creek","shuttleSeconds":null,"permit":"Closed","rappelLongestMeters":19.81,"vehicle":"Passenger","latitude":44.7703,"geojson":{"type":"FeatureCollection","features":[{"properties":{"name":"Parking"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[[-122.36289024353029,44.770212980220705,0]]},"type":"Feature"},{"geometry":{"type":"LineString","coordinates":[[-122.36274003982545,44.77019774662404,0],[-122.36233234405519,44.7698778401658,0],[-122.36228942871095,44.76960363321991,0],[-122.36183881759645,44.769695035679845,0],[-122.36104488372804,44.76993877486589,0],[-122.3606586456299,44.770182513023336,0],[-122.36033678054811,44.77047195074939,0],[-122.36007928848267,44.77088325449653,0],[-122.35986471176149,44.77111175531263,0],[-122.35990762710573,44.77135548852007,0],[-122.35984325408937,44.771416421661215,0],[-122.35977888107301,44.771903884476004,0],[-122.35980033874513,44.77265030393763,0],[-122.36018657684328,44.773442411998985,0],[-122.36018657684328,44.77379276402223,0],[-122.3602080345154,44.77405171849939,0],[-122.36040115356447,44.774371601838645,0],[-122.36063718795778,44.77458485641376,0],[-122.36076593399049,44.77482857496388,0]]},"properties":{"name":"Approach (Bushwhack)","stroke":"#00CD00"},"type":"Feature"},{"properties":{"stroke":"#FF0000","name":"Descent"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"LineString","coordinates":[[-122.36091613769533,44.77482857496388,0],[-122.36106634140016,44.77434113683505,0],[-122.3610019683838,44.77389939247697,0],[-122.3611092567444,44.77371660071971,0],[-122.3616671562195,44.77356427381335,0],[-122.36194610595705,44.773396713752305,0],[-122.36209630966188,44.77306159217168,0],[-122.36233234405519,44.77251320720871,0],[-122.36237525939943,44.77207144886836,0],[-122.36235380172731,44.77137072181137,0],[-122.36274003982545,44.77047195074939,0],[-122.3629117012024,44.7703196152849,0],[-122.36293315887453,44.7703196152849,0]]}}]}}
