  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p><strong><font color=\"red\">Current Status: Closed. This creek was\noverrun by the Beachie/Santiam Fire in Sept 2020 and has been closed.\nPlease check on local closures before planning a trip to this area. When\nthe area eventually reopens, use extreme caution when descending the\ncreek. Between landslides, fallen trees, and loose rocks, this area may\nbe unstable and dangerous for years to come. The canyon may have changed\ndramatically. Do not rely on the beta below being\naccurate.</font></strong></p>\n<p>A nice short creek, good for beginners. Good for training. Best\nvisited in May timeframe for decent water. Don't bother after June.\nPossibly a good one to visit when everything else in the area is running\nhigh.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>From Gates, OR, head east on Hwy 22 for ~2mi and turn off onto an\nunsigned gravel road on the left. UTM 10N 549380mE 4956001mN. Follow the\nroad upward for ~2.8mi to where it crosses Packsaddle Creek. Road is a\nnotch overgrown, but otherwise in good shape as of 2019. Park just past\nthe creek in a wide grassy area on the left.</p>\n<p>From the parking area, proceed east down the road maybe 100ft and\nlook for a flat area on the left/north where it’s easy to get into the\nforest. Follow a game trail up onto the ridge (steep at first) and then\nupwards wherever is easiest. Gain 600ft vertical and on nearing 2800ft\nelevation the terrain eases off. Bear left and keep going until you\nreach Packsaddle Creek. Nice flat area to suit up with an easy drop down\ninto the creek. First rappel comes immediately after the drop-in.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>R1: 50ft down a large bedrock expanse from tree DCR. Need about 80ft\nof rope per anchor location. A tributary joins at the bottom and the\ncreek’s volume doubles.</li>\n<li>Long bedrock “slide-walk”.</li>\n<li>Reach 8ft step. Easy bypass DCL and duck under a big fallen\ntree.</li>\n<li>R2: 40ft. Anchored on tree DCL.</li>\n<li>R3: Two stage. 20ft through mini-slot, horizontal segment, followed\nby 10ft drop. Lower stage probably could be downclimbed carefully (?).\nAnchored tree DCL.</li>\n<li>R4: 25ft. Anchored off tree fallen across the creek.</li>\n<li>6ft step. Downclimb DCL. Short downclimb to the next rappel.</li>\n<li>R5: 40ft? Two stage: Narrow chute to 4ft drop, horizontal segment\nand then 20ft drop. Anchored on a tree DCR. Need additional rope per the\nhorizontal distance.</li>\n<li>R6: 65ft. Anchored on a tree on the edge DCR. Very blocky rappel.\nGi-normous dead old growth tree lying in the landing zone.</li>\n<li>R7: 20ft. Anchored on small tree on the DCL. (Possibly downclimb\nDCR?)</li>\n<li>15ft slide. Downclimb or rappel. Big mess just after the bottom\nwhere a landslide has come in DCR. Easily bypassed DCR and get back in\nthe creek.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Walk down through one last bedrock section (nice little chute). Road\nis visible ahead, so thrash out wherever is easiest.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>Walk out of the creek to your car.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<p>None.</p>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n<p>First descent in June 2019 by Kevin Clark.</p>\n",
