Not a destination\non its own, but worth a stop if you happen to be passing through the\narea. A 0.3mi trail leads down into the canyon past the remains of an\nold hydroelectric plant that operated until 1963. There's another short\nwaterfall 300 yards downstream.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The falls are at their most impressive in the spring in full\nspate.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<p>Sadly, rappelling of the falls is prohibited.</p>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n",
