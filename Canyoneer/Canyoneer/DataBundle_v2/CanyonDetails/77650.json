Bob Sault writes \"Ian, Norm, Damien (Michael Dougherty) and I \"discovered\" Crikey Ck either in late November or early December 1981, and went down it with a larger party in early 1982\". Shortly after, the first SUBW party to abseil into the canyon consisted of Ian Wilson, Mike Doherty, Bob Sault, Tony Norman, Anne Gray, Nick Melhuish, Doug Wheen, Russel Looby and Mike Morgan.(VS&amp;M; No 2 - 1983). They saw no signs of any previous party and had to throw logs down the canyon for some of the belay points.\n<\/p><p>In his guidebook, Rick Jamieson credits the naming and first descent to Peter Treseder (1976, naming the canyon \"Anembo\").\n<\/p><p>David Noble responds: \"<i>Peter Treseder was unaware of the location of this canyon until I supplied it to him at his request in the mid 80's (he was at that time active in search and rescue and wanted to know where it was in case he was called out to a search there). Several years later, in a phone conversation, he told me that he had done a solo trip in the Wollangambe in the mid-seventies and been down a canyon which may have been Crikey, but he wasn't sure and didn't know exactly where he had been. In light of the information given by the first SUBW party - it seems unlikely that Peter's canyon was Crikey. Signs of even a single solo party down a canyon, in my experience, can be very persistent.<\/i>\"\n<\/p><p>The general consensus of the OzCanyon community, is that SUBW most likely made the first descent. In 2001, Peter Treseder was exposed by Inside Sport to have made many exaggerated or false claims:\n<\/p>\n<ul><li>Inside Sport: <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external free\" href=\"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20040616234452\/http:\/\/www.coolrunning.com.au\/ultra\/treseder1.shtml\">https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20040616234452\/http:\/\/www.coolrunning.com.au\/ultra\/treseder1.shtml<\/a><\/li>\n<li>Sydney Morning Herald: <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external free\" href=\"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20020219011640\/https:\/\/www.smh.com.au\/news\/0202\/19\/national\/national22.html\">https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20020219011640\/https:\/\/www.smh.com.au\/news\/0202\/19\/national\/national22.html<\/a><\/li><\/ul>\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nParsed by mw‐api‐ext.codfw.main‐6779cc57fc‐8xjwg\nCached time: 20240914191845\nCache expiry: 2592000\nReduced expiry: false\nComplications: [show‐toc]\nCPU time usage: 0.006 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.007 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 21\/1000000\nPost‐expand include size: 0\/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 0\/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 2\/100\nExpensive parser function count: 0\/500\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0\/20\nUnstrip post‐expand size: 0\/5000000 bytes\nNumber of Wikibase entities loaded: 0\/400\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%    0.000      1 -total\n-->\n<\/div>","url":"https:\/\/ropewiki.com\/Crikey","permit":"No","name":"Crikey","vehicle":null,"waterRating":null,"shuttleSeconds":null,"technicalRating":null,"months":["Oct","Nov","Dec","Jan","Feb","Mar","Apr"],"id":77650,"latitude":-33.3656,"version":"fe3af05ea73ec7dd2aad87ca62136cc7c558a32df0b388f42eb598ef327bcada","rappelCountMax":null,"quality":0,"geojson":null,"rappelCountMin":null,"timeRating":null,"riskRating":null,"rappelLongestMeters":null,"longitude":150.3597}
