  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>Shorter and smaller than its down stream brother <a\nhref=\"Jump_Trip_(Lower)\" title=\"wikilink\">Lower Jump Trip</a>, Upper\nJump Trip is still a trip to be taken seriously. Some technical\nobstacles may be more difficult than those in <a\nhref=\"Jump_Trip_(Lower)\" title=\"wikilink\">Lower Jump Trip</a> depending\non conditions.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>Drop a shuttle vehicle at the exit parking lot. This parking lot can\nbe harder to identify in person than it might seem from Google Earth;\nensure that you have located the correct area by making sure there is a\ngreen gate blocking a dirt road to the south of the paved road. There\nwill be another dirt road on the north side of the paved road. (If Black\nRock campground is full, this other dirt road goes back 1/2 mile to a\nnice private camping area).</p>\n<p>After leaving the takeout vehicle, drive back up the paved road 1\nmile and take the exit for Blackrock campground. About 1/4 mile before\nthe campground there is a spur road steeply descending to the right\n(south), along with a wooden signbox. Park here and hike down the spur\nroad 200 yards to large flat areas on the right and left. Just below the\nflat area on the right is another dirt road leading off to the right.\nHike down this road for 5 minutes to some large flat granite slabs at\nthe river and put wetsuits on here.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>Proceed down stream. One person in the group should verify water\ndepth before each jump as conditions can change drastically. In many\ncases, it may be difficult to construct an anchor for the last person.\nBut, if the last person is able to jump, they can <a href=\"Meat_anchor\"\ntitle=\"wikilink\">meat anchor</a> the rest of the group. The number of\nrappels and longest rappel length are based on an average group jumping\noften. It is possible to do the entire trip without rope if no pools are\nchecked for depth, but this is not advised. If unwilling to make large\njumps, these requirements may vary substantially. Under typical\nconditions, these are some of the obstacles that will be\nencountered:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Jump rock: There is a small 6ft jump into the large pool when\nheading down stream. If you are able to exit the pool on its RDC side,\nyou can climb up onto the very large boulder and make a 25ft jump into\nthe pool (carefully avoiding the submerged rocks near the landing\narea).<img src=\"UJTJump1.png\" title=\"Jump Rock\" width=\"200\"\nalt=\"Jump Rock\" /></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Climb/jump: It is possible to down climb RDC (choosing a path where\nslipping would result in sliding into the water), or there is a clean\njump just RDC from the large boulder. The jump from the large boulder at\ncenter is also clean. Once at the base of the jump it is worth swimming\nbehind the waterfall (if flow is safe) to enter a neat hidden pothole\narch room. After this point, there is a long section of canyon without\nmajor features before the canyon picks back up at the Wall slide.<img\nsrc=\"UJTJump2.png\" title=\"Climb/Jump\" width=\"200\"\nalt=\"Climb/Jump\" /></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Wall slide: The inclined slab may be downclimbed just RDC of the\nlarge boulder. Or, you can climb about 70ft past the broad RDC shelf\n(250ft past the downclimb point) and jump 36ft into the water from a\ndry, hanging pothole. If you downclimb the slab be sure to swim under\nthe large boulder for an interesting waterfall room. A downclimb with a\ntiny hydraulic follows the wall slide, but is bypassed by the alternate\njump.</li>\n<li>Ball jump: From a round boulder RDC, make a small jump into a narrow\nchannel below.<img src=\"UJTBallJump.jpg\" title=\"Ball Jump\" width=\"200\"\nalt=\"Ball Jump\" /></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Awkward rappel: Slide down the face of a large boulder being careful\nnot to fall forward off the landing zone. Rappel 15' from an anchor\nunderneath the boulder you slid down, or climb up the boulder opposite\nthat one and jump 22ft to a small landing zone.<img\nsrc=\"UJTAwkwardRappel.jpg\" title=\"Awkward Rappel\" width=\"200\"\nalt=\"Awkward Rappel\" /></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Chute rappel: A single button head bolt RDC is meant to anchor a\nhandline to the edge of a 12' jump from a hanging pothole, but could\nalso be used to rappel to the water to check depth</li>\n<li>Big jump: Possibly the best jump location in the canyon; jump 27ft\nfrom the large boulder chockstone, or rappel under the boulder from an\nawkward start through a hole behind (up canyon of) the boulder. The\nchockstone anchor can also be used to rappel LDC in low flow for members\nof the party not wishing to jump. The pull from here would be impossible\nthough. Flow conditions may necessitate meat anchoring and rappelling in\nthe jump line to check depth as the hydraulics at the bottom of the\nfalls can be difficult to escape. This is where the cover photo for this\ncanyon was taken.</li>\n<li>Slot traverse: Either chimney a slot with moderate to large fall\npenalty LDC, or rappel on a sling into the beginning of this slot. There\nare also bolts at the very top ridge of the rock to rappel RDC.</li>\n<li>Magical chamber: Climb up RDC to two bolts and rappel 10' into a\npothole. Continue on rope down canyon through the slot to a rappel, 37'\nfrom anchors. Be careful of retrieval issues. Historically, there was a\nmagical chamber at this location, but it has been filled in with debris.\nSee the history of this page for more information.\n<ul>\n<li>The bolt anchoring the 10' rappel into the pothole was originally\nplaced to belay a climber going up to a ledge above, where you can walk\n100' down canyon and jump, so that is a second option.</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>Floating rappel: Jump from a large boulder (NOTE: there is a\nsubmerged boulder out about 5 feet, so jump very close to the large\nboulder wall). The meat anchor for the canyoneer rappelling to check\ndepth may need to be floating during times of high flow.</li>\n<li>A few more 5-10' jumps spaced about 100 yards apart finish off the\ncanyon. (NOTE: Where are these jumps??? Only one more short slide)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"water_flow\">Water flow</h3>\n<p>Safe water flow is 12 cfs or less. Expert groups have descended the\nUpper Jump Trip as high as 13-14 cfs, but experienced considerable\ndifficulty.</p>\n<p>Gauge readings from the sensor in between Upper Jump Trip and <a\nhref=\"Jump_Trip_(Lower)\" title=\"wikilink\">Lower Jump Trip</a> may be\nfound at <a\nhref=\"http://www.dreamflows.com/graphs/day.450.php\">Dreamflows</a>.</p>\n<p>See Red Tape below for more detailed information on the flows.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>Watch RDC for a water gauge (a 25' high aluminum cylinder) and\nstairs, and a small dam. Do not exit on the stairs, but continue down\ncanyon 100 yards to a large pool with slabs RDC. The exit RDC starts as\na footpath next to the rusty smashed car, and shortly becomes a rough\ndirt road as it ascends. The exit hike is 540ft of elevation gain,\ntaking about 20 minutes.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<p>Pacific Gas and Electric operates the Blackrock dam and periodically\nreleases extremely large flows. While the typical safe flow rate is 13\nCFS or less, during spring runoff the canyon has flowed at over 6000\nCFS. Ensure that you are not in the canyon when a release occurs.</p>\n<p>In 2009 PG&amp;E converted to an automatic power management system\nfor the underground Hass powerhouse. What this means is if power demands\nexceed Hass's generating capacity, one or two auxiliary generators will\nautomatically spool up, ramping up to 800cfs each over the course of\nseveral minutes. This release is captured and stored in the Black Rock\nreservoir. This is usually not a hazard for the canyon, unless the\nreservoir is full to the brim of water, in which case the excess water\nwill spill over the top of the dam into the canyon. To be on the safe\nside, always check the level of water at the Black Rock reservoir dam,\nand use extreme caution if the water level is at the brink of the\ndam.</p>\n<p>In addition to this, occasionally there are maintenance releases from\nvalves at the bottom of the dam, but these are usually in the spring\ntime and usually occur during weekdays.</p>\n<p>It may be possible to drive to the PGE Balch Camp HQ and/or call them\nat 559-487-6275 to confirm dam release plans. They also have free wifi\nat the Balch Camp HQ.</p>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<p>{{#ev:youtube|aUDpJOhRfIk}}</p>\n<p>July 16, 2019 {{#ev:youtube|5otNk6876yE}}\n{{#ev:youtube|6CfvY8Qf4eU}}</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a\nhref=\"https://picasaweb.google.com/advntrinxs/UpperJumpTrip2ndTimeAround?authkey=m_1yuHGTUQ4#\">Upper\nJump Trip pictures</a></li>\n<li><a\nhref=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/madzoy/sets/72157606825745121/\">Pictures\nfrom 2008</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>{{#ev:vimeo|31640024}} {{#ev:youtube|3_BLLdil66g}}\n{{#ev:vimeo|100683208}}<br />\n{{#ev:vimeo|73273220}}</p>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n<p><em>Paul M</em>: Greg Smith had listened to my Jump Trip stories for\nawhile and asked if he could bring his high school outdoor adventure\nclub down the canyon. I thought the lower section would be too much. I\nhad not looked carefully at the upper except for swimming upstream a\nways and looking down into it from a few spots. I had the foolish\nimpression that it was mostly flat and so suggested we bring the novice\nkiddies there. A date was set, the troupe showed up and I blindly led\nthem down the canyon. We avoided all the nice jumps with rope work till\nwe got to the little 12 foot jump into a slot with an alcove on the\nright. At that point reality started to set in. We realized this drop\nwas not reversible and we realized that the canyon was much more serious\nthan a bit of swimming and down climbing. We turned around and returned\nback up canyon. I managed to find fairly reasonable climbing routes and\nbelayed the others up the tricky spots. We were disappointed but it was\na pretty big adventure even as far as we got.</p>\n<p>Greg was still interested in seeing the whole canyon and I had to see\nwhat I had been ignoring. I returned a week or two later and hiked down\nfrom the heliport behind the cabin at the road junction. John Scow who\nwas the school teacher in Balch Camp at the time showed me this\napproach. I brought a couple ropes and a bolt kit, not knowing what I\nmight find. Being solo, I must have been a little fired up. I never\nbroke out the ropes or bolt kit at all, so the upper jump has a\ntradition of going ropeless. However conditions change and a couple\nspots that I was able to climb are no longer easily climbable. At the\nsideways traverse (below Big Jump), I climbed up on top of the boulder,\nshinnied along, then slid down on the right side. At that point there is\nthe tall boulder close to the right wall. On that first trip and for a\nnumber of years there was a smaller boulder next to it which provided\neasy access to the top of the tall boulder. From the top of the tall\nboulder it was a fairly easy jump to the ledge on the right wall. The\nledge slopes steadily downward till there is good jumping potential into\na narrow pool. I could not see the landing very well, so continued on\npast a very narrow and delicate balancing spot on the ledge, till it was\nquite low and more obviously safe to jump. That trip took 45 minutes.\nSomething about being solo, fired up and used to that sort of thing.</p>\n<p>I reported back to Greg that the trip seemed doable and he brought\nhis high school students back, though I think the next year. We placed a\ncouple bolts here and there to lower the kids. No significant jumping\nwas allowed. They made an annual event of it though and for many years\nit was the highlight trip of the outdoor club at a private high school\nin San Rafael.</p>\n<p>In the years since, other parties have added a number of bolted\nanchors along the route. Depending on conditions and experience level,\nthe trip can be done without breaking out a rope.</p>\n",
