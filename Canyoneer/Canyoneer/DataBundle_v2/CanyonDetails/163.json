(If Black Rock campground is full, this other dirt road goes back 1\/2 mile to a nice private camping area).\n<\/p><p>After leaving the takeout vehicle, drive back up the paved road 1 mile and take the exit for Blackrock campground.

The number of rappels and longest rappel length are based on an average group jumping often.  It is possible to do the entire trip without rope if no pools are checked for depth, but this is not advised.  If unwilling to make large jumps, these requirements may vary substantially.  Under typical conditions, these are some of the obstacles that will be encountered:\n<\/p>\n<ul><li>Jump rock: There is a small 6ft jump into the large pool when heading down stream.  If you are able to exit the pool on its RDC side, you can climb up onto the very large boulder and make a 25ft jump into the pool (carefully avoiding the submerged rocks near the landing area).<\/li><\/ul>\n<ul><li>Climb\/jump: It is possible to down climb RDC (choosing a path where slipping would result in sliding into the water), or there is a clean jump just RDC from the large boulder. The jump from the large boulder at center is also clean. Once at the base of the jump it is worth swimming behind the waterfall (if flow is safe) to enter a neat hidden pothole arch room. After this point, there is a long section of canyon without major features before the canyon picks back up at the Wall slide.<\/li><\/ul>\n<ul><li>Wall slide: The inclined slab may be downclimbed just RDC of the large boulder.  Or, you can climb about 70ft past the broad RDC shelf (250ft past the downclimb point) and jump 36ft into the water from a dry, hanging pothole. If you downclimb the slab be sure to swim under the large boulder for an interesting waterfall room. A downclimb with a tiny hydraulic follows the wall slide, but is bypassed by the alternate jump.<\/li>\n<li>Ball jump: From a round boulder RDC, make a small jump into a narrow channel below.<\/li><\/ul>\n<ul><li>Awkward rappel: Slide down the face of a large boulder being careful not to fall forward off the landing zone.  Rappel 15' from an anchor underneath the boulder you slid down, or climb up the boulder opposite that one and jump 22ft to a small landing zone.<\/li><\/ul>\n<ul><li>Chute rappel: A single button head bolt RDC is meant to anchor a handline to the edge of a 12' jump from a hanging pothole, but could also be used to rappel to the water to check depth<\/li>\n<li>Big jump: Possibly the best jump location in the canyon; jump 27ft from the large boulder chockstone, or rappel under the boulder from an awkward start through a hole behind (up canyon of) the boulder. The chockstone anchor can also be used to rappel LDC in low flow for members of the party not wishing to jump. The pull from here would be impossible though. Flow conditions may necessitate meat anchoring and rappelling in the jump line to check depth as the hydraulics at the bottom of the falls can be difficult to escape. This is where the cover photo for this canyon was taken.<\/li>\n<li>Slot traverse: Either chimney a slot with moderate to large fall penalty LDC, or rappel on a sling into the beginning of this slot. There are also bolts at the very top ridge of the rock to rappel RDC.<\/li>\n<li>Magical chamber: Climb up RDC to two bolts and rappel 10' into a pothole.  Continue on rope down canyon through the slot to a rappel, 37' from anchors.  Be careful of retrieval issues.  Historically, there was a magical chamber at this location, but it has been filled in with debris.  See the history of this page for more information.\n<ul><li>The bolt anchoring the 10' rappel into the pothole was originally placed to belay a climber going up to a ledge above, where you can walk 100' down canyon and jump, so that is a seco<\/li><\/ul><\/li><\/ul>\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nParsed by mw‐api‐ext.codfw.main‐6779cc57fc‐8hkcj\nCached time: 20240914191848\nCache expiry: 2592000\nReduced expiry: false\nComplications: []\nCPU time usage: 0.007 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.010 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 8\/1000000\nPost‐expand include size: 0\/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 0\/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 2\/100\nExpensive parser function count: 0\/500\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0\/20\nUnstrip post‐expand size: 0\/5000000 bytes\nNumber of Wikibase entities loaded: 0\/400\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%    0.000      1 -total\n-->\n<\/div><div class=\"mw-content-ltr mw-parser-output\" lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><p>nd option.\n<\/p>\n<ul><li>Floating rappel: Jump from a large boulder (NOTE: there is a submerged boulder out about 5 feet, so jump very close to the large boulder wall).

What this means is if power demands exceed Hass's generating capacity, one or two auxiliary generators will automatically spool up, ramping up to 800cfs each over the course of several minutes. This release is captured and stored in the Black Rock reservoir. This is usually not a hazard for the canyon, unless the reservoir is full to the brim of water, in which case the excess water will spill over the top of the dam into the canyon. To be on the safe side, always check the level of water at the Black Rock reservoir dam, and use extreme caution if the water level is at the brink of the dam.\n<\/p><p>In addition to this, occasionally there are maintenance releases from valves at the bottom of the dam, but these are usually in the spring time and usually occur during weekdays.\n<\/p><p>It may be possible to drive to the PGE Balch Camp HQ and\/or call them at 559-487-6275 to confirm dam release plans.

I thought the lower section would be too much. I had not looked carefully at the upper except for swimming upstream a ways and looking down into it from a few spots. I had the foolish impression that it was mostly flat and so suggested we bring the novice kiddies there.  A date was set, the troupe showed up and I blindly led them down the canyon. We avoided all the nice jumps with rope work till we got to the little 12 foot jump into a slot with an alcove on the right.  At that point reality started to set in.  We realized this drop was not reversible and we realized that the canyon was much more serious than a bit of swimming and down climbing. We turned around and returned back up canyon.  I managed to find fairly reasonable climbing routes and belayed the others up the tricky spots.  We were disappointed but it was a pretty big adventure even as far as we got.  \n<\/p><p>Greg was still interested in seeing the whole canyon and I had to see what I had been ignoring. I returned a week or two later and hiked down from the heliport behind the cabin at the road junction.  John Scow who was the school teacher in Balch Camp at the time showed me this approach. I brought a couple ropes and a bolt kit, not knowing what I might find. Being solo, I must have been a little fired up. I never broke out the ropes or bolt kit at all, so the upper jump has a tradition of going ropeless.  However conditions change and a couple spots that I was able to climb are no longer easily climbable.  At the sideways traverse (below Big Jump), I climbed up on top of the boulder, shinnied along, then slid down on the right side. At that point there is the tall boulder close to the right wall. On that first trip and for a number of years there was a smaller boulder next to it which provided easy access to the top of the tall boulder. From the top of the tall boulder it was a fairly easy jump to the ledge on the right wall. The ledge slopes steadily downward till there is\n<\/p>\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nParsed by mw‐api‐ext.codfw.main‐6779cc57fc‐6c265\nCached time: 20240914191849\nCache expiry: 2592000\nReduced expiry: false\nComplications: [show‐toc]\nCPU time usage: 0.011 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.013 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 28\/1000000\nPost‐expand include size: 0\/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 0\/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 2\/100\nExpensive parser function count: 0\/500\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0\/20\nUnstrip post‐expand size: 0\/5000000 bytes\nNumber of Wikibase entities loaded: 0\/400\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%    0.000      1 -total\n-->\n<\/div><div class=\"mw-content-ltr mw-parser-output\" lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><pre>good jumping potential into a narrow pool. I could not see the landing very well, so continued on past a very narrow and delicate balancing spot on the ledge, till it was quite low and more obviously safe to jump. That trip took 45 minutes.
