  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>First discovered in 1906, for more than a hundred years this\nbeautiful cave was open to all for exploration. It has an absolutely\namazing room of helectites. Then the state bought the land in 2009 and\nturned it into a show cave, with a tourist catwalk, lighting, and a new\nentrance tunnel bored into the mountain. For several years after this it\nwas still possible to just jump over the railing and explore on your\nown. But around 2015 an injury in the cave resulted in the party suing\nthe Mexican gov't. Because of this the gov't closed off all access\noutside of the tourist catwalk. Even the local Monterrey caving grotto\nclub cannot get permission to enter the cave. Hopefully in the future\naccess to this amazing and wonderfully fun cave will be restored for\npeople with the appropriate training and experience.</p>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<p>Many maps of the cave can be found at the following site.
