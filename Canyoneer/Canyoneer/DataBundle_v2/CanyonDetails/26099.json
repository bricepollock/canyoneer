It has an absolutely amazing room of helectites. Then the state bought the land in 2009 and turned it into a show cave, with a tourist catwalk, lighting, and a new entrance tunnel bored into the mountain. For several years after this it was still possible to just jump over the railing and explore on your own. But around 2015 an injury in the cave resulted in the party suing the Mexican gov't. Because of this the gov't closed off all access outside of the tourist catwalk. Even the local Monterrey caving grotto club cannot get permission to enter the cave. Hopefully in the future access to this amazing and wonderfully fun cave will be restored for people with the appropriate training and experience.\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Beta_sites\">Beta sites<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Many maps of the cave can be found at the following site.
