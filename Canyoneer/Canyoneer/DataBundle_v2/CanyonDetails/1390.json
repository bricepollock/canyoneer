{"description":"<div class=\"mw-content-ltr mw-parser-output\" lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><p>Nice short canyon with a beautiful final rappel between multi-million dollar homes in Malibu. Currently there is some thick brush in the technical section but it doesn't last very long. Well worth checking out.\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Leave a shuttle car in the parking lot for Solstice Canyon, or as close as is possible since this lot often has a large overflow.  It may be necessary to park up to a half mile away from the main parking lot.  Once the shuttle car is parked, drive to the top of the canyon and park on Sequit Drive as it bends sharply to the left, overlooking a spaceship-esque house across the watercourse.  There is probably only room for one car here.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Enter the heavy brush in the watercourse immediately and find the first rappel a few feet down canyon.  The third and final rappel is the main attraction of this canyon.  It has some delicate formations, so be sure to rappel gently.\n<\/p><p>Rappel 1: 90? ft. After a pretty short section of thick brush you come to the top of the first rappel, a 2 stage drop done as a continuous rappel. Anchored off of a tree. The lower section is particularly choked up.\n<\/p><p>Rappel 2: 80? ft. Another short section of brush and you are at the top of the 2nd. Anchored off a tree. \n<\/p><p>Rappel 3: 150 ft. Solid tree anchor, anchored 20-30ft from the lip. This is a beautiful, trickling waterfall covered in moss and an interesting (very fragile) protruding deposit, which creates a nice little overhanging feature. You'll have to be very careful and try and rappel around it to prevent destroying this and the moss on the falls that make it so beautiful. You'll also have a nice view of the canyon you'll be hiking out from the top of this rappel.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Continue down canyon on a faint use trail until it joins a larger watercourse.  Cross this watercourse and climb up approximately 30 ft to a large hiking trail.  Turn right and follow this trail down canyon to the parking lot.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Red_tape\">Red tape<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>NOTE: After the Woosley Fire 11\/18 the area is completely burned out. The parking area (lower lot) is closed. It is unclear if this is private or public land. Do this canyon at your own risk. We were not hassled at the parking for the drop-in. However this doesn't mean you won't be ticketed or towed if parked there at the wrong time.\n<\/p><p>As of 12\/25\/19, the exit from Dry Canyon trail at the Solstice Canyon parking lot is fenced off, citing hazardous conditions.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Beta_sites\">Beta sites<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Trip_reports_and_media\">Trip
