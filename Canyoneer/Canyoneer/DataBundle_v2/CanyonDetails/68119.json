  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>One of the biggest canyons of the alps, especially once you've done\nabseiling and you walk back to the car, you'll notice how high the walls\nare.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>Start from Tierfehd, take the trail to Pantenbrugg, from where you\ncan see into parts of the canyon. Take the path towards Obersand, and\nbefore crossing the Limmerenbach, you should be able to enter the\ncanyon.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>At first it is rather flat with some smaller Waterfalls from time to\ntime. But then comes a succession of three 20-40m falls. After that,\nthere is some walking in a beautiful alley, between walls that seem\nalmost endless.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>A final 3m jump marks the end of this monster. There you can easily\nget onto a path and walk back to the car.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<p>Picture Credit : Alex Arnold Further description in the following\nbook : <a\nhref=\"https://www.canyoning-equipment.com/produkt/swiss-alps-canyoning-vol-2-0/\">https://www.canyoning-equipment.com/produkt/swiss-alps-canyoning-vol-2-0/</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n<p>The catchment area is very big, many affluent have water captures,\nbut even then the flow in the Linthschlucht stays high !</p>\n"
