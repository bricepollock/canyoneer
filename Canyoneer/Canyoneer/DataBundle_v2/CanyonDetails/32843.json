A short, steep\nhike takes you to an approximately 18-foot-tall waterfall thundering\ninto a deep pool. You can climb up beside the falls, perch anywhere from\n15 to 40 feet above the water and jump from where you feel comfortable.\n<a\nhref=\"http://ropewiki.com/Adrenaline_Falls\">http://ropewiki.com/Adrenaline_Falls</a><br />\n* <b>Baker’s Bridge</b> is located where Old Shalona Road crosses the\nAnimas River. It’s where Paul Newman and Robert Redford jump from a\ncliff into a river in “Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.” (Through\nediting, they land in a different river, not the Animas, in the film.)\nJumping from this bridge isn’t just dangerous — it’s illegal. Instead,\npeople climb down to nearby cliffs of various heights — as high as 17\nfeet — and jump from there. <a\nhref=\"http://ropewiki.com/Bakers_Bridge\">http://ropewiki.com/Bakers_Bridge</a><br />\n* <b>Cascade</b> isn’t just one jump. It’s a run through a slot canyon,\nwith mountain runoff providing a series of natural water slides and\nwaterfalls to jump. Once you enter Cascade, you’re committed to being in\ncold water for about half an hour. <a\nhref=\"http://ropewiki.com/Cascade_Creek_(Durango_Waterpark)\">http://ropewiki.com/Cascade_Creek_(Durango_Waterpark)</a><br />\n</p>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n"
