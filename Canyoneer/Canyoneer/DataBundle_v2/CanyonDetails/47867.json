Little Viento is a good one to hit early season when other creeks are flowing too high. Best for local Portland obsessives who need their rappel fix. Recommend just visiting the last three drops on Little Viento;  there are more drops further up the creek, but there's a long walk between them, so they may not be worth your time. This is a short objective which can be run in a couple of hours; perfect for a cold, rainy January day.\n<\/p><p>Watershed: 0.25mi^2.\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Park in the Viento Creek trailhead on the south side of exit 56. Note the gate on the south side of the parking area just before the bridge over Viento Creek.  Bypass the gate and hike up the track. It switchbacks once and opens into a flat area under the powerline. Little Viento is just ahead and around the corner; worth a quick detour to check the flow. Once satisfied, continue up the old track. At about 700ft elevation, the creek should be visible below you on the right. Break off wherever is easiest and drop right down to the top of R1.\n<\/p>\n<ul><li>Beware poison oak throughout the area. Another good reason to visit early season.<\/li><\/ul>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<ul><li>R1: 20ft.

Extended anchor off a log creek center. Watch for some old pipe remnants and wires around the top of the falls (possibly an old water supply to the campground below; hence the name of the falls). Beware loose rock. Any bottom belaying should be done well out of the line of fire.<\/li>\n<li>R3: 15ft.
