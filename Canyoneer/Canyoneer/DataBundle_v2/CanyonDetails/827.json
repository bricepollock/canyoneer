Since Grand Canyon bypasses are typically difficult to follow,\nsteep, unstable, somewhat dangerous and almost never fun, you may chose\nto descend the canyon directly using ropes to rappel the falls in the\ncanyon, then ascending them on the way back. The advantage to doing a\ntechnical descent is that it is less time and energy consuming to see\nthe falls in the canyon by going right through them than it is to hike\nto a fall, then hike back up to and climb up and down a steep bypass,\nthen hike back up canyon again to see the falls from below. The obvious\ndrawback to this approach is having to carry ropes and technical gear to\nand from the canyon, so - pick your poison.</p>\n<p>If descending the canyon directly, there are five significant\nvertical challenges to overcome. The first is a little more than half\nway down the drainage and is a 10 foot tall drop at a chockstone. The\nsecond is right after the first and is a nice waterfall around 20 feet\ntall. More hiking will bring you to the third short drop which is only\nabout six feet tall, but consists of a steep, smoothly polished chute.\nGetting back up this drop would be trivial with a group party where\nthose on the bottom can boost and those on the top can pull up, those\ntravelling alone need to make sure they can get back up this obstacle\nunassisted. The next obstacle is another fall of around 30 feet, the\nshape of which makes it quite difficult to stay out of the water flow,\nso plan on getting a little wet - especially on the ascent. Another\nchockstone drop appears as you near the river, is about 10 feet tall and\ncan be negotiated by climbing down a fairly vertical crack on the right.\nThe crack is hard to see until you are right on top of it, you can get a\nlook at what you are dealing with by looking as far out as you can get\non canyon left when standing on top of the drop. There are a few good\nhand holds at the top of the crack, but it thins out as you go down -\nthe climb isn't without its difficulty, but it is quite short. There is\none more chockstone drop before reaching the river of about 15 feet,\nthis one has a fairly short and easy bypass around it on canyon left\nthat probably takes less time and energy than building an anchor and\nascending would - this bypass route is cairned and pretty obvious.</p>\n<p>Those attempting a technical descent should also bear in mind that\nvertical heights and required rope lengths for these drops will not be\nthe same, as anchors need to be built back from the edge of the drop a\nbit to make topping out on the ascent easier and safer. A 50 foot rope\nshould be enough to safely deal with all of the challenges on this trip\n- a 20 foot rope should suffice for the first drop.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><img src=\"rwl_en.png\" title=\"rwl_en.png\" alt=\"rwl_en.png\" /><a\nhref=\"http://ropewiki.com/User:Super_Amazing_Map?id=Hance_Creek_-_Grand_Canyon\">Super\nAmazing Map</a> : Hance Creek</li>\n<li><img src=\"book.png\" title=\"book.png\" alt=\"book.png\" /><a\nhref=\"http://ropewiki.com/User:Grand_Canyoneering_Book?id=Hance_Creek\">Grand\nCanyoneering Book by Todd Martin</a> : Hance Creek</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<p><a\nhref=\"https://www.facebook.com/pat.winstanley.7/media_set?set=a.2034428586615828&amp;type=3&amp;uploaded=23\">https://www.facebook.com/pat.winstanley.7/media_set?set=a.2034428586615828&amp;type=3&amp;uploaded=23</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n",
