The canyon itself is a steep v-slot with slanted walls and flakey granite. The many rocks and boulders that have fallen from the canyon walls provide many options for cairn\/deadman anchors that can be used in low flow. The canyon features rapid fire rappels and beautiful views of the valley below, dropping 1400' in a little under half a mile.\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Follow the tracks until you reach the bottom of the first waterfall -- this will be fairly straightforward consisting of easy forest and stream walking. Enjoy the thimble berries and prepare for the slog up. Proceed to bushwhack your way DCR until the drop-in point. The approach is steep and often times requires grabbing onto salal and branches for stability.  Try to stay on the crest of the mountain until you reach the elevation 3500'.  Gear up and prepare to use any number of trees to rappel down into the canyon. Cutting too soon into the canyon will result in some pretty heinous cliff navigation.\n<\/p><p>The mosquitos are quite aggressive, particularly at the parking spot and at the bottom of the last waterfall.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Plan to rappel into the canyon around 3500 ft using any of the convenient amount of trees.

We're not entirely sure if it is in fact malachite (or copper?)but the name stuck. Malachite was discovered by Kevin Steffa and first scouted on July 8, 2018 by Brent Roth, Gilly Ellor, Lauren Satterfield, Kevin Steffa, and Tiffanie Lin.  At that time we learned the problems with using imperial to metric system hardware and decided to abandon our initial plan of descending the last 2 drops. The canyon was opened on August 4, 2018 by Kevin Steffa, Jake Huddleston, Sid Creutz, and Tiffanie Lin\n<\/p>\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nParsed by mw‐api‐ext.codfw.main‐6779cc57fc‐jxl2f\nCached time: 20240914191818\nCache expiry: 2592000\nReduced expiry: false\nComplications: [show‐toc]\nCPU time usage: 0.006 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.007 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 21\/1000000\nPost‐expand include size: 0\/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 0\/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 2\/100\nExpensive parser function count: 0\/500\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0\/20\nUnstrip post‐expand size: 0\/5000000 bytes\nNumber of Wikibase entities loaded: 0\/400\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%    0.000      1 -total\n-->\n<\/div>","quality":3,"permit":"No","technicalRating":3,"waterRating":"B","longitude":-121.3644,"timeRating":null,"rappelCountMin":11,"id":52692,"version":"c898a6b5d072c997f4835a84672937f9068dfd9568612408a6a9af364e28740a","geojson":{"features":[{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"coordinates":[[-121.37573003768921,47.636484850594776,0],[-121.3745927810669,47.63626796714748,0],[-121.37463569641113,47.636137836647,0],[-121.3744854927063,47.636137836647,0],[-121.37416362762451,47.63618121351649,0],[-121.37373447418213,47.63594986979634,0],[-121.37328386306763,47.636007705822415,0],[-121.37321949005127,47.635761902269564,0],[-121.37285470962524,47.63557393406659,0],[-121.37251138687134,47.635602852295655,0],[-121.37186765670776,47.63457624536261,0],[-121.37143850326538,47.63448948892291,0],[-121.37120246887207,47.63466300165829,0],[-121.37077331542969,47.63473529846133,0],[-121.3705587387085,47.634677461026904,0],[-121.36982917785645,47.63502448467318,0],[-121.36980772018433,47.63495218827027,0],[-121.36972188949585,47.63490881038048,0],[-121.36967897415161,47.63473529846133,0],[-121.36897087097168,47.63490881038048,0],[-121.36901378631592,47.63505340320634,0],[-121.36862754821777,47.63499556612402,0],[-121.36834859848022,47.634850973138114,0],[-121.36821985244751,47.63476602457231,0],[-121.3673722743988,47.63475156522823,0],[-121.36628866195673,47.63466480907961,0],[-121.36534184217447,47.634292478972846,0],[-121.36469140648836,47.63407739386733,0],[-121.36425554752344,47.63397798448579,0],[-121.36355280876154,47.63393460578727,0],[-121.36321216821665,47.63386230787644,0],[-121.36390149593353,47.632922425933366,0],[-121.36388401346801,47.63291580665971,0]],"type":"LineString"},"properties":{"name":"Approach"}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"name":"Descent"},"geometry":{"coordinates":[[-121.36412143707275,47.63287723887558,0],[-121.36536598205566,47.633166435370136,0],[-121.36768341064453,47.63360022711122,0],[-121.36965751647949,47.633802662024706,0],[-121.37064456939697,47.634149691480516,0],[-121.37128829956055,47.634409962059976,0],[-121.37128829956055,47.63438104317072,0]],"type":"LineString"}},{"properties":{"name":"Exit"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"LineString","coordinates":[[-121.37154579162598,47.63446779979049,0],[-121.37184619903564,47.63458347505942,0],[-121.37240409851074,47.635624540956975,0],[-121.37300491333008,47.63565345915806,0],[-121.37317657470703,47.635826968028425,0],[-121.37309074401855,47.63605831229271,0],[-121.37360572814941,47.63597155831361,0],[-121.37407779693604,47.636202901937736,0],[-121.37463569641113,47.63617398404074,0],[-121.37476444244385,47.6363185733657,0],[-121.37588024139404,47.63657883314237,0]]}},{"properties":{"name":"confluence"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"coordinates":[[-121.36250000000001,47.6322,0]],"type":"Point"}},{"geometry":{"coordinates":[[-121.3639762109757,47.632851240878765,0]],"type":"Point"},"type":"Feature","properties":{"name":"Entrance Feature"}},{"properties":{"name":"Parking"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[[-121.37560000000002,47.6364,0]]}}],"type":"FeatureCollection"},"url":"https:\/\/ropewiki.com\/Malachite_Canyon","rappelCountMax":13,"rappelLongestMeters":60.96,"name":"Malachite Canyon"}
