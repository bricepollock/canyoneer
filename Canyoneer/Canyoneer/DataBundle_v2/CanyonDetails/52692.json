  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>Malachite is a fun canyon with unique geology. The canyon itself is a\nsteep v-slot with slanted walls and flakey granite. The many rocks and\nboulders that have fallen from the canyon walls provide many options for\ncairn/deadman anchors that can be used in low flow. The canyon features\nrapid fire rappels and beautiful views of the valley below, dropping\n1400' in a little under half a mile.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>Follow the tracks until you reach the bottom of the first waterfall\n-- this will be fairly straightforward consisting of easy forest and\nstream walking. Enjoy the thimble berries and prepare for the slog up.\nProceed to bushwhack your way DCR until the drop-in point. The approach\nis steep and often times requires grabbing onto salal and branches for\nstability. Try to stay on the crest of the mountain until you reach the\nelevation 3500'. Gear up and prepare to use any number of trees to\nrappel down into the canyon. Cutting too soon into the canyon will\nresult in some pretty heinous cliff navigation.</p>\n<p>The mosquitos are quite aggressive, particularly at the parking spot\nand at the bottom of the last waterfall.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>Plan to rappel into the canyon around 3500 ft using any of the\nconvenient amount of trees. On the first descent, 2 rappels (50' and\n170') were used.</p>\n<p>R1: 100' DCL</p>\n<p>R2: 20' around a log jam</p>\n<p>R3: 200' deadman</p>\n<p>R4: 40' deadman</p>\n<p>R5: 100'</p>\n<p>R6: 40' DCR</p>\n<p>R7: 100' DCR webbing around a boulder</p>\n<p>R8: 20' boulder wrap</p>\n<p>R9: 75' DCL - webbing around a boulder This anchor might be difficult\nto find. You can crawl through a little cave to get to it or carefully\ngo around the boulder and back to DCL.</p>\n<p>After R9, there is an escape up a sleep slope DCL.</p>\n<p>R10: 100' DCR</p>\n<p>R11: 50' around a large log spanning the canyon.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>Follow the same approach route to get back to the car. You may find\nit easier to follow the stream bed entirely.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n<p>Malachite Canyon is named after a prominent green band of rock near\nthe end of the canyon. We're not entirely sure if it is in fact\nmalachite (or copper?)but the name stuck. Malachite was discovered by\nKevin Steffa and first scouted on July 8, 2018 by Brent Roth, Gilly\nEllor, Lauren Satterfield, Kevin Steffa, and Tiffanie Lin. At that time\nwe learned the problems with using imperial to metric system hardware\nand decided to abandon our initial plan of descending the last 2 drops.\nThe canyon was opened on August 4, 2018 by Kevin Steffa, Jake\nHuddleston, Sid Creutz, and Tiffanie Lin</p>\n",
