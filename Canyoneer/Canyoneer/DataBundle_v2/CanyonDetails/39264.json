  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>The R rating is for the crack formed along the left side of the\nbottom half of the first rappel. The entire rappel is down a narrow\nangled crack and the flow has carved out a crack deep on canyon left.\nThis crack could pose an entrapment issue. While it is extremely short\non it's own, a nice route to combine with Upper Ice Lake Creek.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n",
