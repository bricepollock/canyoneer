class=\"mw-content-ltr mw-parser-output\" lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><p>Headless duck is best described as an enjoyable hike with spectacular views followed by a short but interesting technical canyon.\nCan be completed in 2-3 hours by advanced canyoneers if doing the short approach, which requires a couple exposed Class IV climbing moves.\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>While the short approach is much shorter and can be done a lot faster, it is not recommended for those who are not comfortable with exposed climbing moves. Follow the KML route up and around the vertical rocks into a large crack hidden from the parking area. Keep making your way up into a small side drainage with some notable erosional features in the sandstone, then up the ridge and into the main canyon's drainage. A Slope Angle map is very helpful to avoid getting cliffed out. The approach is just as memorable as the canyon, if not more. We recommend taking some time to climb around the rocks and enjoy the views. The long approach with shuttle should be less intense, but also very memorable, according to other reports.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>A couple spicey DC’s are available at the top if you want fun. Belly of the Whale cavern halfway down on right. Huge arch on left just before final rap. Short canyon so be sure to explore all the side drainages or it will be a very forgettable day. \n<\/p><p>Once you arrive a the top of the canyon, hike down the right side of the canyon and bypass the first few drops.  Downclimb into the canyon just before it gets tight.  This might take a few minutes to figure out, but it is faster than rigging a couple of needless rappels in the watercourse.\n<\/p><p>Once you arrive at the skinny section, you will downclimb two drops that are about 25 feet in height.  Beginners might want a belay on the second downclimb.  After the two downclimbs, take a moment to enjoy a large natural bridge on the left downcanyon side.  \n<\/p><p>All too soon you will arrive at the final rappel, which is 150 feet down a vertical wall.  Take care not to groove the rock or core-shot your ropes.  Some form of rope\/webbing protection is recommended here.  A shirt or jacket works well.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>After the last rappel, scramble down the boulders for about 5 minutes back to the Burr Trail Road.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Red_tape\">Red tape<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Beta_sites\">Beta sites<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media<\/h2><\/div>\n<p><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external free\" href=\"https:\/\/www.smilingcricket.com\/2019\/10\/headless-duck-exploration.html\">https:\/\/www.smilingcricket.com\/2019\/10\/headless-duck-exploration.html<\/a>\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Background\">Background<\/h2><\/div>\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nParsed by mw‐api‐ext.codfw.main‐6779cc57fc‐ncpgm\nCached time: 20240914192114\nCache expiry: 2592000\nReduced expiry: false\nComplications: [show‐toc]\nCPU time usage: 0.006 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.007 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 21\/1000000\nPost‐expand include size: 0\/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 0\/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 2\/100\nExpensive parser function count: 0\/500\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0\/20\nUnstrip post‐expand size: 0\/5000000 bytes\nNumber of Wikibase entities loaded: 0\/400\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%    0.000      1 -total\n-->\n<\/div>","vehicle":"Passenger","shuttleSeconds":null,"name":"Headless Duck","longitude":-111.2677}
