  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>Cascade Canyon shares its upper trail head with Stoddard Canyon. It's\nan excellent canyon for advanced beginners looking for a short canyon\nwith long, low-angle drops. Were it not for the hard landing most of\nthese rappels would be fun sierra slides.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<h3 id=\"trail_head\">Trail head</h3>\n<p>CA-210 to Mountain, turn north toward Mount Baldy</p>\n<p>You'll pass through two tunnels. Pass \"Hog back\" on the right hand\nside, come down a hill and turn right at the bottom onto Barrett\nStoddard Truck Trail.</p>\n<p>Park one car here. Don't leave anything valuable in the car, consider\nleaving your car unlocked or the windows down.</p>\n<h3 id=\"shuttle\">Shuttle</h3>\n<p>The shuttle is optional and is possible but not recommended without\nhigh clearance. A carefully driven Subaru would be fine. Skipping it\nadds 0.8 miles and 190ft of elevation gain.</p>\n<p>There's a nicely graded, single lane, dirt road with two stream\ncrossings, neither are typically deeper than 6-8 inches. You should know\nthe location of your vehicle's air intake since intaking water will\ndestroy your motor.</p>\n<p>Take your other car up Barrett Stoddard Truck Trail. Bare left at the\nfirst fork and right at the second to avoid a private driveways. Once in\nthe shade of canyon and trees, you'll cross two streams, pass Davian\nGrey's Fairytale cottage on the right and quickly arrive at a locked\ngate. Park to the right of it, leaving as much room as you possibly can\nto access the driveway above or the gate.</p>\n<p>Continue on foot, past the gate, to the drop in: 34.2151,\n-117.6648</p>\n<p>From the drop in, you'll hike through copious white-thorn bushes for\nthe first 200 feet, head southwest down the shoulder of a ridge until\nyou reach the canyon proper. This faint trail down the ridge will plant\nyou directly at the first drop. Careful about getting \"cliffed out\" in\nthis area.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p><strong>R1</strong></p>\n<p>60' - Canyon right, big honkin oak tree.</p>\n<p>34.2140, -117.6669</p>\n<p>It appears that local hikers have a way to avoid this drop. I\ncouldn't see how.</p>\n<p><strong>R2</strong></p>\n<p>~100' (70',30' multistage rap) - Big pine tree, canyon left, through\na puddle to avoid poison oak and slightly around corner.</p>\n<p>Roughly 34.2141, -117.6673</p>\n<p>There's a bit of poison oak immediately below this drop. It could\nprobably be removed since there's not a lot and it's a nice rap\npoint.</p>\n<p><strong>R3</strong></p>\n<p>~120' (30' slope, 70' slide, 20' drop)</p>\n<p>34.2147, -117.6681</p>\n<p>There is one bolt at the rappel. I would suggest using the dead fell\ntree as a backup.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>You'll finish off the canyon near a small abandoned dam. There's some\noptional SRT if you climb up to the door at the top of the concrete\nstructure. I'd rig low to the three railings and pad the drop nicely. If\nthe water is low, you could attempt the duck under in the river. I\nhaven't attempted any of this yet however, no clue what's in there.</p>\n<p>To exit the canyon, head toward the road / hillside you saw on the\nway down the canyon. You should find an old paved road. Turn right and\nfollow it up the hill to your car. When you're nearing the car, there's\na waterfall in the river down below, observe the chalk marks and natural\ncolored anchors on wall across from the falls. Summer sport climbing\nfun.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<p>This is the only beta known to the editors for Cascade Canyon</p>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://sangabrielmnts.myfreeforum.org/about5565.html\">Taco\non Eispiraten</a></li>\n<li><a\nhref=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/tacodelrio/sets/72157639029088364/\">Taco's\npictures</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n",
