An awesome 3 room echo chamber, one of the best narrows sections in Zion, jumps, a keeper pothole, log soup, log-jambs, fun down-climbs, quick sand and an easy downhill exit to boot. \nOne canyoneer once saw predatory red worms in these waters the likes he has never seen anywhere else on this planet.

The recommended approach is described first. The sneak approach drops you in right above the echo chamber and makes for a 3CI route. The Top-Down approach won't save time, but it will save on hiking an uphill approach. \n<\/p><p>Note that below Middle Echo is Lower Echo Canyon, which you will see on your left on the way up the approach. This route must be done caving style by leaving all ropes and ascending out, after coming down the 300 foot free-hang into Weeping Rock itself, presumably because the Park Service wants to preserve this park landmark as much as possible and prevent too many canyoneers' footprints from altering or destroying the moss and probably to prevent rock fall onto the many tourists who hike up to the bench underneath this massive ramada. \n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading3\"><h3 id=\"Recommended_Approach--Closed_due_to_the_2019_rock_slide\">Recommended Approach--Closed due to the 2019 rock slide<\/h3><\/div>\n<p>From the Zion Visitor Center take the Shuttle to Weeping Rock. Hike up the Weeping Rock Trail, stay right at the bottom and go up the switchbacks, not left which takes you to the bench underneath the large ramada that is called Weeping Rock. Stay left where the Hidden Canyon trail goes off to the right. After crossing the drainage, stay right and do not go up to Observation Point Trail that heads up left.  After hiking up 2.85 miles from Weeping Rock to a trail junction there is a sign. Go right and down here towards \"Deer Trail\" and \"East Entrance.\" If you follow Bluegnome's beta it will be confusing because the sign does not say \"East Rim Trail.\" It is on hard sandstone and hardly visible. Follow cairns. The drop-in is 1\/2 mile from this trail junction and is at an elevation of 5,594 feet, 3.4 miles from Weeping Rock, 1 1\/2 hours. \n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading3\"><h3 id=\"Sneak_Approach--Closed_due_to_the_2019_rock_slide\">Sneak Approach--Closed due to the 2019 rock slide<\/h3><\/div>\n<p>From the Zion Visitor Center take the Shuttle to Weeping Rock.

About 1\/2 mile further up the trail head right down a gulley and find a blue anchor around a stout Pine.

Spot a car at the Zion Visitor Center for the exit. Drive back up to the East Entrance to the park and exit the park. Less than two miles make a left heading to North Fork and make your way to Stave Spring TH on dirt roads. You will be at the headwaters at an elevation of about 6,400 feet. Alternatively, take the approach to Jolley Gulch and continue along dirt roads, using GPS or a topo map, to get to the trailhead for Echo Canyon Pack Trail.

You will be at the headwaters at an elevation of about 6,400 feet.

The day after a major flash, there was a massive, thick log-jam soup at the top. After entering about 1\/4 of the way, it was thick enough to get on top and crawl across. You may need to set up a hand line to assist. There was another log-jamb soup, not as long. And a massive log-jamb that could collapse at any time with weight on it. \n<\/p>\n<ul><li><b>R1<\/b>: 10 ft. - Anchored from a downed tree or a pinch anchor.<\/li><\/ul>\n<p>If you dropped in by the Sneak Route, you missed a lot of excitement and did not advance your skills at log-soup swimming or down-climbing, but you are clean and probably happy for that.
