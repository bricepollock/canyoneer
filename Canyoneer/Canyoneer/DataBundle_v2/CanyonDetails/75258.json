It is a fun, fast and very cold descent. It contains some small \"slides\" down climbs and one swimmer which is good for jumping. Probably not for those wanting a technical canyon or a warm one. Great for testing wetsuits and having a good time with friends as insane as you.\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Park at the Kootenai Creek Hiking trail parking lot.
