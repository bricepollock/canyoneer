{"description":"<div class=\"mw-content-ltr mw-parser-output\" lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><p>North Kootenai Creek is a large drainage basin within the heart of the Bitterroot range. It is a fun, fast and very cold descent. It contains some small \"slides\" down climbs and one swimmer which is good for jumping. Probably not for those wanting a technical canyon or a warm one. Great for testing wetsuits and having a good time with friends as insane as you.\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Park at the Kootenai Creek Hiking trail parking lot. Follow the trail up as far as you would like and drop into the creek via one of the pre-established trails.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>The creek is multiple stretches of small walking sections, broken up by small slides, semi swimming pools and down climbs. The last 200 feet of the creek is the most fun. .6 miles and under is where all the \"action\" is.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Once finished with your descent find a walking path out or choose one of the many boulders on LDC and scrabble the 20 feet back up to the trail.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Red_tape\">Red tape<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>The trail and Kootenai creek are on private land, be mindful and only walk on designated areas. The creek is accessible because of Montana's stream access law. Do not attempt to climb or sit on any of the rocks to the right of the hikers trail. It is private and the climbing crag is closed.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Beta_sites\">Beta sites<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Background\">Background<\/h2><\/div>\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nParsed by mw‐api‐ext.codfw.main‐6779cc57fc‐brbhg\nCached time: 20240914191844\nCache expiry: 2592000\nReduced expiry: false\nComplications: [show‐toc]\nCPU time usage: 0.004 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.006 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 21\/1000000\nPost‐expand include size: 0\/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 0\/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 2\/100\nExpensive parser function count: 0\/500\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0\/20\nUnstrip post‐expand size: 0\/5000000 bytes\nNumber of Wikibase entities loaded: 0\/400\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%    0.000      1 -total\n-->\n<\/div>","geojson":null,"permit":"Restricted","waterRating":"C","riskRating":null,"name":"North Kootenai Creek","latitude":46.5371,"url":"https:\/\/ropewiki.com\/North_Kootenai_Creek","vehicle":"Passenger","version":"e649496046a19416283761a0815a6a5456fbc276c4efdf25d8184ab7545f09eb","timeRating":"I","rappelLongestMeters":null,"id":75258,"shuttleSeconds":null,"quality":3,"months":["Dec","Jan","Feb"],"technicalRating":2,"longitude":-114.1589,"rappelCountMax":0,"rappelCountMin":0}
