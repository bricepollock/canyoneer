But even before the spectacular views show up, there's a 20 ft\nnearly vertical slide into a narrow passage that defies the voice in\nyour head telling you that it looks...looks like it ought to be a rappel\ninstead. Assuming you've check the water levels are safe, slide! and let\nthe fun begin.</p>\n<p>Even during late Summer, the water is still cold as the source is\nglacier melt so bring a thick wetsuit (or appropriate layers of\nneoprene).</p>\n<p><strong>**Adapted from BC Canyoneers (No longer a functioning website\n8/17/19)**</strong></p>\n<p>A long sculpted, flowing canyon west of Squamish, BC. The canyon is\nsomewhat diffcult to get to, requiring a crossing of the Squamish River\nfor access. There are numerous rappels in the 35-45 meter range, some\ninvolving two stages. One of the notable features of this canyon is that\na number of the rappels end in pools that are enclosed, and escape\nthrough narrow gaps into big open rappels A lot of the waterfalls are\nquite airy, and escapes from the canyon are plenty. The canyon is a\nfairly serious undertaking, requiring a fairly long day, often battling\nsome pretty big flow!</p>\n<p><strong>Warning:</strong> This canyon can be jumped in a number of\nspots. It is up to you to determine whether the jumps are safe or not.\nThe ability to jump into a pool without sinking too deeply is a\ntechnique that can be practiced and improved. Depth of pools can change\nat any time. The first person in a party can rappel into a pool and use\ngoggles or a mask to determine the depth of the water</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>Getting to Monmouth canyon requires crossing the Squamish river. For\nsmall groups, consider renting a canoe at the Squamish Adventure Center.\nIt will fit 3 people including gear. Canoes must be returned at the end\nof the day so be sure to know when the Adventure Center closes.\nDepending on the season and time of day, the mosquitos are particularly\nvicious near the river banks. Some may dawn on a wetsuit to prevent\nmosquito bites but it is advisable to change into your wetsuit at the\ndrop-in point. The hike in is steep but on a well-maintained trail.</p>\n<p>When you get in the proximity of the canyon, after crossing the\npowerlines, make sure you take the trail that goes Left. The Right\nbranch takes to a promotory with a nice view but then dies out.</p>\n<p><strong>**Adapted from BC Canyoneers (No longer a functioning website\n8/17/19)**</strong></p>\n<p>From Highway 99, approaching Squamish from the south or north, turn\nwest at the lights at Cleveland Avenue. After 400m, turn right on Bailey\nStreet. The road quickly becomes gravel and comes to a fork. Keep to the\nright – this is Government Road. Continue north on Government road for\n1.6km, crossing two sets of railroad tracks and getting back onto\npavement. Turn left towards Squamish River Dyke Road (signed for Estuary\nAccess and Squamish Spit) and return to a gravel road. After 350m, turn\nleft onto the dyke road. Right here, beside the yellow gate blocking\naccess to the north (right) you will ῃnd a short trail leaving the road,\ndown to the river. This is the best put-in spot when the Squamish River\nis flowing particularly hard. Unload canoe/kayaks/gear here. You can\npark in the wide area on the other side of the road. In lower flow, the\nriver can be crossed further down.</p>\n<p><strong>Shuttle Vehicle</strong> An optional shuttle vehicle can be\nplaced 1.4 km further down the road. This makes the river crossing to\nand from the trail much easier. There is a wide area along the roadway,\non your left as you drive. It ends, and the road narrows, just where the\ntrail comes out of the woods. Ideally, place things like dry clothing\ninto the vehicle that carries the canoe, and leave it at the take-out\nspot. If no shuttle vehicle is available, plan on about 15 minutes of\nwalking to return to the vehicle at the put-in spot.</p>\n<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Crossing a fast-moving river like the Squamish\nis potentially very dangerous! Depending upon the discharge rate of the\nriver and the dynamic hazards therein, there may be standing waves,\nsnags, partially submerged logs, etc. You can check on the current,\nrecent and historical data here: <a\nhref=\"http://www.wateroffice.ec.gc.ca/graph/graph_e.html?stn=08GA022\">http://www.wateroffice.ec.gc.ca/graph/graph_e.html?stn=08GA022</a></p>\n<p>Put in to the river here, and strike out across the river. Work your\nway across the river, as you head downstream. You will find that the\ntrees you see directly across from you are actually on a long narrow\nisland. You want to round the lower end of the island, and head upstream\ninto a much narrower, slower moving channel on the other side. During\nhigh tides, you can head along the shoreline of the island, and through\na gap between the island and a large gravel bar. (In very high tides,\nyou may not even see the gravel bar – just a large tree stranded on it\nfurther downstream.) If the tide is lower you may need to continue\naround the gravel bar, past the large tree lying on it, and then back up\nthe other side. As you head up this channel on the other side of the\nisland, you will soon come to a small cluster of old pilings on your\nleft, close to the tree-covered shoreline. There are a couple of tiny\ncoves here (N49.71469 W123.17253) where you can pull in and tie your\nboat to the trees. Note: the river here is still tidal and can go up and\ndown a few feet while you are in the canyon – make sure you tie up the\nboat so it doesn’t float away while you’re gone, or else carry it up out\nof the river and into a clearing in the trees! Once you’re ashore,\nyou’ll find yourself in a small clearing with a few narrow trails\nspreading out into the trees. Go to the north (upstream) end of the\nclearing and follow the trail there away from the river. After a couple\nof minutes, it will angle to the left, and in a few more minutes you\nwill hear the chatter of Monmouth Creek.</p>\n<p>Continue following the trail steeply up the hill. (For Box Creek, the\nroute exits the trail shortly before the steep section begins.) You will\nreach a couple of viewpoints that give an exciting preview of the\nwaterfalls to come. Stay on the main trail – it will take you away from\nthe creek for a while, then return to it as the grade eases. Note: There\nare ground wasps in the area. One nest is located in the middle of the\ntrail, about 45 minutes up from the riverside. People who are sensitive\nto wasp stings must be vigilant on the hike in.)</p>\n<p>Approach hike to Monmouth Creek At about 425m elevation, you will\ncome to a spot where the trail reaches the creek again, and turns\nupstream, This is the normal entry point (N49.71533 W123.18801). You can\nenter here, or continue up the trail for five or ten minutes to the\nupper entry point (N49.71511 W123.19111). The upper spot gives you a\nlittle bit of pretty canyon, downclimbing, and a short jump.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>The descent is descrrd log, but is not very deep. During a recent\nparticularly low flow period, the water was only about 1.5 meters deep!\nEnsure a flatter or scooped landing (or cannonball) to avoid going too\ndeeply into the water. Keep knees bentibed in great detail in the Beta\nSites listed below. </p>\n<p><strong>**Adapted from BC Canyoneers (No longer a functioning website\n8/17/19)**</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Rappel 1</strong> A pair of bolts on the right side take you\ndown a waterfall about <strong><em>9m (30 feet)</em></strong> to a pool\nbelow. May be diffcult in high flow. If necessary due to flow, instead\ngo canyon left, and down a short downclimb to sling a bollard above the\npool.</p>\n<p><strong>Rappel 2</strong> At the far end of the pool,\n<strong><em>rappel 23m (75 feet)</em></strong> two bolts on the left\nwall. Takes you down a beautiful, wide waterfall. At the bottom of the\nrappel, there is an awesome little alcove behind a rock, with water\ncurtains on each side.</p>\n<p>Rappel 3 This is the “infinity pool” rappel. Anchored off of two\nbolts on the right wall. In and out of the cascade, but ends in the full\nflow. <strong><em>42m (135 feet)</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Rappel 4</strong> Scramble down and right below a couple of\nbig boulders, and find a pair of bolts on the lower face of a boulder\nlooking down the channel. Follow the wide channel, and over the lip.\nMuch of the flow can be avoided by keeping to rappeler’s right near the\nbottom. <strong><em>30m (100 feet)</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Rappel 5</strong> This is a short rappel down a slab to an\nalcove below a boulder. Anchored off a single bolt on your left as you\napproach. Allows you to avoid a diversion into the trees and scramble\ndown mossy logs. <strong><em>14m (45 feet) <strong>''</strong>Rappel\n6<strong>Emerge from the alcove under the big boulder, and find a pair\nof bolts on your left side. Down the waterfall to a pool below. In very\nhigh flow, could be rapped off a slung boulder in the right side\nwatercourse – less flow here.</strong></em>24m (80 feet)</strong>''</p>\n<p><strong>Rappel 7</strong> At the end of the pool,find a pair of bolts\non the far side of a large boulder in the watercourse,. Drop down into a\npool, over a lip to a ledge, the off to rappeler’s right (canyon left)\ninto an alcove. <strong><em>14m (45 feet)</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Rappel 8</strong> Off a single bolt under a huge boulder,\nthrough a dark tunnel into a deep pool. This rappel is very cool, but\ncan be avoided by an even more amazing jump (about 9 m or 30 feet to the\npool) on the right. <strong><em>12m (40 feet).</em></strong> Monmouth\nJump</p>\n<p><strong>Rappel 9</strong> Immediately after rappel 8 (or the jump),\nround the corner and exit the pool (carefully) at the top of the\nMonmouth Tube rappel. There are a couple of options here. Rap only\noption: As you exit the pool, there is a single bolt on the left side\nwall. Rap off of this anchor into the pool below. <strong><em>21m (70\nfeet)<strong>'' Rap and slide option: Exit the pool, and using the bolt\non the left as a safety anchor, find the bolt on the right side of the\nexit, on top of the ridge of rock on that side. Rig a rope to this\nanchor, paying out approximately</strong></em>9m (30 feet)</strong>''.\nThis length is approximate – rig a contingency anchor for the first\nrappeler, and prepare to let out more rope if required. Rappel down the\nwall to an alcove and drop/slide packs into the pool below. While still\non rappel, sit down on the edge of the alcove, facing out, and slide\ndown off the end of the rope, about 8m or so to the pool below.</p>\n<p><strong>Rappel 10</strong> Immediately after the tube rappel, there\nis a jump of about 3m into a narrow, deep pool. This is quickly followed\nby your choice of either a long shallow slide down a slab into a pool,\nor a drop into a small but very deep washing-machine-type pool on the\nright. Continue down to where a fin divides the water course into two,\nand find a pair of bolts on the left side of the left channel. Again,\nyou have a choice here: Set the rope length for <strong><em>15m (50\nfeet)</em></strong> and rap down to a series of pink ledges, where you\ncan jump into the deep pool below, or else set out 19m (65 feet) and rap\nall the way into the pool. From there, partner assist through a narrow\ngap into the</p>\n<p>If there is too much flow to safely descend this waterfall, then\ninstead move canyon left, and find a pool with a pinch where you can\nanchor to descend a groove along the left wall. With high flow, you will\nwant to make this two stages, all the way into the diving board room.\nApproximately <strong><em>27m (90 feet)</em></strong>. Whichever way you\ndescend, make sure to explore both rooms above the diving board section.\nThe pool can be jumped from the diving boa! Those not comfortable with\nshallow water jumping should either climb down off the log onto the rock\nbelow before jumping, or rappel off of a meat anchor behind the log.\nPlease do not leave a webbing anchor behind on the log.</p>\n<p><strong>Rappel 11</strong> Follow down a nicely carved section of\nrock to a rappel on the right side. The route follows a channel on the\nright past a small pool, and pours down into a narrow section at a 90\ndegree angle to the main canyon. There is a single bolt above the pool\non the right side to simplify descending to this next rappel stance in\nhigher water. Drop into the channel that crosses the canyon, and pours\no to the left. Find a pair of bolts on the right wall, and rap down to\nthe pool below. <strong><em>14m (45 feet)</em></strong></p>\n<p>EDIT (Aug 2021, Max): we set out 20m and it was just long enough to\nget to the pink ledge, so the original length of 15m for jump is wrong,\nmore like 20m to jump and 24m all the way into the water.</p>\n<p><strong>Rappel 12</strong> Follow the pool to a large boulder in the\nwatercourse, and keep left. Rappel off of bolts through a waterfall into\na pothole, cross it, and continue down into another pool.\n<strong><em>14m (45 feet)</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Rappel 13</strong> After rappel 12, a downclimb through a\ngroove leads to a very nice alcove. Follow around behind a huge boulder,\nin a very showery room. Swim below a wedged boulder to a landing with a\nlarge pouroff ledge. You will find a pair of bolts on the right where\nthe water wells up and over a lip. Big water, and lands in a large pool,\noccasionally with fish in it! <strong><em>39m (130\nfeet)</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Rappel 14</strong> Move to the channel on the left, and find\na single bolt on the left wall. Descend a groove to a stance below a big\nboulder. <strong><em>14m (45 feet)</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Rappel 15</strong> From here, move to canyon right, and find\na large boulder with webbing slung around it. Rappel from here to the\nrocks and shallow pool below. <strong><em>(Length uncertain –\napproximately 20-25 meters?)<strong>''</strong>Rappel 16<strong>Some\nmore downclimbing leads to a view down into the bottom of Box Creek, and\nthe lower reaches of Monmouth. Undulating slabs of granite, with varied\nangles, scoops, pools and streams stretch down to the bottom. Some of\nthe creek splits off to the right, joining Box Creek above the actual\nconfluence. The downclimbing is initially easier here on canyon right,\nand may in fact continue all the way down to Box without requiring a\nrappel (though it’s unlikely). The final rappel of the main canyon is on\nthe left, past a series of scoops and cascades, anchored o webbing in\na pinch on the left side of a chockstone. The rappel goes down a narrow\ncorridor, but it’s easy to stay out of the full flow.</strong></em>12m\n(40 feet)</strong>'' to slabs which can be followed to the right, all\nthe way to the confluence with Box, and an exit to the trail.</p>\n<p><strong>GPS Waypoints</strong></p>\n<p>Upper canoe put-in: 49.719579 -123.167867</p>\n<p>Lower canoe put-in: 49.715572 -123.167973</p>\n<p>Take-out canoe: 49.707469 -123.170288</p>\n<p>Trailhead landing: 49.713905 -123.173527</p>\n<p>Trail turns uphill 49.713249 -123.181175</p>\n<p>Keep right: 49.713478 -123.184620</p>\n<p>Normal entry: 49.715020 -123.187978</p>\n<p>Upper entry: 49.715059 -123.191296</p>\n<p>Monmouth-Box confluence: 49.712734 -123.18177</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>There are several options to exit after the famous Keyhole rappel in\ncase members of the group or cold, tired, or nightfall is approaching.\nAfter the Keyhole rappel, there are 3-4 more rappels before reaching the\ncreek bottom.
