  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>Located in a pretty forest glade, a small pool is fed by the only\ntrue geyser in Colorado. Natural mineral water fill the pools of this\nunique Hot Spring.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>Directions to trailhead: From the town of Dolores, head east on\nHighway 145 for 12 miles to junction of NFSR (National Forest Service\nRoad) #535. Turn left and travel 23.3 miles. The parking area is on the\nright side NFSR #535 (this is a new trailhead). The trailhead is 2.2\nmiles south of the town of Dunton.</p>\n<p>Trail Description: Beginning at the newly constructed parking area,\nthe Geyser Spring Trail starts by crossing the West Dolores River. There\nis currently no foot bridge across the river on Forest Service Land, so\nit is important you wait for high water levels to drop before attempting\nto hike this trail. Spring runoff is not a good time to attempt this\nhike. There are rocks, however, that have been strategically placed for\nyour convenience. Please watch small children carefully. Hikers are\nencouraged to respect adjacent land ownerâ€™s private property and not\ntrespass across their bridge. The trail rises approximately 500 feet in\nelevation from its beginning to end. There are several relatively gently\nsloped switchbacks that take you through a series of small meadows and\naspen stands. Evidence of mining activity is apparent in the area.</p>\n<p>The trail ends up at a small warm pool fed by the only true geyser in\nthe state of Colorado. Although the frequency of the eruptions varies,\n30 to 40 minute intervals are most common. The action is slight and\nboils 12 to 15 minutes emitting strong sulfur gases. The temperature of\nthe spring is 82.4 degrees Fahrenheit which is not the ideal temperature\nfor soaking.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a\nhref=\"http://4cornershikesdol.blogspot.com/2009/08/geyser-springs-trail.html\">Blogspot.com</a></li>\n<li>[<a\nhref=\"http://www.fs.usda.gov/wps/portal/fsinternet/!ut/p/c4/04_SB8K8xLLM9MSSzPy8xBz9CP0os3gDfxMDT8MwRydLA1cj72BTJw8jAwjQL8h2VAQAzHJMsQ\">http://www.fs.usda.gov/wps/portal/fsinternet/!ut/p/c4/04_SB8K8xLLM9MSSzPy8xBz9CP0os3gDfxMDT8MwRydLA1cj72BTJw8jAwjQL8h2VAQAzHJMsQ</a>!!?ss=110213&amp;ttype=recarea&amp;recid=42932&amp;actid=104&amp;navtype=BROWSEBYSUBJECT&amp;position=BROWSEBYSUBJECT&amp;navid=110000000000000&amp;pnavid=&amp;cid=null&amp;pname=Dolores+RD+-+Geyser+Spring+Trail+(648)\nUS Forest Service]</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n",
