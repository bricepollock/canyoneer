  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>The bridge over Pine Creek is 450ft tall and based on two hollow\nconcrete structures that support each traffic lane. These structures\nprovide access to vantage points from where to run a 300+ft fully aerial\nrappel, which is the main attraction of this destination.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>DO NOT PARK ON THE HIGHWAY! You will get ticketed, towed, arrested or\nworse. Park at any of the valid parking spots indicated in the map:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>1/2 mile one way (RECOMMENDED): off a dead end dirt road accesible\n1/2 mile from Pine Valley exit driving WEST</li>\n<li>1 mile one way: south of Pine Valley accesible from Pine Valley exit\nand driving through town and south under a bridge</li>\n</ul>\n<p>After parking walk roughly along the highway bushwacking your way\nthrough and making sure you stay way off the pavement. There's a paved\nshoulder/emergency lane plus another dirt shoulder, you may stay at the\nouter skirts of the dirt edge and be able to safely access the bridge\nwithout disrupting traffic.</p>\n<p>It is possible to hike from Corte Madera Road (~1 mile away) using\ncow trails/illegal immigrant trails to get to Pine Creek but the\nbushwhacking is terribly unpleasant.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><ul>\n<li>If you think parking and hiking along the highway seems sketchy,\nthen:</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Park at the nearby Pine Creek trailhead (adventure pass required) and\nhike in on the trail. After maybe 1.5 miles (?) you'll go through a gate\non the trail. Hike a little bit more until it goes back down to the\nriver and cross it here (you'll likely see a wrecked orange truck on the\nother side up the hill). Scramble up past this truck until you get up to\nthe west-end side of the bridge. Enter either bridge (if the manhole is\nbolted shut, then try to squeeze through the expansion gap around the\ncorner from the manhole).</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>Enter the bridge tunnels through manholes under the concrete\nstructures located at either corner of the bridge (SW, NW, SE, NE) or\nsqueeze through the expansion joints located at each corner. Once inside\nfind one of the gaps in the concrete, set up anchor and rappel down it.\nThere's 4 possible rappeling location, the tallest rappel is probably on\nthe South West side, and the second tallest is the South East side. They\nseemed all to be the same size, but things may change seasonally.</p>\n<p>These gaps ARE TIGHT. You can test yourself through the expansion\njoints before going through the rappel gaps. If you fit in those you\nwill fit in the other. NOTE: The expansion joints are tighter on the\nEAST side of the bridge.</p>\n<p>This is a 300' drop with an awkward start, so we recommend the\nfollowing precautions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>make absolutely sure the rope reaches the bottom (tie a carabiner or\nrope bag to the end)</li>\n<li>wear a low profile harness with just a descender and take EVERYTHING\nelse out</li>\n<li>be on belay while going through the squeeze and disconnect once past\nit</li>\n<li>rig the rope so that it hangs freely in the middle of the hole</li>\n<li>rig the anchor ready for raise, in case someone gets stuck</li>\n<li>go through the squeeze feet first with the rappel side facing away\nfrom the wall</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>Follow use trails to climb back up to the top of the hill, go back\ninside the concrete structures, retrieve your rope and anchor equipment\nand go back the way you came.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<p>The only rules and regulation currently posted at the bridge are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Parking areas adjacent to the bridge are for EMERGENCY PARKING\nONLY</li>\n<li>Pedestrians are prohibited on the bridge (because there is no\nshoulder)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Please respect these rules to avoid getting a ticket or force\nauthorities to unnecessarily close access to the bridge.</p>\n<p>You will not disrupt traffic in any way. You will access the rappel\nby walking INSIDE the structures located BELOW the traffic lanes,\ncompletely out of sight from transiting vehicles. The only people that\nmay potentially see you rappeling are hikers on the Pine Valley hiking\ntrail that runs right under the bridge, but this is almost always\ndeserted.</p>\n<p>The inside of the bridge has been used as shelter by countless\nswallows, bats, and possibly illegal immigrants... please leave the\npremises in the same state you found them so that they can keep coming\nback.</p>\n<p>If you want to get into serious cave/mine exploration, join some\nSoCal experienced underground exploring group such as the <a\nhref=\"http://www.southerncaliforniagrotto.com/\">SoCal Grotto</a> or the\n<a href=\"http://www.sdgrotto.com/\">San Diego Grotto</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a\nhref=\"https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.10153050224541103&amp;type=1&amp;l=1cc29494a8\">Facebook\nAlbum Jan 2015</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n<p>More information on the bridge available at <a\nhref=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pine_Valley_Creek_Bridge\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pine_Valley_Creek_Bridge</a></p>\n",
