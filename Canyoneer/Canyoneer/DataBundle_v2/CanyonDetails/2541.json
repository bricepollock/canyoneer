  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>This is a great canyon that has 10 rappels and 10 jump/slides. The\ntechnical section of the canyon is very good, but relatively short\ncompared to the total length of the hike. Small experienced groups might\ndescend it in one long day, but most groups will opt for the two day\noption.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>An alternative to the approach described in the beta is to start with\n<a href=\"Stony_Creek\" title=\"wikilink\">Stony_Creek</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>Is it a jump? This canyon has more jumps than most into dark waters.\nEfficient meat anchors sending someone down to check the jump area will\nbe the theme of the day. Goggles may not be a bad idea. Well placed\nbolts and pins are available at most anchors with the occasional natural\nanchor. Carrying lots of webbing between the group and many\nrapides/rappel rings is a good idea.</p>\n<p>Dorst and Stony Creek are the two entry options you have for\naccessing Upper Kaweah. Stony has better parking and a bathroom. Having\ndone both I find them equally fun with no real winner. Dorst requires\nshorter ropes which minimizes your weight in Upper Kaweah. *Safety note,\nthe last drop in Dorst is a jump with dire consequences if you slip\nwhile trying to access the edge. Please use extreme caution here. After\nthe jump you meet the confluence where Dorst and Stony meet to begin the\nUpper Kaweah River.</p>\n<p>Rappels 5 and 6 pose the most technical part of the day. Rappel 5\ndrops 12' into a small bowl of swirling water. The first person down\nmust then maneuver near the water's edge and crawl up to the bolts. The\nedge can be mossy and slippery. Being swept over the edge attempting to\ngain access to the bolts is a real hazard and the person above you\nmanning the contingency anchor better be ready to lower you if you fall\nover the edge while still on rope.</p>\n<p>The bolts here at Rappel 6 can be missing or damaged. Be prepared\nwith a back up plan should they be missing. You can safely view them\nfrom atop Rappel 5.</p>\n<p>After Rappel 8 you can see a granite slab at the river's edge. This\nis NOT the bivy. Continue past the obvious granite slab approximately 65\nfeet. On the right hand side of the river will be a smaller granite slab\nand a fire ring behind it with a canopy of oak trees. This is the bivy\nprevious parties have used to break the canyon into two days. There are\ninfinite places to bivy based on time, party size, and how much you like\nants.</p>\n<p>Enjoy a nice fire and the sounds of the river as you drift into a\nwell deserved slumber. Do not be surprised to be visited by grey kit\nfoxes during the night. Use SEKI (Sequoia and Kings Canyon National\nPark) approved bear storage techniques and abide by seasonal fire\nrestrictions.</p>\n<p>This is a true 'wilderness canyon' with large sections of boulder\nhopping and scrambling. This canyon is not recommended for the weekender\ncanyoneer who enjoys a Sunday jaunt down 7 tea cups. It is physically\ndemanding and technical. Expect to finish in two full days. Reaching\nFish Camp in a single day would require an alpine start and the extra\ndaylight given by summer. Those wanting to complete it in a single day\nbest be prepared for a shiver bivy.</p>\n<p>Canyon comparisons to help you judge whether to attept this\ncanyon.Upper Kaweah is on par physically with Fish Fork and technically\nmore difficult. Upper Kaweah is harder than Heaps in easy full pot hole\nmode.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>You can exit as described in the beta or keep going and do <a\nhref=\"North_Fork_Kaweah_River_(Lower)\"\ntitle=\"wikilink\">North_Fork_Kaweah_River_(Lower)</a></p>\n<p>Rappel 11? Those not wanting to do the last walk around the large\nwaterfall can opt to rappel using a double pinch located 15 feet canyon\nleft of the water course. The large pool below has an obvious fish camp\non canyon left. The trail up to Cherry Flat starts about 40 feet on the\nright side. The trail is somewhat overgrown and occasionally pruned by\nunknown fisherman. The trail has some poison oak which can be avoided by\ngoing slow and watching carefully. Approximately 100 feet up the trail,\nright after you step over the Redwood Creek is a large granite slab.\nThis is a great place to remove wet suits, repack, and dawn your dry\nhiking clothes.</p>\n<p>The Cherry Flat exit is a decent trail leading up the hillside to a\ndirt road. The road is overgrown with manzanita, poison oak, and dead\ntrees. It is advisable to have a high clearance 4x4 or a spirited driver\nin a Subaru Forester. If you choose to do this canyon early in the\nseason, do not be surprised to find downed trees across the road. There\nis a nice turn out to park your vehicle at 36.62962°N 118.89955°W,\nelevation 4,242 ft. There is no cell service here so plan ahead.</p>\n<p>Off-roading clubs generally possess the skills and vehicles required\nto safely clear a road with chainsaws and winches. Some clubs like LA\nCounty Trailcrew 4x4 club provide occasional training and are familiar\nwith canyoneering.</p>\n<p>Some have recommended a shorter shuttle route via Redwood Saddle\nthrough <a\nhref=\"https://forests.berkeley.edu/forests/whitaker\">Whitaker's\nForest</a> but which Google Maps does not readily offer.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<p>Local land owners do not appreciate the random vehicle parked on the\npublic road next to their house. Be prepared for angry individuals\nthreatening to have your car towed. Plan ahead where you choose to leave\nexit vehicles and do your best to respect the privacy of locals.</p>\n<p>Parties driving up Friday evening at different times may choose to\nmeet at Eshom Point OHV area. It has two pit toilets and a large dirt\nlot. Here you have cell service and can check in with your group and\nloved ones.</p>\n<p>Eshom point down to Cherry Flats will routinely have cattle grazing.\nPlease be alert and keep your speed on the dirt road reasonable. You\npass by a few private properties when going down to Cherry Flat so\nplease keep your noise level down if it's late in the evening.</p>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Beta was originally posted on sierracanyons.org (now defunct), <a\nhref=\"Media:North_Fork_Kaweah_River_(Upper).pdf\" title=\"wikilink\"> Open\nPDF</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<p>{{#ev:vimeo|49301061}}</p>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n<p>First descent was lead by Jef Levin, the original date and\ncircumstances of the event are unknown</p>\n",
