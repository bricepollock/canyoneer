Soaking most of the way down on rappel. What more is there to say. This is a unique experience on a worldwide basis. Highly recommended to hire the local guide service as the multi-pitch 740 foot sequence has several hanging anchor stations, getting a rope stuck or core shot would be disastrous. Sequencing every pitch with the correct rope length must be done at the very top.\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Hike 1 mile through light bush to the start of the drainage (-14.63056,-47.41960).\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Entry sequence of short rappels is a nice warm up. This is followed by creek walking for 500m then 3km of trail on creek right. This brings you to an affinity pool and the big show-stopper, the 240m (740ft) falls, start with a 3m traverse line to a 70m rappel. Longest single pitch is 100m. BE SURE TO HAVE A 330 FOOT ROPE AND PLENTY OF EXTRA IN CASE OF ROPE STUCK. At bottom of 70m there is a 1m wide deck for up to 10 people with a safety line to clip into. Next is 100m rappel followed by a series of smaller rappels most of which have hanging anchors with minimal footing if any. BEST PRACTICE IS TO TIE J-TIES ON ALL BIG WALL RAPPELS so passengers do not rappel of the end of the rope.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Go for a swim.
