The main falls are about 400 feet tall but the bottom is not visible from the river. The creek and drainage are not named on any maps that this author has seen.   <style data-mw-deduplicate=\"TemplateStyles:r1062633282\">@media all and (max-width:720px){.mw-parser-output .content .thumb>div:not(.thumbinner){display:flex;justify-content:center;flex-wrap:wrap;align-content:flex-start;flex-direction:column}}body.skin-vector .mw-parser-output div.thumb>div:not(.thumbinner){font-size:94%;text-align:center;overflow:hidden;min-width:100px}body.skin-minerva .mw-parser-output div.thumb>div:not(.thumbinner){margin:0 auto;max-width:100%!important}<\/style> \n<\/p>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\">\n<div style=\"display:table;\">\n<span class=\"mw-default-size\" typeof=\"mw:Error mw:File\/Frameless\">\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>Clarence Quigley was the Kings River hermit who inhabited the area until the 1980's.  Hermits Hole put in is named for him, so it seem appropriate to give these falls his true name.\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>From Kirch Flat campground on the Kings River drive upstream to the steel bridge, cross to the north side, then turn upstream onto a dirt road.  Travel 5.29 miles to where the road dips to cross the creek.  There is enough room to pull off the road, just beyond.  Hike up the ridge on the east side of the creek.  Gain 1400 feet in a half mile, then traverse left into the drainage.  Drop down to the creek and enjoy the area.  A pretty and walkable mini gorge is a short ways upstream.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Heading downstream, the first waterfall is probably less than 200 feet high.  R1 a large horn on DRL can be slung and extended towards the drop. There is a blocky ledge about 2\/3s of the way down. Land in a shallow pool surrounded by trees.  Wander downstream till open slabs signal the top of Quigley Falls.  You can walk and butt scoot down the right side of the slabs, or you may wish to rap or belay the last distance to the rap anchors.  At the rap anchors there is a fairly large relatively level area. R3 DCR 200 feet, from 2 bolt station.  R4 - 200'  DCR 2 bolt station on nice ledge. The lower part of this rap is lower angle and lands at the bottom of the waterfall.  Follow the creek down to some small drop offs. R4 Loop the rope over a big midstream boulder and rap 40 or 50 feet to get past a couple of drop offs and a slippery slab.  Follow the creek out to the road.\n<\/p><p><a href=\"\/w\/index.php?title=Template:Pics&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Template:Pics (page does not exist)\">Template:Pics<\/a>\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Red_tape\">Red tape<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Beta_sites\">Beta sites<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Background\">Background<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>The cliff band here is visible to every whitewater boater who launches at Hermit's Hole or comes down the river past here and by every fisherman and camper in the area.  It is enticing, but seems so high up and far away.  In fact, the base is only 1\/4 mile from the road!!\n<\/p><p>The waterfall is generally not visible except in the winter during and after rainstorms.  There is likely some flow into early June, but the creek probably dries up each summer.  The route will be much to hot in summer, so will likely be of most interest to canyoneers who are also boating on the river in early spring.\n<\/p><p>The hike to the base of the falls from the road is relatively short, interesting, but weedy and requires some route finding, some poison oak avoidance and some scrambling near the cliff.  From the base of the falls a 3rd class climbing route ascends to the right. It is weedy and loose lower down, but has excellent climbing up high, up a prominent rib.  Ledges lead back left to the top of the falls. Also from the base, a one pitch, bolted climbing route reaches about halfway up the falls (5.7? rating).  A second pitch to the top is unfinished. \n<\/p><p>Paul Martzen and Bill Murphy explored this canyon in May of 2018\n<\/p>\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nParsed by mw‐api‐ext.codfw.main‐6779cc57fc‐587wj\nCached time: 20240914191825\nCache expiry: 2592000\nReduced expiry: false\nComplications: [show‐toc]\nCPU time usage: 0.032 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.043 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 117\/1000000\nPost‐expand include size: 722\/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 53\/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 8\/100\nExpensive parser function count: 0\/500\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0\/20\nUnstrip post‐expand size: 529\/5000000 bytes\nLua time usage: 0.002\/10.000 seconds\nLua memory usage: 606898\/52428800 bytes\nNumber of Wikibase entities loaded: 0\/400\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%   32.776      1 -total\n 87.50%   28.678      1 Template:Pic\n 46.65%   15.289      1 Template:Str_number\/trim\n 12.16%    3.985      1 Template:Pics\n-->\n<\/div>","timeRating":"II","geojson":null,"version":"4de8ebb2525fc416d368e063b38096b60e8222238c795e64c9af3584fb64efa8","vehicle":null,"riskRating":null,"url":"https:\/\/ropewiki.com\/Quigley_Creek_Falls","shuttleSeconds":null,"permit":"Closed","longitude":-119.0581,"id":52168,"rappelCountMax":5}
