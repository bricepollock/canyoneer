  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>Five Falls canyon, were it near a road, would be a brief but\nexcellent canyon. However, the miles of thorny and truly impressively\nthick bushwhacking and deadfall hopping required relegates this canyon\nto those few who will enjoy the whole journey, pain and all. Were the\nPeralta trail ever repaired, this would surely be a canyon not to\nmiss.</p>\n<p>Even during a dry July, there was constant flow. Google earth imaging\nshows significant flow during spring runoff.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>Starting on FS road 266 (Blocked by deadfall several miles west of\nthe ridge), follow Peralta Ridge Trail (The trail no longer exists, and\nyou will be bushwhacking). Once in Peralta Canyon proper, climb\nover/under constant deadfall for two miles until you reach the\nnarrows.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>Flowing canyon of slippery when wet granite. Natural anchor solutions\nto be had, 3-4 raps.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>Once you exit the narrows, scramble directly north up ~100ft of\nscree, and side slope until back in the watercourse above narrows.\nFollow approach footprints back to vehicle.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<p>All forest service, no red tape.</p>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n"
