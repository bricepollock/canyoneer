  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>Camp Creek was overrun by the Eagle Creek wildfire in Sept 2017.\nWhile the area has reopened and it's possible to run the canyon, the\narea is still very unstable. Expect lots of woody debris and loose rocks\nin the creek. It's not nearly as nice as it was pre-fire.</p>\n<p>Short &amp; sweet objective on a minor tributary of Herman Creek.\nCamp is usually \"open for business\" relatively early in the season,\nalthough be aware that it dumps into Herman Creek which will always be\nrunning much higher. Camp is a good creek for beginners. Requires some\namount of navigation / bushwhacking to exit. A good creek for training\nbeginners.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Watershed: 0.6mi^2. (This does not take Herman Creek into account\nwhich will be running much higher.)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>Drive up through the Herman Creek campground and continue bearing\nright at all junctions to find the trailhead. (The road into the\ncampground is closed/gated in the winter season. If the gate is closed,\nyou can park just on Frontage Rd adjacent to the gate. It's a 5min hike\nup to the trailhead.)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Parking down on Frontage Road may be preferred as this trailhead is\nknown for car break-ins. Do not leave any valuables or things that look\npotentially valuable in your car.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Follow trail 406 until it intersects Camp Creek (~2.5mi). It takes\nabout 1-1.5hrs. Bring a map as there are several junctions. Beware\npoison oak along the trail. Start your descent down a small, brushy\ncreek until you reach the first rappel in about 15min. There is a lot of\nnew debris in the creek post-fire.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>R1: Multi-tier: 35ft to a platform, then another 35ft to the bottom.\nAnchor DCL on a still-living tree. 100ft of rope (single strand) is\nrequired for both drops due to the horizontal distance.</p>\n<p>Immediately below the rappel is a short 6ft drop. Can body anchor it\nor downclimb DCL.</p>\n<p>R2: 50'. Anchor off a tree DCR atop a small cascade that precedes the\nwaterfall. Rappel right down through the flow.</p>\n<p>R3: 30'. Anchor off a tree DCR well out of the creek. This rappel\ndrops into an ankle deep pool of Herman Creek.</p>\n<p>Be aware, Herman Creek can run very high in the early season and has\na LOT more flow than Camp Creek. There is a 20ft falls just upstream of\nthe confluence on Herman Creek. If it's a nice day, it's worth the\ndetour to go see it. (This is the exit from the Herman Creek\nnarrows.)</p>\n<p>Early in the season, there may be a short swim downstream of the\nconfluence.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>The exit is an off-trail bushwhack and takes, perhaps, 30min. From\nCamp Creek, continue down Herman Creek about five minutes until it's\neasy to exit up the bank DCR. If it's not easy, you haven't gone far\nenough. Climb up onto a relatively flat forested bench. This is a good\nplace to de-wetsuit. (This is the same exit as Camp Creek.)</p>\n<p>Don't attempt to go directly uphill back to the trail per cliffs. The\neasiest route is follow the bench northwards staying about the same\nelevation until you reach a small crest just before the next unnamed\ntributary creek to the north. From here turn right and make your way up\nto regain the trail. This is the best route out with minimal elevation\ngain, but the area is full of briars that have grown up post-fire, so\nyou'll need to thread your way through. Try to avoid gaining elevation\ntoo early, however.</p>\n<p>Once back on the trail, return the way you came.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<p>Northwest Forest Pass is required to park at the Herman Creek\ntrailhead.</p>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><img src=\"rwl_en.png\" title=\"rwl_en.png\" alt=\"rwl_en.png\" /><a\nhref=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20210527212206/www.canyoneeringnorthwest.com/CampCreek/Camp_Creek.php\">CanyoneeringNorthwest.com\n(archive.org)</a> : Camp Creek</li>\n<li><img src=\"rwl_en.png\" title=\"rwl_en.png\" alt=\"rwl_en.png\" /><a\nhref=\"http://ropewiki.com/User:Super_Amazing_Map?id=Camp_Creek_-_Oregon\">Super\nAmazing Map</a> : Camp Creek</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><img src=\"rwl_en.png\" title=\"rwl_en.png\" alt=\"rwl_en.png\" /><a\nhref=\"http://karl-helser.com/camp-creek-canyoneer-5-10-15\">Karl Helser's\nNW Adventures</a> : Camp Creek Canyoneer 5-10-15</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n",
