While the area has reopened and it's possible to run the canyon, the area is still very unstable. Expect lots of woody debris and loose rocks in the creek. It's not nearly as nice as it was pre-fire.\n<\/p><p>Short &amp; sweet objective on a minor tributary of Herman Creek.  Camp is usually \"open for business\" relatively early in the season, although be aware that it dumps into Herman Creek which will always be running much higher.  Camp is a good creek for beginners.  Requires some amount of navigation \/ bushwhacking to exit.  A good creek for training beginners.\n<\/p>\n<ul><li>Watershed: 0.6mi^2. (This does not take Herman Creek into account which will be running much higher.)<\/li><\/ul>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Drive up through the Herman Creek campground and continue bearing right at all junctions to find the trailhead.  (The road into the campground is closed\/gated in the winter season.  If the gate is closed, you can park just on Frontage Rd adjacent to the gate.  It's a 5min hike up to the trailhead.)\n<\/p>\n<ul><li>Parking down on Frontage Road may be preferred as this trailhead is known for car break-ins. Do not leave any valuables or things that look potentially valuable in your car.<\/li><\/ul>\n<p>Follow trail 406 until it intersects Camp Creek (~2.5mi). It takes about 1-1.5hrs. Bring a map as there are several junctions.  Beware poison oak along the trail.  Start your descent down a small, brushy creek until you reach the first rappel in about 15min.  There is a lot of new debris in the creek post-fire.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>R1: Multi-tier: 35ft to a platform, then another 35ft to the bottom.  Anchor DCL on a still-living tree.  100ft of rope (single strand) is required for both drops due to the horizontal distance.\n<\/p><p>Immediately below the rappel is a short 6ft drop.  Can body anchor it or downclimb DCL.\n<\/p><p>R2: 50'.  Anchor off a tree DCR atop a small cascade that precedes the waterfall.  Rappel right down through the flow.\n<\/p><p>R3: 30'.  Anchor off a tree DCR well out of the creek. This rappel drops into an ankle deep pool of Herman Creek.\n<\/p><p>Be aware, Herman Creek can run very high in the early season and has a LOT more flow than Camp Creek.  There is a 20ft falls just upstream of the confluence on Herman Creek.  If it's a nice day, it's worth the detour to go see it. (This is the exit from the Herman Creek narrows.)\n<\/p><p>Early in the season, there may be a short swim downstream of the confluence.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>The exit is an off-trail bushwhack and takes, perhaps, 30min. From Camp Creek, continue down Herman Creek about five minutes until it's easy to exit up the bank DCR. If it's not easy, you haven't gone far enough. Climb up onto a relatively flat forested bench. This is a good place to de-wetsuit. (This is the same exit as Camp Creek.)\n<\/p><p>Don't attempt to go directly uphill back to the trail per cliffs. The easiest route is follow the bench northwards staying about the same elevation until you reach a small crest just before the next unnamed tributary creek to the north. From here turn right and make your way up to regain the trail. This is the best route out with minimal elevation gain, but the area is full of briars that have grown up post-fire, so you'll need to thread your way through. Try to avoid gaining elevation too early, however. \n<\/p><p>Once back on the trail, return the way you came.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Red_tape\">Red tape<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Northwest Forest Pass is required to park at the Herman Creek trailhead.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Beta_sites\">Beta sites<\/h2><\/div>\n<ul><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20210527212206\/www.canyoneeringnorthwest.com\/CampCreek\/Camp_Creek.php\">CanyoneeringNorthwest.com (archive.org)<\/a> &#160;: Camp Creek<\/li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http:\/\/ropewiki.com\/User:Super_Amazing_Map?id=Camp_Creek_-_Oregon\">Super Amazing Map<\/a> &#160;: Camp Creek<\/li><\/ul>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media<\/h2><\/div>\n<ul><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http:\/\/karl-helser.com\/camp-creek-canyoneer-5-10-15\">Karl Helser's NW Adventures<\/a> &#160;: Camp Creek Canyoneer 5-10-15<\/li><\/ul>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Background\">Background<\/h2><\/div>\n\n\n<\/div>","rappelLongestMeters":15.24,"permit":"No","name":"Camp Creek","rappelCountMin":3}
