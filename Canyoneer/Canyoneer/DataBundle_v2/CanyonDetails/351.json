{"rappelCountMax":23,"shuttleSeconds":null,"longitude":-112.9606,"riskRating":"R","rappelCountMin":18,"description":"<div class=\"mw-content-ltr mw-parser-output\" lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><p>Imlay Canyon is one of the most difficult canyons in Zion due to its approach, technical potholes which often require specialized equipment and techniques to escape, and prolonged exposure to cold water.  Be sure to read <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http:\/\/www.canyoneeringusa.com\/utah\/zion\/technical\/preface\/imlay-sneak-route\/\">Tom Jones' preface to Imlay and Heaps<\/a> before attempting this canyon as it is a step above most other Zion canyons in difficulty.\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Start at the Grotto shuttle stop and head toward Angel's Landing.  Scout's Lookout is just after Walter's Wiggles, a set of 20  steep switchbacks; at this point, continue up the West Rim trail.  Continue on the West Rim trail until it starts to descend and you cross a brige.  About 1000ft after the bridge, turn off the trail to the right at a large pine tree and cross the drainage below.  Contour along the left (west) wall as far as possible and then descend slightly to the drainage below.  Cross the drainage and climb the ridge that separates two separate drainages running north and find a use trail along the top of the ridge heading north.  When you reach a wall where the ridge becomes very steep, drop down into the drainage on the right (east) and continue north up the water course and on small use trails.  After about 220ft of elevation gain, reach a saddle and descend briefly then continue past the drainage exiting to the right -- this is Not Imlay.  Shortly after, ascend a somewhat tricky upclimb with a small use trail on the right, then a tree on the right side of the climb.  Continue upward for about 180ft of additional elevation gain until you reach another saddle.  Continue down the drainage keeping your eye on the right side.  When the terrain permits, contour onto the sandstone out of the drainage onto a large area of solid sandstone with a towering wall running east-west on the far side of Imlay Canyon.  Head just right of the sharp right-hand bend in the canyon after it gets narrow and look for a cairn, possibly with a sandal on it.  Continue your descent to the canyon bottom where you should find a broad, flat area of sand with somewhat over hanging rock.  If taking 2 days, bivy here.  You should reach this point 3.5-5.5 hours after starting.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>The number of rappels will vary greatly depending on your conditions and your group's ability to downclimb. For most, 23 rappels. 14 in upper section. 9 in lower section. Second biggest rappel is about 60 feet which is the second to last rappel. Before this, next or third biggest rappel is about 45 feet.\n<\/p><p>Downclimb and rappel a number of obstacles in well-lit semi-narrows.  One of the obstacles near the beginning of this section is a logjam that can be difficult to swim through and to climb.\n<\/p><p>After a while, enter a set of very dark narrows.  After a few rappels, there will be a rappel that heads RDC initially and then turns LDC to open into a pool.  This is the first technical pothole and may require special equipment and techniques to escape -- be sure not to send too many people down before someone has escaped, and be sure to have the means to bring people back up to the top of the rappel to warm up if escape proves difficult.  After this pothole, a series of additional challenges follows before this narrow section ends.\n<\/p><p>Continue down more open canyon until the start of another set of dark narrows.  After a few rappels, the narrows become brighter and there is a sequence of potholes, two of which may require technical escapes.  The longest rappel so far leads to a short hallway at the end of which the final rappel into the Narrows begins.  Rappel 120ft into the Narrows, likely in view of a number of tourists.\n<\/p><p>The technical descent will likely take at least 4 hours.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Pack up and head down the Narrows 1.5-2 hours to the Temple of Sinawava.  Take the shuttle back to your car.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Red_tape\">Red tape<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Permits are required and reservations are available at the Zion website.  Permits must be picked up in person at the backcountry desk unless the reservations are made using an Express account, which can only be acquired by watching 30 minutes of videos in person at the backcountry desk.\n<\/p><p>If attempting the trip in a single day, ask for a White Pass that will allow you to park at the Grotto before the buses start running.  The White Pass will only be given in person at the Zion backcountry desk the day before your trip.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Beta_sites\">Beta
