  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>This is a brushy \"technical bushwack\" approach followed by a\nbeautiful and deep aquatic canyon. This is ejido land so ask permission\nfrom anyone you encounter and explain to them what you are doing. Better\nyet, contact Enock of Club Xel, the guy who opened all the canyons in\nthe area. He'll house and feed you and give you all the info you need.\nReally helps to speak some Spanish.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>After leaving the labeled roads above the drop-in, you follow the\ndirt roads as close to the drop-in as is feasible. The approach on the\nkml map may include some nuisance rappels. The labelled \"Better\nEntrance\" is a trail coming in RDC that would likely be a better\napproach (less bushwacking) if someone can figure out where this trail\nstarts</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>The point on the map is where a trail comes down to Chifloncito, but\nwe haven't yet found the top of this trail. The part above it sucks,\nwith alot of bushwacking and some brushy rappels. The part below has\nseveral rappels and a bunch of downclimbing. There are some cool chutes\nthat go through tunnels of vegetation. The highlight is a 50 meter rap\ndown a sloping, sculpted water fall. Aside from this and a couple other\ninteresting sections, the route is mostly way to access lower Chiflon.\nOnce in here, the flow is much higher and it starts to get good. There\nare 7 rappels in Chiflon, one of which (R5?) can be quite intense at\nhigher flows and has a pasamano LDC to get you out of the flow. It has 3\npoints and is exposed so you have to know how to rig a retrievable\nhandline to use this. The canyon ends when you reach the bridge. The\nlast 5 rappels take you through a gorgeous and deep canyon with clear\nwater and plants hanging from the walls.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>If you haven't left a vehicle at the bridge or arranged a pick up,\nyou can try hitchhiking like we did (successfully).</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<p>It is best to get in touch with Enock of Club Xel (+52 55 4766 1825)\nto do these Agua Blanca canyons. He will set you up with sweet food and\naccommodation and maybe help with shuttles. If he's around, he might go\nwith you. This is mostly ejidal land and it really is best to know a\nlocal. At least, explain what you're doing to anyone you come across and\nask if it's ok if you continue. Should speak some Spanish.</p>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n",
