Exit trail right (east) up steep ridge. Contour around Superstition Peak. Head down drainage.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>The canyon starts with some brush and a few downclimbs.\n<\/p><p>Be aware that much of the volcanic rock in the Superstition Wilderness is poor quality - use caution, particularly when downclimbing.\n<\/p><p><b>R1:<\/b> 50’ off of tree.\n<\/p><p><b>R2:<\/b> 225' off of large boulder.\n<\/p><p><b>R3:<\/b> 80' off of large boulder. First section can be down climbed to thick grass, but nothing to anchor off of on second drop.\n<\/p><p><b>R4:<\/b> 20' into pool. Possible to bypass LDC or depending on water level may be avoidable with some bridging skills.\n<\/p><p><b>R5:<\/b> 135' off of rock pinch into pool. Drops to first section about 60', but continues down a second drop around a corner about 50' (into another pool).\n<\/p><p><b>R6:<\/b> 270' off of bush backed up by boulder. Extend webbing to lip for a smooth pull. Feet are on wall for the entire rappel.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Follow canyon down. There is less brush outside of the drainage. A trail with cairns meanders RDC. You may follow it a short distance to avoid some brush, but do not stray too far as it leads up and away from the drainage.\n<\/p><p>The drainage eventually crosses Lost Goldmine Trail. Follow the trail back to the parking area.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Red_tape\">Red tape<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Beta_sites\">Beta
