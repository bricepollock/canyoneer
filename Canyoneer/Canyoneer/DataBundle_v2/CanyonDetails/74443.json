Towards the end is a cave with waterflow that has\nbeen partially explored.</p>\n<p>The canyon is below a southfacing glacier, it has happened before\nthat the flow went from a few litres per second to more that a cubic\nmeter. It's not easy to find the right flow for this one.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<p>Picture Credits : Georgi Perren</p>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n",
