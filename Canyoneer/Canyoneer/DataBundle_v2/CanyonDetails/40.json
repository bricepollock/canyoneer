  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>Eaton Canyon is one of the crown jewels of the <a\nhref=\"San_Gabriel_Mountains\" title=\"wikilink\">San Gabriels</a> in Los\nAngeles and the area-favorite of many. It has a lot of water for the\narea which transforms its many smooth granite slides into a natural\nwater park during most of the year. The rappels are relatively straight\nforward and not very tall, but the watery conditions and sheer length of\nthe whole canyon can cause many problems for groups who are not\nwell-practiced and well-prepared. In high-flow conditions, Eaton can\nbecome a difficult <a href=\"ACA_rating\" title=\"wikilink\">class C</a>\ncanyon.</p>\n<p>Eaton Canyon is often in the local news for accidents and deaths\noccurring primarily when non-canyoneers bypass the final few waterfalls\nusing exposed or non-existent trails, and when groups find themselves\nunprepared for Eaton’s substantially larger commitment as compared to\nother nearby canyons.</p>\n<p>This canyon is rated B, but in good springs this canyon becomes a\nclass C and in good water years it can become a killer. In general, if\nthe first pool where you start the descent is ALL whitewater, the canyon\nis at EXTREME levels and should be tacked only by expert canyoneers that\nknow the canyon well.</p>\n<h3 id=\"eatons_flow_gauge\">Eaton's \"flow gauge\"</h3>\n<p>After years of collecting data from canyoneers and pictures of the\nsmall dam (see pictures below) just upstream of the Mt Wilson Toll Road\nbridge, here is how you objectively rate Eaton's waterflow: Spend a few\nminutes before your trip and hike to the bridge, down underneath it, and\nup stream to view the small dam. When all water is going the trough on\nthe climber's left side (IE facing upstream toward the dam), the flow is\n\"moderate\". When the water is spilling into the slight depression in the\nmiddle, it's moving to high. When the water is filling that middle\ndepression, then it's \"very high\". When it's all the way across, it's\n\"extreme\". When it's thick all the way across, it's \"extreme plus\".</p>\n<p><br />\n<br />\nWhat level of flow is OK to run depends greatly on the canyoneers' swift\nwater skills, willingness to use alternate rig points (or even bypass\nwaterfalls using the bypass trails) and the amount of sediment in the\nslide pools and waterfall pools. In recent years the slide pools have\nbeen so full of sediment that the hydraulics have been easy to escape,\nbut any slide pool that's deep (over your head) becomes tricky to escape\nin \"high\" or higher flow. These slides behave like a \"low head dam\" with\na strong recirculating current that pulls you back to the slide,\nespecially if you are wearing backpack with any floatation in it.<br />\n<br />\n</p>\n<h3 id=\"dam_reference_photos\">Dam reference photos</h3>\n\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>The general approach profile is:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>1800 ft of elevation gain over 3.3 miles of nearly full sun\nexposure</li>\n<li>1.1 miles of flat or down hill through brush sometimes containing\nticks</li>\n<li>A steep 250 ft descent to the streambed</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"standard_approach\">Standard approach</h3>\n<p>Most groups will want to park at the three-way intersection of\nMidwick Dr, Roosevelt Ave, and Altadena Dr at 34° 11.054'N, 118°\n6.086'W. Do not follow the signs to Eaton Canyon; they direct you to the\nnature center which adds unnecessary hiking to the trip. The dirt\nparking lot on the east side of Altadena Dr is the most common place to\npark, but there is also plenty of space on the west side of the street\nand on Midwick Dr or Roosevelt Ave. The trail leading down to the wash\nbegins through an opening in the fence. Cross the wash using any of the\nmany small paths and find a very large trail running parallel to the\nwash on the other side. At this point, look back at the other side of\nthe wash and the profile that the trees make against the sky. If you\nreturn in the dark, it can be difficult to find the right place to cross\nthe wash, but the trees’ silhouettes will still be visible. Follow the\nvery large trail downstream briefly until another smaller trail branches\noff to the left into a gully. Take this trail and you should be on a\nwell-established horse trail heading up hill in less than 150 ft – the\nhorse trail is located at 34° 11.151'N, 118° 6.005'W. Follow it until it\nintersects with the Mount Wilson Toll Road at 34° 11.354'N, 118°\n5.913'W.</p>\n<p>Follow the toll road to Henninger Flats. At the entrance, a microwave\ntower is visible 2000 ft away – this is the summit of the approach. As\nthe road enters Henninger Flats, there is a shortcut on the right just\nbefore the port-o-potties. In previous years there was a water fountain\nfor visitors, however it looks like water is no longer available to the\npublic. There is a T junction at the microwave tower (34° 11.824'N, 118°\n5.182'W) – this is the highest point of the hike. Turn left to follow\nthe trail downhill. At the next fork, continue downhill to the\nright.</p>\n<p>The turn-off to the Telephone Trail (34° 11.884'N, 118° 5.415'W) is\nsometimes non-descript. It is the second partially-cleared area on the\nright side of the road, and you should find a much smaller trail heading\nin nearly the opposite direction downhill within 30 ft of the turn-off.\nFollow the Telephone Trail through a wooded area, across a stream,\nthrough a lot of brush that sometimes contains ticks, and along a steep\nhill face to a flat area on a ridge – this is Telephone Flat (34° 12'\n10.9\"N, 118° 5' 28.3\"W). The trail continues to contour along the hill\nside, and after 500 to 800 ft, there will be a steep gully with a fair\namount of scree in it. Skip that first gully and come to another\nscree-filled gully shortly after. This gully will have a tree with a\nprominent exposed root system on the downhill side of the trail. Just\nbefore that second gully is a faint use trail that is the least-steep\ndescent into the canyon, however many people descend the second scree\ngully directly, and many people appreciate or need at least a hand line\nfor the scree gully. After a 250 ft descent, you will reach the stream\nbed of Eaton Wash and the start of the canyon (34° 12' 13.96\"N, 118° 5'\n16.78\"W).</p>\n<h3 id=\"pinecrest_gate\">Pinecrest gate</h3>\n<p>There is an alternate approach that saves 170 ft of elevation gain on\nthe approach and 0.4 miles on the exit at the expense of 80 ft of\nelevation gain on the exit. <strong>As of Nov 2017 the gate has been\nremoved by the county/city, so early entry and or late exit are no\nlonger any issue</strong> <span style=\"color:red\"><strong>Because of\n2020 COVID-19 issues the gate is back and always locked</strong></span>\n<strong>As of June 2021 the gate has been removed again, so entry/exit\nis now 24/7/365</strong> <span style=\"color:green\"><strong>For 2022 the\ngate is back with timed entry from 6:00AM to 8:00PM (as best as I can\ntell); you can exit anytime</strong></span> <span style=\"color:blue\">For\nsummer 2023 someone glue the gate door latch so it's now open\n24/7.</span><br />\nOLD --&gt; The catch to this approach is that the gate is closed and\nlocked near sunset (sometimes up to an hour before sunset), which forces\neither a steep climb and private property trespass to escape the canyon,\nor an extra 1.7 miles of hiking. Teams very confident in finishing\nappreciably before sunset can save some effort by starting at this\npoint, but most teams should use the more conservative\nMidwick-Roosevelt-Altadena start.</p>\n<p>The Pinecrest gate is located at 34° 11.503'N, 118° 6.331'W. There is\nno parking on this street on the weekends, so drive around the corner to\npark on Bowring Drive. Plenty of street parking is usually available\nwithin 700 ft of the gate. Start the approach by walking through the\ngate, which is very substantial, is topped with barbed wire, and has\nmore than one video camera pointed at it. This gate is locked near\nsunset at unpredictable times. More than one group has tried to remedy\nthis but none have yet met with success. The road the gate protects is\nthe Mount Wilson toll road. As it bends to the right for the first time,\nnote the smaller gully to the left (not the major gully in front of\nyou). This is the gully you will have to climb in an emergency if the\ngate is locked when you return after the canyon. Doing so will cause you\nto trespass on private property. Continue on the toll road as it crosses\nthe bridge and continues uphill. After a while, the horse trail from the\nMidwick-Roosevelt-Altadena approach will join the toll road (34°\n11.354'N, 118° 5.913'W) and the approach instructions continue from the\nsecond paragraph.</p>\n<h3 id=\"altadena_crest_trail\">Altadena Crest Trail</h3>\n<p>As of April 2020 the Midwick and Pinecrest gates are closed full time\nand the County of Los Angeles has implemented a reservation only access\nsystem to the county controlled Eaton Canyon Natural Area and parking\nlot opening at 8am and fully closed most national holidays. The Mt.\nWilson Toll Road is not closed and unrestricted access is available via\nthe Altadena Crest Trail. The nearest trailhead is on Tanoble Drive\n(34.195548586046755, -118.11440002577537) just north of E Loma Alta\nDrive It is recommended to park on Loma Alta street and walk up to the\ntrailhead to reduce negative impacts for those neighbors now experience\nincreased trail traffic and nuisances on their street. This approach\nadds about 1.25 miles on trail with 200 feet gain and 500 feet loss on\nthe approach from the Tanoble Trailhead to the end of the trail at the\nbridge spanning Eaton Canyon Wash. The end of the Altadena Crest Trail\n(ACT) is at the foot of the driveway from the Pinecrest Gate so you have\npassed this trail if you have ever entered via Pinecrest.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<h3 id=\"water_temperature\">Water temperature</h3>\n<p>Eaton Canyon contains a large amount of water for a San Gabriel\ncanyon and therefore the equipment and preparation necessary is highly\ndependent on conditions. Between November and March, continual exposure\nto cold water makes a wet suit essentially mandatory, and a full 3mm wet\nsuit usually provides an appropriate amount of protection. In September,\nOctober, April, and May, the air temperature and a team’s cold tolerance\nwill determine whether a shorty wet suit or a full wet suit is most\nappropriate. In June, a shorty wet suit can sometimes be appropriate,\nbut some people prefer no protection. During most of July and August,\ntemperatures are hot enough for many people to go without a wet suit,\nthough some prefer a shorty. Unseasonally hot or cold days can\noccasionally alter these recommendations. There is usually a patch of\nsun just after the second rappel to warm up in.</p>\n<h3 id=\"water_challenges\">Water challenges</h3>\n<p>Most of the time, Eaton Canyon is a class B canyon requiring some\nswimming and the possibility of swimming disconnects. But occasionally,\nhigher flows can change it to a much more difficult class C canyon. Even\nmoderate flows result in a large amount of water force on the second to\nlast rappel. If there is any question as to whether Eaton may be flowing\nmore than usual, have a team member hike 30 minutes up canyon from the\nPinecrest gate to check the flow rate of the final rappel. Since the\nlast rappel is a popular day hike, you can also attempt to gauge the\nprevious day's flow from social media.</p>\n<h3 id=\"water_depth\">Water depth</h3>\n<p>The Station Fire of 2009 substantially changed the character of Eaton\nCanyon and filled in many previously-jumpable locations. Make sure to\nhave at least one team member check water depth before jumping, even if\nsome team members have experience with the canyon prior to 2011. The\nsecond to last waterfall, which people have traditionally used as a\nslide, is still fairly shallow. As of July 2020 this pool is only waist\ndeep.</p>\n<h3 id=\"rappels\">Rappels</h3>\n<p>While none of the 5-9 waterfall drops themselves are taller than\nabout 35 ft, the rappels can be up to 80 ft because some anchors are set\nback from the rappels. Most of the rappels have good natural anchors\nnearby, but may need to be re-rigged with webbing and a quick link, and\nsome anchors are in the watercourse. The final rappel has a 2-bolt\nanchor and the webbing may be missing because it is a popular location\nfor non-canyoneers to climb up to. Some rappels have single-bolt\nanchors, but more appropriate natural anchors can be found nearby.</p>\n<h3 id=\"escape_routes\">Escape routes</h3>\n<p>The technical canyon is divided into three major sections: beginning\nwater park, long beautiful creek walk amongst water polished granite\nboulders, and final technical section. Once down the first slide in the\nbeginning water park, escape is very difficult. But, there are bypass\nroutes around the second to last and last waterfalls if necessary. The\nsecond to last waterfall is characterized by a long slide that empties\ninto a long drop to a pool below. The top of the rappel usually\noverlooks a large amount of graffiti. To bypass this rappel, simply\nclimb 10 ft up RDC about 20 ft back from the drop – this should be easy\nclass 3 climbing. A prominent trail parallels the stream and then\nswitches back to end a few hundred feet downstream of the waterfall. The\nlast waterfall has a well-traveled trail that departs RDC about 200 ft\nbefore the waterfall. This bypass trail is one of the leading causes of\naccidents in Eaton Canyon and should be approached carefully. It\ninvolves very exposed class 3 climbing, and some moderate-difficult\nclass 4 moves that may or may not have the assistance of fixed hand\nlines. Attempting this trail in the dark for the first time is not\nrecommended.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>The final rappel ends at a popular hiking destination and it is\nlikely there will be a sizeable audience on summer weekends if you\nfinish before dark. Hike 0.5 miles on a popular trail until you reach a\nlarge bridge. Find the large trail LDC downstream of the bridge and\nfollow it 0.7 miles to the point at which you crossed the wash to begin\nthe trip. If it is dark, look for the tree line silhouette you observed\nbefore starting the horse trail.</p>\n<p>If you started from the Pinecrest gate, climb up to the bridge either\nRDC upstream of the bridge or LDC downstream of the bridge and hike back\nto the gate. If it is locked and it is an emergency, find the small\ngully you observed at the beginning of the trip and climb up it.\nOtherwise, go back across the bridge and take the large trail that heads\ndownhill from the bridge parallel to the wash for 0.7 miles. Cross the\nwash to find the beginning of a path (34° 11.122'N, 118° 6.125'W) that\nclimbs the steep bank to Altadena Dr. Walk north on Altadena Dr, then\nturn right on Crescent Dr, then Pinecrest Dr and you will arrive at the\nPinecrest gate 1.7 miles from the other side of the gate.</p>\n<p>In a non-emergency, the Sheriff can be called to unlock the Pinecrest\ngate if it is locked. The phone number is posted on a sign to the left\nof the big gate. Expect to wait 30 - 45 minutes.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<p>As of 6 June 2020, a <a href=\"https://www.ecnca.org/\">timed\nreservation</a> is required to enter the Los Angeles County Eaton Canyon\nNatural Area, and entry is only allowed from the visitor center. Both\nthe Pinecrest gate and Midwick-Altadena-Roosevelt entrance are closed\nwith signs and, on Saturday 20 June 2020, had people parked by them\nenforcing the closure. The timed reservations must be obtained no later\nthan the day before and can be full substantially in advance. Hiking\nfrom the visitor center adds 0.8 miles compared to the\nMidwick-Altadena-Roosevelt entrance. <strong>As of June 2021, this\nreservation system is no more</strong>, but entering from the Eaton\nCanyon Park does have hours.</p>\n<p>Most of the canyon is in the Angeles National Forest with few\nrestrictions (in normal times), but it begins and ends within Pasadena’s\nEaton Canyon Park which may, in the future, create more rules. The\nPinecrest gate is a local political issue and is currently locked before\nor near sunset, and not unlocked at a reliable time in the morning. See\nthe Altadena Crest Trail approach above for a route description that\nbypasses LA County's Eaton Canyon Natural Area entirely.</p>\n<p>Probably primarily due to the tremendous popularity of the day hike\nto the last waterfall (“first” or “the” waterfall to non-canyoneers),\nEaton Canyon is the site of a very large share of rescues and fatalities\nin the area. Multiple canyoneering groups have also been search and\nrescue targets. Because of this, many people in the area want to impose\nrestrictions on the canyon. Please avoid making this situation worse –\nyou can do this by ensuring you are well-prepared (skills and gear),\nhave an overnight bivy plan, and that anyone who might be worried about\nyou not coming back knows this plan and will not call the police first\nthing in the morning (or the previous night).</p>\n<p>There are large amounts of graffiti at the bottom section along with\nlarge amounts of trash from the locals who hike up. It helps to bring\nout 1 to 2 trash bags when visiting to help clean up the canyon.</p>\n<p>There was a permit process in place at least from 2015 on but when\napplying for a permit on Sept. 6, 2017 Dennis Merkel from the Forest\nService stated: \"The Eaton Canyon Closure Order expired and the Forest\nService did not renew it. There is no need for a permit anymore.\"</p>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<p>Chris Brennen is the father of San Gabriel canyoneering, but some of\n<a href=\"http://brennen.caltech.edu/advents/loweat.htm\">his\ndescription</a> is somewhat out of date. Also, 8 hours is a more\naggressive time estimate than most of his other canyons.
