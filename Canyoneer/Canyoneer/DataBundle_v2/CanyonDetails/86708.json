You could probably walk in to below that from a little lower down the road.\n<\/p><p>You'll find some webbing round a rock near a boulder top of 2nd. Its about 40m on left. \n<\/p><p>Straight into 3rd a series of maybe six, 5-10m cascades, we did them all on 2x60m. Not a great anchor there used a log or some small trees, it can all be scrambled on the right.\n<\/p><p>Next a few 100m very pretty creek walk with lots of small scrambles, loads of slides in this section. \n<\/p><p>Then opens up to a flat shelf with a log anchor at the top, into 4th another aprox 40m into a pool. Also very easily scrambled on the right. \n<\/p><p>5th we anchored of a tree creek left, its a nice slot again little more than 30m I think.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>From there its again a few 100m creek walk down to the Rosewood, after the next big creek on the right Newell enters, a trail on the right bank starts its getting fairly hard to find up there now, but gets clearer as you go DS.
