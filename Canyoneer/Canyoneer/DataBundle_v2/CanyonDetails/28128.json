Honestly, we would not be able to find the dirt road in the maze of sheep tracks that cross the finca (local farm), so the advice is to ask Jungla Expeditions for assistance. An off-road vehicle is required. \n<\/p><p>From the parking lot, go up a little-frequented path and reach the start of the stream in about 40 mins of steep ascent. Also in this case we recommend contacting Jungla Expeditions.\"\n<\/p><p>(translated from the cicarudeclan.com link below)\n<\/p><p>NOTE: the beta on the link from cicarudelcan (translated above) was last updated in 2005, according to the page. We attempted to locate this canyon in Mar 2021 but were not able to. The Marta reserve is now a popular park, full of developed trails, and the road to it is easily passable with a passenger vehicle. We hiked along the Rio Marta river as far as Sendero La Danta trail, which was over an hour of walking, but did not find any falls or rappels. It is possible that the canyon is actually along Rio Gato in the park. Entrance fee was $16 USD per person. Jungla Expeditions seems to be out of business. I'm attaching a photo of the map of the park below for reference.\n<\/p>\n<style data-mw-deduplicate=\"TemplateStyles:r1062633282\">@media all and (max-width:720px){.mw-parser-output .content .thumb>div:not(.thumbinner){display:flex;justify-content:center;flex-wrap:wrap;align-content:flex-start;flex-direction:column}}body.skin-vector .mw-parser-output div.thumb>div:not(.thumbinner){font-size:94%;text-align:center;overflow:hidden;min-width:100px}body.skin-minerva .mw-parser-output div.thumb>div:not(.thumbinner){margin:0 auto;max-width:100%!important}<\/style> \n<div class=\"thumb tright\">\n<div style=\"display:table;\">\n<span class=\"mw-default-size\" typeof=\"mw:Error mw:File\/Frameless\">\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Red_tape\">Red tape<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Beta_sites\">Beta sites<\/h2><\/div>\n<ul><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http:\/\/cicarudeclan.com\/ita\/a5_marta.htm\">CicaRudeClan.com<\/a> &#160;: Ca√±on de la Marta<\/li><\/ul>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Background\">Background<\/h2><\/div>\n\n\n<\/div>","id":28128,"shuttleSeconds":null,"geojson":null,"vehicle":"High Clearance","name":"Marta","waterRating":"B","rappelCountMin":7,"technicalRating":4,"timeRating":null,"version":"33277877a2a21566c7d42779e2694b722bda154cd7e2ca3da594e97522a6e066","rappelLongestMeters":40,"quality":4.5,"riskRating":null}
