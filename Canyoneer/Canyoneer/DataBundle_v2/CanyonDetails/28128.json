  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>\"From Turrialba you reach Peyibaje (about 15 km) and from here the\nreserve de la Marta. Honestly, we would not be able to find the dirt\nroad in the maze of sheep tracks that cross the finca (local farm), so\nthe advice is to ask Jungla Expeditions for assistance. An off-road\nvehicle is required.</p>\n<p>From the parking lot, go up a little-frequented path and reach the\nstart of the stream in about 40 mins of steep ascent. Also in this case\nwe recommend contacting Jungla Expeditions.\"</p>\n<p>(translated from the cicarudeclan.com link below)</p>\n<p>NOTE: the beta on the link from cicarudelcan (translated above) was\nlast updated in 2005, according to the page. We attempted to locate this\ncanyon in Mar 2021 but were not able to. The Marta reserve is now a\npopular park, full of developed trails, and the road to it is easily\npassable with a passenger vehicle. We hiked along the Rio Marta river as\nfar as Sendero La Danta trail, which was over an hour of walking, but\ndid not find any falls or rappels. It is possible that the canyon is\nactually along Rio Gato in the park. Entrance fee was $16 USD per\nperson. Jungla Expeditions seems to be out of business. I'm attaching a\nphoto of the map of the park below for reference.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><img src=\"rwl_it.png\" title=\"rwl_it.png\" alt=\"rwl_it.png\" /><a\nhref=\"http://cicarudeclan.com/ita/a5_marta.htm\">CicaRudeClan.com</a> :\nCa√±on de la Marta</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n"
