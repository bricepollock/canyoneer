  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>Race Brook Falls is a beginner friendly series of low-flow waterfalls\nand drops which can be rappelled canyoneering style. For those in New\nEngland, Race Brook Falls offers a nice taste into the sport of\ncanyoneering. Race Brook Falls isn’t a true canyon, as any rappel can be\nskipped by walking around the drop. But with three lovely rappels over\n100ft+, it's a treat tucked away in the Berkshires.</p>\n<p>Although the water is flowing, we’ve categorized this as a B because\nthe waterfalls are usually very low-flow (and can be a trickle when in\ndrought) and do not require class C techniques. Prepare for your shoes\nto get wet, but there are no swims and you do not want a wetsuit. The\nareas of rock that are wet are slippery from moss growth, and shoes with\ngood traction are recommended.</p>\n<p>Please ghost this area. Do not leave rope, webbing, or anchor\nmaterial behind. This area is used more commonly by hikers than\nrappellers, and you have no excuse to not clean your anchors as you can\nwalk back to the top of each rappel to clear them if needed.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>Park at the Race Brook Falls trailhead. This is an obvious pull off\non the trailhead side of the road (but is not a parking lot). If the\nparking area is full, unofficial parking can be found on the side of the\nroad on route 41.</p>\n<p>Follow the well marked Race Brook Fall trail towards the upper falls\nand the campsite. At ~0.5 miles, there will be a fork with the left\ngoing towards the upper falls/campsite area and the right going towards\nthe base of the lower falls. Stay left, towards the campsite; you’ll see\nthe bottom of the lower falls later. The approach to the bottom of the\nupper falls is about 1.5 miles.</p>\n<p>Once you reach the upper falls, there’s a place to off trail scramble\nto the top of the falls (scramble spot is to the left as you face the\nfalls). This is the top of the first rappel as listed here, but you can\ncontinue walking upstream to see an additional small waterfall (~20ft),\nwhich you could add as an optional rappel.</p>\n<p>As an alternative to scrambling off trail to reach the top of the\nupper falls, you can continue to follow the trail towards the campsite\nfor a longer on trail hike. After what will probably feel like one\nswitchback, you will be back at Race Brook. Leave the trail here and\nfollow the brook downstream (as of 2020, there’s a sign saying “This\narea closed to camping, use race brook falls campsite -&gt;” at the\npoint you leave the main trail) . If you hit the campsite, you have\nhiked too far and go back.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>Rappel 1 is the upper falls. There’s a tree to rig off of DCR. The\nrappel is 130ft off a ledge into a crack. For beginners, it may feel a\nlittle tricky and slippery. Expect there to be hikers at the base of the\nrappel, so make sure the area is clear if you choose to toss the\nrope.</p>\n<p>Within sight of the bottom of rappel one, you can see the short drops\nof what you can make rappels 2 and 3. Rappel 2 is 15-20ft off a large\ntree DCL. Rappel 3 is off a small tree DCL.</p>\n<p>Rappel 4 is a gradually sloping drop of 120ft. We choose to start a\nlittle high and rig off a tree DCR.</p>\n<p>Rappel 5 is the lower falls. It starts on a gradually sloping ledge\nand then turns into an easy, nice rappel of the lower falls. Rappel\nlength is about 140 ft. Expect there to be hikers at the bottom of this\nfalls, so make sure the area is clear if you are tossing the rope.</p>\n<p>You can add an additional short rappel by hiking upstream of the\nupper falls.</p>\n<p>All the wet sections of the rappels can be slippery with moss. If you\ndon’t have trail shoes or shoes with special grip, you may want to\nconsider wearing knee pads.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>After the final rappel, there are several trails that will lead you\nback to the parking area. Following the blue blazes will offer you the\nquickest, most oft-trodden path. The hike out is ~0.6 miles.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<p>None</p>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<p><strong>July 18th 2020</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Team of 4</li>\n<li>Water: low, waterfalls were a trickle</li>\n<li>Total time: 4.5 hours</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n<p>This was logged by R.
