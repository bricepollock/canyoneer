Help the Australian canyoning community by contributing\ntrack notes to ropewiki.com</p>\n<p>One of many errors in the Rick Jamieson guidebook - the grid\nreference is in the wrong creek. That error would've been perpetuated\nfrom the Dave Noble sketch map, one of very few errors by Dave. It is\npresumably an error - all of the tributaries in the area are canyons,\nbut one tributary stands out way more than the others as a quality\ncanyon, so that would've been the one named by Dave as Jumping Jacks\ncanyon. It's quite a strange error given all of the features drawn in\nthe surrounding area - the correct creek (the quality canyon) is\nobvious, but Dave must've had confusion when transferring his \"field\nnotes\" on to the sketch map.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><img src=\"rwl_en.png\" title=\"rwl_en.png\" alt=\"rwl_en.png\" /><a\nhref=\"https://youtu.be/zhmCsg9CPWY\">YouTube.com</a> : Beyond The\nGuidebook - The \"Real\" Jumping Jacks canyon</li>\n</ul>\n<p>{{#ev:youtube|zhmCsg9CPWY}}</p>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n"
