Help the Australian canyoning community by contributing track notes to ropewiki.com\n<\/p><p>One of many errors in the Rick Jamieson guidebook - the grid reference is in the wrong creek. That error would've been perpetuated from the Dave Noble sketch map, one of very few errors by Dave. It is presumably an error - all of the tributaries in the area are canyons, but one tributary stands out way more than the others as a quality canyon, so that would've been the one named by Dave as Jumping Jacks canyon. It's quite a strange error given all of the features drawn in the surrounding area - the correct creek (the quality canyon) is obvious, but Dave must've had confusion when transferring his \"field notes\" on to the sketch map.\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Red_tape\">Red tape<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Beta_sites\">Beta sites<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media<\/h2><\/div>\n<ul><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/zhmCsg9CPWY\">YouTube.com<\/a>&#160;: Beyond The Guidebook - The \"Real\" Jumping Jacks canyon<\/li><\/ul>\n<p><br \/>\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Background\">Background<\/h2><\/div>\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nParsed by mw‐api‐ext.codfw.main‐6779cc57fc‐xwjp5\nCached time: 20240914191824\nCache expiry: 2592000\nReduced expiry: false\nComplications: [show‐toc]\nCPU time usage: 0.007 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.008 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 21\/1000000\nPost‐expand include size: 0\/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 0\/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 2\/100\nExpensive parser function count: 0\/500\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0\/20\nUnstrip post‐expand size: 0\/5000000 bytes\nNumber of Wikibase entities loaded: 0\/400\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%    0.000      1 -total\n-->\n<\/div>","months":["Oct","Nov","Dec","Jan","Feb","Mar","Apr"],"url":"https:\/\/ropewiki.com\/Jumping_Jacks","id":77772,"waterRating":null,"permit":"No","technicalRating":null,"rappelCountMax":null,"rappelLongestMeters":null,"vehicle":null,"longitude":150.3119,"version":"67461e6f4c92d9b76957e0732fe844a7ef583e4b6107149f5fd5d2964258e924","name":"Jumping Jacks","latitude":-32.9478,"geojson":null}
