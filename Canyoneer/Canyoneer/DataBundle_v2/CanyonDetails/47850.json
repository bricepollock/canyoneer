Canyoning is less\nwell-known in this area, and sometimes hikers react inappropriately to\ncanyoning activities, leading to degraded relations with land managers.\nFor this reason, it may be best to descend these falls when the number\nof hikers will be low - particularly early in the morning and on\nweekdays. It is highly recommended to scrupulously follow a\nLeave-No-Trace ethic. Be aware that leaving anchors can annoy waterfall\nphotographers, irk land managers, and may encourage the inexperienced /\nunprepared to try to follow you.</p>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n",
