  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>Silver Creek is a fun canyon close to Seattle. It is a swift water\ncanyon so expect to spend a lot of time in cold water and make sure you\ncan identify water hazards.</p>\n<p>The trail parallels the creek, so the flow can be verified during the\napproach. American Whitewater has a <img src=\"rwl_en.png\"\ntitle=\"rwl_en.png\" alt=\"rwl_en.png\" /><a\nhref=\"https://www.americanwhitewater.org/content/River/detail/id/3166/#tab-flow\">vitual\ngauge</a> calculated using Skykomish river Flow. For flow above 40 cfs,\nbelays may be helpful above some of the rappels.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>The Index-Galina road was washed out in 2004 and has not reopened,\nreach the trailhead via NF-65. Follow the GPS to Skyko 3/4. This is not\nthe place. Drive downstream another 1/2 mile and cross the concrete\nbridge, follow .2 mile and take the RH Y in the road. Follow 1.1 mile\nand park before the road gets really bad. The road up to the trail head\nfrom the bridge is fairly rough and exposed in some places and not\nrecommended for low clearance vehicles. Parking by the North Fork of the\nSkykomish adds about a mile to the approach.</p>\n<p>Follow the approach trail that parallels the creek. The trail has\nbeen washed away by landsides in several locations, however as of July\n2018 is well protected with handlines. The First major of these\nlandslides serves as the canyon exit, you can also exit earlier due to\nthe trail is only 50 above the river. As you continue to follow the\ntrail, you will come across more landslides, mineshafts and old log\nbrides. Drop into the canyon at the second log bridge. There is a trail\ndown 40ft prior to the bridge with flagging.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>Walk down the creek for about a half mile. There are several small\nslides and jumps. Soon you will come across a short technical\nsections.</p>\n<p>r1: 40' off of two bolts far up on canyon right. There are options\nfor jumps mid rappel. or jump off DCL wall. Always check your depths</p>\n<p>r2: 15' off of one bolt on canyon left. There are options for jumping\nfrom canyon right, however the scramble to an appropriate ledge is\nfairly challenging and exposed. A fall here could be consequential as\nthe right side of the pool below has a 3 ft undercut. At higher flows a\nbelay to the bolt DCL may be helpful. At 40 cfs, the rappel avoids the\nmain flow.</p>\n<p>r3: 20'. This is a pretty easy jump, however one can rappel off of a\nmeat anchor. The right side of the pool below is extremely undercut and\nshould be avoided.</p>\n<p>Downstream is several fun jumps and slides. Exit dcr when a stream\ncomes in at one of the landslides.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><img src=\"rwl_en.png\" title=\"rwl_en.png\" alt=\"rwl_en.png\" /><a\nhref=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20210527212206/www.canyoneeringnorthwest.com/SilverCreek/Silver_Creek.php\">CanyoneeringNorthwest.com</a>\n: Silver Creek</li>\n<li><img src=\"rwl_en.png\" title=\"rwl_en.png\" alt=\"rwl_en.png\" /><a\nhref=\"http://ropewiki.com/User:Super_Amazing_Map?id=Silver_Creek_Canyon_-_Washington\">Super\nAmazing Map</a> : Silver Creek Canyon</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n",
