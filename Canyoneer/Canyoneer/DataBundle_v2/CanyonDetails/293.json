  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>Shenanigans is a very narrow slot canyon. You should bring the\nsmallest packs that you can and minimize your gear. There are four\nnarrows sections, that progressively get narrower. Each section takes\nabout 1 hour, except the 2nd narrows which is a bit shorter. There is\nonly one early escape exit point, which is after the end of the 3rd\nnarrows and before entering the 4th narrows. The 4th narrows is easy to\nidentify by the \"Grim Crawl\" which presents itself at the beginning of\nthis section and is a ledge on the right upon which one can crawl to\navoid rappelling a 40 foot dryfall. Since the 4th narrows are noticeably\nmore narrow, difficult, and claustrophobic than the 3rd narrows section,\nit is highly advisable to take the early exit if someone in the group\nhas any doubts. Rescue out of this type of narrows is not practical. The\nearly exit is on canyon left and is marked by a rockfall ramp. If\nnavigated correctly, it is a Class 3 climb out. Once at the top, rim\nwalk left back to the head of the canyon.</p>\n<p><strong>Warning:</strong> You should be skinny to go through this\ncanyon. If you are claustrophobic, avoid this canyon. I am 6'0 165 lbs\nand the narrows were tight. At some point in the canyon, you will feel\nthe fear creep in. We had to exhale the air from our lungs to get\nthrough some of the sections. You have to remain calm and support each\nother both mentally and physically in going through the narrows. It is\ngood to provide space between each other so that you can help with\ngetting the packs and gear through the narrows. You will not be able to\nrescue each other in the narrows. If you get stuck, it is going to be\nthe most terrifying time in your life.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>Instead of parking at the P in the above map, it is possible to drive\nanother 1.0 mile to the actual head of the canyon. The drive is down a\nless maintained dirt road, which may have some deep sand, but is\ntypically easy to go down. If driving up this sandy hill section is\nsomething you want to avoid, driving out can be done by continuing\nstraight to the next dirt road, and then making a left. From the head of\nthe canyon, at 38.06394, -110.48458, it is a 10 minute walk to the first\ndrop, which involves a 10' sheer drop off a ledge, followed by a 25' dry\nflute. To avoid a nuisance rappel off this 10' ledge, rim walk 150' on\nthe left to 38.06044, -110.48835 to an easy scramble down.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>The 25' dry flute down-climb marks the beginning of the 1st section\nof narrows. If anyone does not want to downclimb the 25' dry flute,\nthere is a convenient anchor on a small tree on the left. After about 20\nminutes there is a pool at 38.0593, -110.49023, which is usually waist\ndeep. The end of the first narrows is at 38.05666, -110.49196 where the\nwalls on either side come down to head level. It is not possible to exit\nhere. After a short walk, the 2nd narrows section is entered.</p>\n<p>The 2nd narrows is slightly more constricting than the first, and\ninvolves some stemming but can mostly be walked on the bottom. It is\nabout 1,000' long. A short walk in the open brings you to the 3rd\nnarrows section. It is slightly more constricting than the 2nd section\nand will take approximately one hour to descend. The end of the 3rd\nsection is at 38.05171, -110.49583 and is marked by a wide open wash\nwith an exit possible on the left up a rock fall crack.</p>\n<p>The 4th narrows section is the most constricting and most sustained.\nEven so, the tightest section, near the end, may only take about 15\nminutes if it is done smoothly. At the beginning of the 4th section is\nthe \"Grim Crawl\" that is a crawl on a wide ledge on the right used to\navoid a 40 foot dryfall. Often times, the most skilled downclimber will\nact as a meat anchor, letting the rest of the group rappel down the\ndryfall. Then the person that acted as the meat anchor will go across\nthe Grim Crawl and make the 40 foot downclimb. The 4th narrows can be\ndivided into two parts. The first half one can stem high and move\nefficiently through almost all of it. The second half is hard to get on\ntop of, as the walls are typically 10\" - 14\" wide and very hard to\nshimmy up. For skinny people, it is a fairly easy walk through although\nit does require going sideways most of the way. For larger frame people,\nit will require more finesse. Typically elevating a few inches or\nlowering a few inches is all it takes to find the sweet spot. A couple\nplaces may require going down onto a knee and elbow. A couple places may\nrequired elevating a few feet. Since the walls quickly reach 50' high,\nelevating all the way to the top would sap a tremendous amount of\nenergy, which is better to conserve and find a hole near the bottom. The\nend of the 4th section is obvious where the canyon widens up enough to\nstem down to a chockstone where the anchor for the final rappel is. This\nis a 45' rappel. The pool at the bottom of the rappel can be avoided by\nwalking a tiny ledge on the left and using thin cracks for finger\nholds.</p>\n<p>The bottom of the canyon, end of the technical section is at\n38.04668, -110.50125 and is barely 1.5 miles from the head. Although an\nexperienced group may do the descent in as little as 3 hours, it could\neasily take 6 hours for less experienced groups and of course, much,\nmuch longer if someone gets stuck.</p>\n<p><strong>Rappels:</strong> The number of rappels are going to be\nbetween 3-4 depending on your down climbing ability. Most of the rappels\nhave webbing, however, we used potshots as an anchor on one of the down\nclimbs. The last rappel, you will have to navigate a pool. We did not\ncarry a wet suit, however, it might be wise in cold conditions. The wet\nsuit will add gear and create more problems with navigating the narrows.\nHere is a picture of the pool (conditions can change):<br />\n<img src=\"ImageShen.jpg\" title=\"ImageShen.jpg\"\nalt=\"ImageShen.jpg\" /><br />\n(photo by Conrad Wentzel)</p>\n<p><strong>Narrows:</strong> The canyon will consist of four narrow\nsections. They will get tighter as you descend the canyon. The fourth\nwill be the tightest section with ranges of 10-12 inches.</p>\n<p>Here is a full video (15 min) of going through the fourth\nnarrows:<br />\n{{#ev:vimeo|113338297}}</p>\n<p><strong>OF NOTE - IF A RESCUE IS NEEDED</strong></p>\n<p>If one or more of your group members do need rescue, the following\nmay be helpful. If the people in the party are unable to complete the\n4th narrows they may be able to backtrack to the grim crawl. When the\nrest of the group continues through the canyons and comes back to the\nexit vehicle they can walk the canyon to 38.0514933, -110.4963178. At\nthis location a cairn anchor may be set up to drop in one member of the\nparty (100 feet) to complete the canyon up until the grim crawl. A meat\nanchor can be set up to aid the members of the party to ascend back up\nand upclimb the canyon to the drop in point. At that point, all members\ncan ascend out of the canyon and escape. It goes without saying that it\nwould be best if all members were small enough to get through so a\nrescue situation does not arise.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>Refer to the Beta sites listed below.
