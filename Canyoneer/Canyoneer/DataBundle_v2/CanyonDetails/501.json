class=\"mw-content-ltr mw-parser-output\" lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><p>It is very short but will give you a nice taste of another area of Arches National Park. There are some impressive views of enormous sandstone walls and a unique tunnel on the approach. If you have done all of the other canyons in the Park, this is a fine 1\/2 day. Great for beginners.\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Be sure to go through the Tunnel, a unique natural feature that is easily reached. A partner assist may be required on the exit side of the tunnel for beginners.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>The rappel off the tree at the head of the canyon is unnecessary. It is an easy down-climb to the bolted anchor 100 feet below. There are a couple spots where a first-timer may need an assist. By laying on one's back and splaying one's legs out a slide can be completely avoided. If one does slide it is a 2 foot slide. Someone assisting from below can reach up and touch the first-timers feet to stop a slide. \n<\/p><p>The first rappel is anchored from a jug handle on canyon left and is an 80-foot rappel. It can also be down-climbed but it has one spicy spot involving a short drop off a ledge.\n<\/p><p>The second rappel is mandatory as it is a 40 foot free-hang.\n<\/p><p>For the third and final rappel, the boulder anchor that is 100 feet from the lip is not recommended. If you do not heed this advice and choose to rappel from this anchor, be prepared for a horrendous rope pull and associated damage to your rope. It is a very easy down-climb to the big shelf before the final drop. Once on the big shelf, walk left for about 300 feet to a square boulder that serves as an anchor for a 40 foot rappel with a short free-hang. This can also be down-climbed slightly further left.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Hike down the drainage for about 10 minutes to the road, then right for about 1 mile.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Red_Tape\">Red Tape<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading3\"><h3 id=\"Permits\">Permits<\/h3><\/div>\n<p>A permit is required for any and all canyoneering within the boundaries of Arches National Park.
