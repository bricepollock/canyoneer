This route ascends an easy 5th class climbing route\nbelieved to be the oldest First Ascent in the Sedona area (1930's). Ruin\ncites are visible on the lower ledges, and the views from the summit are\namong the best in the area.</p>\n<p>The highlight of this route is the large wine glass shaped alcove on\nthe South Eastern face.</p>\n<p>Tag the summit and sign the register, before heading back to the\nanchors and starting the garden traverse.</p>\n<p>The rappel out of the Alcove ranks with the best 200's in the Sedona\narea.</p>\n<p>Time rating varies depending on if you tag this epic summit which is\nhighly reccomended.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>Elevation includes summit scramble.</p>\n<p>Download KML.</p>\n<p>Take courthouse loop trail to courthouse butte as there are a variety\nof ways to get there. Once on the trail head toward the carved out\nSouthern face of Courthouse butte.</p>\n<p>Follow kml track and faint social trail up gully, across ledges, and\nto the base of the mini arete feature just left of the black cave. Soak\nup some shade in the black cave, and get ready, your adventure starts\nhere!</p>\n<p>Just 50 yards past the start of the climb is a small ruin set. this\nis less than a 5 minute detour and worth checking out. Please Do Not\ntouch, lean, or stand on artifacts.</p>\n<p>Start the scramble up the first crux, about 45 feet of easy 4th class\nup a small ramp just left of the black cave.. There is a bolt at the top\nof this scramble that could be used to belay or haul gear.</p>\n<p>Work your way up and further into the bowl up canyon. Follow the\nobvious social trail into the bowl and up to where you traverse to the\nlast 5th class section. This section can be protected with 1 #1 cam and\n2 quick draws. The crux of the whole climb is 2 mantle moves past 2\nbolts to bomber anchors.</p>\n<p><a\nhref=\"https://www.mountainproject.com/route/105812335/central-south-rib\">https://www.mountainproject.com/route/105812335/central-south-rib</a></p>\n<p>As of 3/29/2021: There has been new blue climbing grade handline\nfixed to the anchors.</p>\n<p>From anchors scramble up easy 15' chimney and head to turn off close\nto garden traverse. Leave packs at turn off if you decide to scramble to\nthe summit. True summit is up right/east, has some cool mini caves, and\nthe summit log in a tin in the rock stack. The views here are\nphenomenal. Snack up and head back down to your packs.</p>\n<p>After tagging the summit start the garden traverse across the\nvegetation band staying high. Tip toe through the garden as all\nvegetation is very fragile and untouched.</p>\n<p>Please be mindful of the preservation of this area, and possible\nhikers below. Try to maintain minimal impact on the terrain, and call\nout any rope tosses or rock fall.</p>\n<p>We ask that you do not touch, stand, or lean on any ruin walls. This\nincludes photos of canyoneers leaning on the walls to pose for photos.\nThis is highly frowned upon.</p>\n<p>Work your way to R1 and enjoy!</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>Traverse the garden ledge to r1.</p>\n<p>R1. 105' into alcove off tree. Take crack ldc to slickrock.</p>\n<p>R2. 220' 2 stage past first ledge to the bottom.</p>\n<p>Rock quality after r2 is poor of you head left down canyon to bypass\nthe next 2 short drops. It could be advantageous to head right down\ncanyon about 75 yards after r2 and either fiddle stick both small drops,\nor set an anchor at the top of the first drop. This appears to be on the\nwatercourse and has better rock quality.</p>\n<p>Soon you will face a steep drop with no anchor option and the trail\nin view. Cut up and right down canyon and around corner, then stem off\ntree to downclimb to next ledge.</p>\n<p>Next you can either hug the rock face staying high right and exit\nhere, or do one last optional 110' rappel down a chute and into the\ncrack.</p>\n<p>After r2 Exit rdc.</p>\n<p>There are two more optional rappels after r2.</p>\n<p>r3. off pitons over black cave. 50'</p>\n<p>r4. after r3. on left off bush. 105'.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>After r2 there are many ways down, but they are in the direction you\ncame.</p>\n<p>r3. piton rapp can be downclimbed, the way you came up but is a fun\nshort rappel.</p>\n<p>r4. can be bypassed to reconnect with approach trail.</p>\n<p>connect with main trail.</p>\n<p>Head back the way you came. Leave no trace.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<p>Purchase a red rock pass at trailhead.</p>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<p><a\nhref=\"https://www.mountainproject.com/route/105812335/central-south-rib\">https://www.mountainproject.com/route/105812335/central-south-rib</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n<p>First Descent Eric Moorcroft &amp; Forest Burke 3/29/2021</p>\n<p><a\nhref=\"https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=10101788668705752&amp;id=38100945\">https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=10101788668705752&amp;id=38100945</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background_1\">Background</h2>\n",
