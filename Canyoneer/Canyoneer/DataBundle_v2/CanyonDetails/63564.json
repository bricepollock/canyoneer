Several other short drops can be bypassed or downclimbed.  Mid-way through the canyon is a rappel that requires a sand trap and creative problem solving skills for the rope pull. It is advisable to bring a 150ft or longer pull rope for pulling the sand trap.  Please use techniques to minimize rope grooves when pulling the sand trap down.  It might be possible to break this rappel up into two, which may be a better option for reducing rope grooves...\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>A short walk with a little bit of easy scrambling down lower Casablanca Canyon will return you to your car.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Red_tape\">Red tape<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Beta_sites\">Beta sites<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Background\">Background<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Dave Pimental, who explored many of the short slots around Hog Springs, including Morocco, Hogwarts, and Merry Piglet, referred to this canyon as Casablanca Canyon.

The short technical south fork of Casablanca Canyon is named after the famous, though misquoted, line from the movie Casablanca; a playful name for a playful canyon.\n<\/p><p>See also: <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external free\" href=\"http:\/\/ropewiki.com\/Casablanca_Canyon_(North_Fork)\">http:\/\/ropewiki.com\/Casablanca_Canyon_(North_Fork)<\/a>\n<\/p>\n\n\n<\/div>","version":"462a5b62faab9a5ca25f3d1c4c41cec0decd56ec35328282b6d1951e933b9b7f","vehicle":"Passenger","url":"https:\/\/ropewiki.com\/Casablanca_Canyon_(South_Fork)","rappelCountMax":4,"geojson":null}
