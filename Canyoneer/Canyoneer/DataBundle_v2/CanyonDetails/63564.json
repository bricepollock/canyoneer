  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>A very short canyon with great views and a few challenges.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>From the Casablanca canyon parking area walk up the canyon until you\nencounter a gully on the south (37.982024, -110.481763). Climb the gully\nnearly to the top, where a wider ledge layer can be followed around to\nthe top of the canyon at 37.982024, -110.481763.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>The entry drop can be downclimbed, but some groups may want to set up\na rappel. Several other short drops can be bypassed or downclimbed.\nMid-way through the canyon is a rappel that requires a sand trap and\ncreative problem solving skills for the rope pull. It is advisable to\nbring a 150ft or longer pull rope for pulling the sand trap. Please use\ntechniques to minimize rope grooves when pulling the sand trap down. It\nmight be possible to break this rappel up into two, which may be a\nbetter option for reducing rope grooves...</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>A short walk with a little bit of easy scrambling down lower\nCasablanca Canyon will return you to your car.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n<p>Dave Pimental, who explored many of the short slots around Hog\nSprings, including Morocco, Hogwarts, and Merry Piglet, referred to this\ncanyon as Casablanca Canyon. The minislot Guide for Morocco Canyon shows\nthis canyon as \"Casablanca\" <a\nhref=\"http://www.math.utah.edu/~sfolias/minislot/canyons/?i=morocco\">http://www.math.utah.edu/~sfolias/minislot/canyons/?i=morocco</a>.\nSee also: <a\nhref=\"http://www.math.utah.edu/~sfolias/canyontales/canyonames/#nwt\">http://www.math.utah.edu/~sfolias/canyontales/canyonames/#nwt</a>.</p>\n<p>The bottom of Casablanca Canyon affords a short scenic walk with some\nminor scrambling. The lower canyon ends with views of alcoves and a dry\nfall.</p>\n<p>\"Play it Again Sam\" is the fork that ends in a rappel above a hanging\ngarden on the south side of the dead end (right side looking up canyon).\nThe short technical south fork of Casablanca Canyon is named after the\nfamous, though misquoted, line from the movie Casablanca; a playful name\nfor a playful canyon.</p>\n<p>See also: <a\nhref=\"http://ropewiki.com/Casablanca_Canyon_(North_Fork)\">http://ropewiki.com/Casablanca_Canyon_(North_Fork)</a></p>\n"
