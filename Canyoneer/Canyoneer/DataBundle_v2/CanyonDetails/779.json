Hike the river south a short distance to exit up Cathedral Wash.\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Walk along the road until you come to the obvious wash on the right. Short and easy.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>There are several natural arches on a shelf just below the dryfall. At the time of writing none of them are rigged with webbing. Use a sling on one of them to tether yourself since there is quite a bit of exposure rigging this rappel. The largest of the arches is a good place to set up a retrievable anchor and you can use one of the others as a backup.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Boulder hop and scramble down river until you find the fisherman's trail. Take it to the mouth of Cathedral Wash and begin the exit hike up. Several cairns that will lead the way. Take time to enjoy the exit. It is beautiful. There will likely be some water, but the ledge system should enable you to stay dry. If you're not shuttling and you parked at the 2.8 Mile Wash trailhead, you can take the side canyon up to the road circa 36.83558,-111.63208 to save yourself some walking.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Red_tape\">Red tape<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Beta_sites\">Beta sites<\/h2><\/div>\n<ul><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http:\/\/ropewiki.com\/User:Super_Amazing_Map?id=2.8-Mile_Wash_-_Grand_Canyon\">Super Amazing Map<\/a> &#160;: 2.8-Mile Wash<\/li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http:\/\/ropewiki.com\/User:Grand_Canyoneering_Book?id=2.8-Mile_Wash\">Grand Canyoneering Book by Todd Martin<\/a> &#160;: 2.8-Mile Wash<\/li><\/ul>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media<\/h2><\/div>\n<ul><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external free\" href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/pat.winstanley.7\/media_set?set=a.509286222463413.1073741832.100001461198708&amp;type=3\">https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/pat.winstanley.7\/media_set?set=a.509286222463413.1073741832.100001461198708&amp;type=3<\/a><\/li><\/ul>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Background\">Background<\/h2><\/div>\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nParsed by mw‐api‐ext.codfw.main‐6779cc57fc‐ckm4f\nCached time: 20240914191823\nCache expiry: 2592000\nReduced expiry: false\nComplications: [show‐toc]\nCPU time usage: 0.007 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.008 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 21\/1000000\nPost‐expand include size: 0\/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 0\/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 2\/100\nExpensive parser function count: 0\/500\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0\/20\nUnstrip post‐expand size: 0\/5000000 bytes\nNumber of Wikibase entities loaded: 0\/400\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%    0.000      1 -total\n-->\n<\/div>","shuttleSeconds":null,"vehicle":"Passenger","quality":2.5,"permit":"No","waterRating":"A","riskRating":null,"timeRating":"I","latitude":36.8442,"url":"https:\/\/ropewiki.com\/2.8-Mile_Wash","rappelCountMin":1,"longitude":-111.6189,"version":"0582f9a2b464a0f02424baed3f8bb29ed4bbe9660686eaa3c929f14a68ae9ce4","geojson":null}
