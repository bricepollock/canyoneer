  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>A short canyon route in the Marble Canyon area of the Grand Canyon\nwith one big rappel of 160 feet that takes you to the Colorado River.\nHike the river south a short distance to exit up Cathedral Wash.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>Walk along the road until you come to the obvious wash on the right.\nShort and easy.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>There are several natural arches on a shelf just below the dryfall.\nAt the time of writing none of them are rigged with webbing. Use a sling\non one of them to tether yourself since there is quite a bit of exposure\nrigging this rappel. The largest of the arches is a good place to set up\na retrievable anchor and you can use one of the others as a backup.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>Boulder hop and scramble down river until you find the fisherman's\ntrail. Take it to the mouth of Cathedral Wash and begin the exit hike\nup. Several cairns that will lead the way. Take time to enjoy the exit.\nIt is beautiful. There will likely be some water, but the ledge system\nshould enable you to stay dry. If you're not shuttling and you parked at\nthe 2.8 Mile Wash trailhead, you can take the side canyon up to the road\ncirca 36.83558,-111.63208 to save yourself some walking.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><img src=\"rwl_en.png\" title=\"rwl_en.png\" alt=\"rwl_en.png\" /><a\nhref=\"http://ropewiki.com/User:Super_Amazing_Map?id=2.8-Mile_Wash_-_Grand_Canyon\">Super\nAmazing Map</a> : 2.8-Mile Wash</li>\n<li><img src=\"book.png\" title=\"book.png\" alt=\"book.png\" /><a\nhref=\"http://ropewiki.com/User:Grand_Canyoneering_Book?id=2.8-Mile_Wash\">Grand\nCanyoneering Book by Todd Martin</a> : 2.8-Mile Wash</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<p>{{#ev:youtube|TCLGa2eCfVU}}</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a\nhref=\"https://www.facebook.com/pat.winstanley.7/media_set?set=a.509286222463413.1073741832.100001461198708&amp;type=3\">https://www.facebook.com/pat.winstanley.7/media_set?set=a.509286222463413.1073741832.100001461198708&amp;type=3</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n"
