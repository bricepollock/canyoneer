Permits are obtained through Recreation.gov (see Red Tape section below).  Access is by driving up to I-70 and exiting Yellow Cat and passing through Yellow Cat Mesa.\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Getting_There\">Getting There<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Drive 19 mile on dirt road that has sand and a bumpy clearance section at the end. There are stories of cars getting stuck.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>From the parking area at the fence line, follow the remains of an old 4x4 trail running due north and paralleling the fence.  At the point the track fades out take the first drainage northwest untill in encounters the main Lost and Found drainage running westward.  Once in the main L&amp;F drainage follow it until you encounter the first rappel.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Fun with some tight narrow sections, a tight section to crawl under. A few multi-stage raps.\n<\/p><p>All three rappels are bolted with two glue-in bolts.  The final anchor has sepparated chains.  The chains are intentionally not connected so as to prevent a log from potentially getting caught in the chains during a flash flood and ripping out the bolts.  If you are new to this type of anchor just treat it the same way you would any other anchor with a single quick link--only now there are two \"quicklinks\" as the final link in each chain is effectively a quicklink.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading3\"><h3 id=\"Climber's_Exit\"><span id=\"Climber.27s_Exit\"><\/span>Climber's Exit<\/h3><\/div>\n<p>The standard exit is up the official NPS-established \"Climbers Exit\" to the Covert Arch trail. Follow the Lost and Found drainage until it opens up untill you reach a junction with a canyon coming in on the south.  Turn south and keep a lookout for a small foot path on the west that can be difficult to spot. There may or may not be a small NPS sign at the path way.  \n<\/p><p>Once you find the start of the Climbers' Exit proceed up the path staying on the slickrock.  The exit slab climb is a class 3, class 4 scramble with some exposure.  Not recommended when wet or snow covered as it would be hazardous if not impossible to exit under those conditions. If using the climbing route up the slab, there will be a use trail along the rim back to the car. Look for rocks and park signs for the use trail to avoid stepping on the cryptobiotic soil and vegetation.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading3\"><h3 id=\"Hiker's_Exit\"><span id=\"Hiker.27s_Exit\"><\/span>Hiker's Exit<\/h3><\/div>\n<p>Alternatively the canyon can be exited via the Hiker's Exit to the Lost Spring Hiker's Exit Trailhead.  This is also known as the Long, or Winter Exit as it is the route required to exit if ice, snow, or water is present on the Climber's Exit.  This exit option will require setting up a car shuttle in advance, however.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Red_Tape\">Red Tape<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading3\"><h3 id=\"Permits\">Permits<\/h3><\/div>\n<p>A permit is required for any and all canyoneering within the boundaries of Arches National Park.

A separate permit is required for each canyoneering route.\n<\/p><p>Permits must be obtained online through the link below and are available online 8:00AM MT one day in advance up to 5:00PM MT the day of the trip.
