  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>Easy canyon with easy access. There is one decent slide and jump\ninside. The nice thing about this canyon is that you're allowed in\n(whilst access to the superior canyons in Mureung Valley [same mountain]\nis prohibited)</p>\n<p>There is one road into this valley. Park at the large recreational\narea and walk the last 5 minutes of road. When the road makes its last\nfork, head right, past the private property. Trail into the canyon is\ngained by going through the gate.</p>\n<p>Canyon is unbolted.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n",
