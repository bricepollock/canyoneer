The one referenced in the uploaded KML file seemed\nthe cleanest and involves minimal effort to access.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<p>Gaia seems to indicate blocks of potentially private land existing\nnearby, though the KML track and section of drainage identified on this\npage are located on BLM land.</p>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<p>Kaiser Hot Springs: <a\nhref=\"https://www.americansouthwest.net/arizona/kaiser_spring/canyon.html\">https://www.americansouthwest.net/arizona/kaiser_spring/canyon.html</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n<p>Explored and shared September 2022.</p>\n",
