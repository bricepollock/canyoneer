The story was recounted by Rick's friend Joe Dunn in an interview with Gabriela Faura in Jan 2020:\n<i>Joe recalls vividly that night. “We were looking for Devil’s Pinch Canyon and we had camped for the night in an area full of wombat holes. I took my volleys off and placed my false teeth inside. During the night I felt a wombat walking over me and I threw my shoes at it with my teeth, which I never found again!”<\/i>\n<\/p>\n\n\n<\/div>","rappelLongestMeters":null,"version":"a646d6e22a900c13b2e8c1201f3ba6ea930799249af683f4ea2cb296d6b5ec9f"}
