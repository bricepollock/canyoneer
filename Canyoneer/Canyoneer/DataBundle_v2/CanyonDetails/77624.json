The story was recounted by Rick's friend Joe Dunn in an interview with Gabriela Faura in Jan 2020:\n<i>Joe recalls vividly that night. “We were looking for Devil’s Pinch Canyon and we had camped for the night in an area full of wombat holes. I took my volleys off and placed my false teeth inside. During the night I felt a wombat walking over me and I threw my shoes at it with my teeth, which I never found again!”<\/i>\n<\/p>\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nParsed by mw‐api‐ext.codfw.main‐6779cc57fc‐x97mn\nCached time: 20240914191909\nCache expiry: 2592000\nReduced expiry: false\nComplications: [show‐toc]\nCPU time usage: 0.007 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.007 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 21\/1000000\nPost‐expand include size: 0\/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 0\/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 2\/100\nExpensive parser function count: 0\/500\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0\/20\nUnstrip post‐expand size: 0\/5000000 bytes\nNumber of Wikibase entities loaded: 0\/400\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%    0.000      1 -total\n-->\n<\/div>","timeRating":null,"longitude":150.2957,"rappelCountMax":null}
