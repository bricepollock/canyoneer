Source unknown.</p>\n<p>The name \"False Teeth Canyon\" was given by guidebook author Rick\nJamieson. The story was recounted by Rick's friend Joe Dunn in an\ninterview with Gabriela Faura in Jan 2020: <em>Joe recalls vividly that\nnight. “We were looking for Devil’s Pinch Canyon and we had camped for\nthe night in an area full of wombat holes. I took my volleys off and\nplaced my false teeth inside. During the night I felt a wombat walking\nover me and I threw my shoes at it with my teeth, which I never found\nagain!”</em></p>\n"
