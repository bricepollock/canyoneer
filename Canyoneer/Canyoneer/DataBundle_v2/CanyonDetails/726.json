This routed requires a car shuttle or hitch hiking.  Alternatively, there is a in-river hiking option from the visitor center to the lower waterfall.  Howerver, this alternative route option will not be covered in this description.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading3\"><h3 id=\"Parking\">Parking<\/h3><\/div>\n<p>It is recommended to start the hike from the Sulphur Creek Trailhead.  This is a parking area\/trailhead off of Highway 24 not too far from the Chimney Rock Trailhead.  (It is recommended to use this trailhead\/parking area instead of the Chimney Rock Trailhead.) \n<\/p><p>If doing this route as a car shuttle, please park your recovery vehilce in the dirt parking area across from the visitor center on the north side of highway 24 next the the bridge over Sulphur Creek.  The Park asks people to please leave shuttle vehicles here rather than in the visitor center parking lot as the visitor center parking lot fills up.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading3\"><h3 id=\"Hitch_Hiking\">Hitch Hiking<\/h3><\/div>\n<p>If hitch hiking it is best to catch a ride from the visitor center to the Sulphur Creek Trailhead BEFORE your hike as it is generally easier to hitch hike earlier in the day and when you are also drier and cleaner.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>From the Sulphur Creek Trailhead Parking area there is a dirt trail leading down an embankment to to a dry wash that meanders mostly due south.  Hiking in the wash is the easiest and most straight forward route.  Follow it until the wash intersects Sulphur Creek.  \n<\/p><p>Once Sulphur Creek is reached you will be hiking in water for the rest of the hike--so expect to get your feet wet.  Depending on flow, water level, and changes in siltation it is possible to get wet up to the knees, waist, or higher; however, swim-deep water is rare and will only occur if sections are scoured.  Water quality in the river varies.  At times Sulphur Creek runs clean and clear and other times it is chocolate brown and silty.  The riverbed can be rocky or silty but walking through the riverbed should not be difficult; however when silty you will not be able to see where you are placing your feet so a little extra care may be needed at times.  (This route is frequently done as a family outing with children so nothing is going to be too challenging.)\n<\/p><p>Halfway down Sulphur Creek you will encounter the first two water falls.  Both of these falls can be bypassed on the down-canyon-right via some easy 3rd-class scrambling.  Small children may need help or supervision through these sections but they are not overly difficult.  There is a little fall exposure but it is quite low.  After these waterfalls the route narrows up for a short bit and this section is where deeper water or really silty river bottoms may be encountered at times.  The narrow section is very pretty but it doesn't last all that long so enjoy it while it does.  \n<\/p><p>The lower waterfall is the last obstacle in Sulphur Creek.  It is generally navigated by sliding down the water slide (in the water flow).  Do note that there is, as of this writing, a rock under water at the bottom so be careful where you land.  Generally try to land down-canyon-left as much as possible to avoid the submerged rock.  Alternatively, depending on water\/flow level, it is possible to down climb this obstacle (instead of doing the water slide) on the down-canyon-right but it is slippery and almost all will want\/require partner assist to do so without slipping and falling.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>After navigating the lower waterfall it is a short hike back to the visitor center. The hike can be finish in-river the whole way back to the visitor center, or you can pop out of the river when the Lime Kiln trail is encountered down-canyon-left and hike back part way on a dry, sandy\/dirt trail that passes by the historic Lime Kilns.\n<\/p><p>If finishing the hike the whole way in-river, be mindful of the remnants of an old diversion dam in the very last bend right that is in sight of the visitor center and maintence buildings.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Red_tape\">Red tape<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Permits are not required to hike Sulphur
