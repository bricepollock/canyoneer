Camping and other accommodation options are available at Wombeyan Caves campground but must be pre-booked through NPWS\n<\/p><p>Maps can be obtained from the Kiosk.\nRope: 8m handline handy to ascend small waterfall at the top of the canyon at a popular jump spot\nWetsuit: Not required in summer months\nLilo: This canyon contains long swims so lilo or flotation recommended for poor swimmers\nWalk-in: 30-45min with a visit to the tinted cave\nWalkout: 30-40min\nDescent: &lt;2 hours though most people will spend more time chilling out in the canyon\nRating 2.5\/4\nV1A2__\nElevation Gain: 200m\nDistance 7Km\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Entry: From the car park, cross the pedestrian bridge and follow the Mares Forest Creek track up the hill. Stay straight at the 3-way intersection at the top of the hill and follow the track along and down to the Tinted Cave. This is open to explore and give a nice view over the end of the canyon(head torch handy but switch operated lights on a timer are available in the cave).\nGo past the entrance for the cave, down the stairs to meet the creek at the bottom of the canyon.\nFollow the canyon upstream\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Just make your way up to the pool where the gorge begins to open out and then return\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Reverse your trip in\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Red_tape\">Red tape<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Check the NP page for updates on road closures\n<\/p><p><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external free\" href=\"https:\/\/www.nationalparks.nsw.gov.au\/visit-a-park\/parks\/wombeyan-karst-conservation-reserve\">https:\/\/www.nationalparks.nsw.gov.au\/visit-a-park\/parks\/wombeyan-karst-conservation-reserve<\/a>\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Beta_sites\">Beta sites<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media<\/h2><\/div>\n<p><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external free\" href=\"https:\/\/sleepwhenwearedead.net\/2019\/01\/02\/mares-forest-creek-for-nyd\/\">https:\/\/sleepwhenwearedead.net\/2019\/01\/02\/mares-forest-creek-for-nyd\/<\/a>\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Background\">Background<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Mares Forest creek canyon is located in the Wombeyan Karst conservation reserve.\nWombeyan Caves are located on the traditional lands of the Burra Burra clan of the Gandangara people in the area covered by the Pejar Local Aboriginal Land Council.
