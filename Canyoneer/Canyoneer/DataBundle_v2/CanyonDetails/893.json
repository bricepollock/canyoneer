While the section of canyon described here is not technical, it's worth a visit in its own right just for the bizarre scenery.  See below for options to make this a longer outing. Watch for owls and small animal bones.\n<\/p>\n<ul><li>Warning:  apparently this canyon can be subject to periodic water releases from an upstream dam at certain times of the year.  Being in the narrows would be extremely bad in high flow. Some sites suggest if there is any water in the canyon, do not go. Generally, it becomes accessible in July and August and remains so through the winter.<\/li><\/ul>\n<ul><li>One site notes that rattlesnakes are encountered here frequently.<\/li><\/ul>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading3\"><h3 id=\"Driving\">Driving<\/h3><\/div>\n<p>The parking area is about 30min north of Shoshone.
