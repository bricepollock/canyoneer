{"shuttleSeconds":null,"months":["Jun","Jul","Aug","Sep","Oct"],"description":"<div class=\"mw-content-ltr mw-parser-output\" lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><p>Rolling Mountain Creek (RMC) is a tributary to Upper Cascade Creek, north of Durango.  This canyon descent provides spectacular views, interesting features, challenging geometry for the rappels, loose rock and a great alternate entrance to Upper Cascade Creek proper or can be done within a day without a car shuttle.\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>From the Durango Mountain Resort, drive FS Road 578 (=Hermosa Park Rd) out of the parking lots to the north and continue as it switchbacks to the west. At the intersection with Elbert Creek Rd, turn north (right) continuing on FS578. Shortly, Hermosa Park Rd turns west, remain straight on FS38. Turn right on FS579 (=Cascade Divide Road, =FS37). Follow this either to the end or drop a car at the top of the Greysill Trail for your return.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nHC 4WD will have no problems. HC 2WD can likely get through - nothing is too rough. A Subaru AWD made it with care. To get an earlier start, consider camping along this road the night before.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nFrom the upper parking lot, hike the connector trail to the Colorado Trail and continue north 2.5 easy miles to the bridge over Cascade Creek.  Views of Rolling Mountain Creek will be possible from the trail on the East side of the Cascade Creek valley.\n<style data-mw-deduplicate=\"TemplateStyles:r1062633282\">@media all and (max-width:720px){.mw-parser-output .content .thumb>div:not(.thumbinner){display:flex;justify-content:center;flex-wrap:wrap;align-content:flex-start;flex-direction:column}}body.skin-vector .mw-parser-output div.thumb>div:not(.thumbinner){font-size:94%;text-align:center;overflow:hidden;min-width:100px}body.skin-minerva .mw-parser-output div.thumb>div:not(.thumbinner){margin:0 auto;max-width:100%!important}<\/style> \n<\/p>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\">\n<div style=\"display:table;\">\n<span class=\"mw-default-size\" typeof=\"mw:Error mw:File\/Frameless\">\n<\/div>\n<\/div><p><br \/>\n<\/p><p>Continue past the bridge on the Colorado Trail Segment 25 toward the saddle on the SE side of Rolling Mountain.
