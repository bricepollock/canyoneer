  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>The Tesseract is a narrow and committing box canyon and gorge on an\nunnamed creek / faultline draining a small basin on the northwestern\nside of the Enigma Range (Mt Garfield Massif). The route begins with a\n300’ waterfall dropping into a narrow box canyon just above 2350' in\nelevation. Below the box canyon the creek has a less steep pitch, but\nmaintains a series of scenic bedrock cascades and pools down to the\nriver bottom. While it can be difficult to navigate, there is an easy\nwalk in after a somewhat exposed steep scramble near the top.</p>\n<p>Water flow in this canyon generally runs low due to its small\ncatchment size. Mid winter flow during cold and clear conditions is\nroughly comparable to the late spring/early summer melt stages, with\npeak flow likely during snowmelt in April. That combined with a low\nelevation approach makes access possible nearly year round depending on\nthe local conditions.</p>\n<p>The first sequence in this canyon is a technical multi-pitch rappel.\nGroups should have good rope management skills, and know how to rig a\nretrievable traverse line. It is recommended to bring enough rope to rig\nthe first two pitches simultaneously. Damaging or getting a rope stuck\non the first multi-pitch sequence could result in becoming trapped in\nthe canyon, or worse, on the ledge in between the first two pitches.\nAbrasion minimization techniques are a must due the very sharp rock.</p>\n<h4 id=\"avalanche_warning\">Avalanche Warning</h4>\n<p>Tesseract is also prone to winter avalanches, filling up the box\ncanyon with deep snow that can take well into the summer season to melt\nout. These avalanches do not happen every season, and may vary in the\nvolume of snow deposited in the canyon. The creek flows under this snow\nand creates snow bridges, which become more unstable and creates risk of\ncollapse as the snow melts. Attempting the canyon with significant snow\nis highly discouraged. Groups should be aware of the risk of avalanche\ndebris, especially if the first group of the season when conditions are\nunknown. In mid-spring avalanche debris have been observed down to 1800'\nin the core of the narrow box section.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>A small parking area is available at the gate to the bridge/old road\nthat is the Taylor River Trailhead (parking option 1). If this area is\nfull, you may have to park a few hundred yards back down the road\n(parking option 2). A pit toilet is available at the latter parking area\n<em>(as of September 2020, this toilet is closed due to\nCovid-19)</em>.</p>\n<p>From the Taylor River trailhead, take a faint fishermans track just\npast the gate on the right. Work your way along the riverbank until you\ncross the Tesseract drainage. The fisherman's track itself disappears a\nshort way in, and some bushwhacking is involved. Once the fisherman's\ntrail peters out, drop down close to the river as soon as it's\nreasonable to do so. Travel is much easier closer to the river, rather\nthan staying high. This route could use some maintenance at some\npoint.</p>\n<p>Alternatively to save time, when the Taylor River is low (usually\nlate July through the end of summer), cross the bridge and take an easy\nwalk about 500 yards down the trail, then cross the river. Do the same\nat the end of the day.</p>\n<p>Cross the Tesseract creekbed. Heading up the hill on the north bank,\nthe understory is generally open, with occasional thick patches of salal\nand vine maple. You will gain about 1,200' of elevation on the approach,\nand certain sections are quite steep. Starting in the late 1920's on up\nthrough the 1970's the Taylor Valley was logged, so most of the uphill\napproach here is in second growth timber. Along the river, there is a\ncautious mix of thorny salmonberry and devils club, with a friendly\nscattering of trillium, bleeding heart, and other floral/mossy carpets.\nAvoid getting too close the edge of the canyon on the hike up where you\nmay get cliffed out. The brush gets noticeably thicker towards the top\nof the approach.</p>\n<p>At around 2250' elevation you will reach the base of a large\ncliffband. Traverse the bottom of the cliffband towards the canyon.\nYou'll soon scramble up onto a broad rocky platform at the top of the\nfalls that affords access directly into the Tesseract.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>DCR = Down Canyon Right</p>\n<p>DCL = Down Canyon Left</p>\n<p>The canyon starts off with a multi-pitch rappel into the heart of the\ncanyon. This particular section of canyon is prone to rockfall as well\nas avalanches in the winter months. It is possible existing anchors\ncould become damaged. An emergency bolt kit is highly recommended,\nparticularly for the first group of the season. Natural anchor options\nhere are very limited/non-existent.</p>\n<p><strong>Multipitch Rappel Sequence</strong></p>\n<p><strong>R1</strong>: 185’ from bolts DCL to a narrow ledge DCL. At\nthe bottom of R1, transition and rig a retrievable traverse line from\ntwo unlinked bolts to the bolted anchor for R2. <strong>Do not leave a\nfixed line here!</strong> The distance from the traverse line bolts to\nthe R2 bolts is about 25', so a retrievable line at least 50' long is\nnecessary.</p>\n<p><strong>R2</strong>: 150' from bolts DCL. <strong>Be aware that the\nrock here is very sharp.</strong> Abrasion minimization techniques are a\nmust. This rappel will take you into the heart of the canyon. Enjoy the\nspectacular view from the ledge here.</p>\n<p><strong><em>(End Multipitch)</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong>R3</strong>: 150’ from bolts on either DCR or DCL into a\nnarrow channel. The anchor on canyon right is more easily accessible and\navoids the flow better than the anchor on canyon left. Much of this\nrappel is free hanging.</p>\n<p><em>The middle section of the canyon is choked with loose boulders\nand a maelstrom of log debris. Most can be bypassed but there are some\nnuisance rappels.</em></p>\n<p><strong>R4</strong>: 40' from a small tree DCL</p>\n<p><strong>R5</strong>: 40' from bolts DCL.</p>\n<p>The creek funnels through a narrow section between R5 and R6, but\nthere are no established anchors. It is possible to climb up and around\nthis obstacle on CL.</p>\n<p><strong>R6</strong>: 60' from bolts DCL</p>\n<p><strong>R7</strong>: 45' from bolts DCL</p>\n<p><strong>R8</strong>: 130' from bolts DCR (located up on the wall of\nthe canyon).</p>\n<p><strong>R9</strong>: 35' from a log DCR</p>\n<p><strong>R10</strong>: 50' from bolts DCR</p>\n<p><strong>R11</strong>: 30' from a log DCL. It is possible to downclimb\nthis drop on both sides of the watercourse.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>The last rappel is only a few minutes away from the confluence with\nthe Taylor River. Exit back to the parking area on the same route as\nyour approach.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<p>A Northwest Forest Pass is required for parking at the main lot with\nthe pit toilet. Alternatively, pay a $5 day use fee in cash. As of June\n2020, the fees are not being enforced here due to closed facilities from\nCovid-19 (be aware of closed restrooms). There are no fee envelopes\navailable at the parking areas here. When fees are being enforced, you\nwill need to obtain a fee envelope about 0.25 miles back down FR 56 at\nthe Middle Fork trailhead. A forest pass is not required for parking\nfurther up the road at the gate.</p>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n<p>Huge thanks to Kevin Steffa who had scouted and shared the canyon\nwith the rest of us. The first full descent was completed on June 16,\n2018 by Kevin Steffa, Pt Choate, Gilly Elor, Haruka Lipscomb, and\nTiffanie Lin. On an earlier trip (May 28th), another team consisting of\nKevin Steffa, Sid Creutz, Gilly Elor, and Tiffanie established the\nbottom portion of the canyon.</p>\n",
