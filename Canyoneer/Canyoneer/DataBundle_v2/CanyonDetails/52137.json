{"url":"https:\/\/ropewiki.com\/Tesseract_Canyon","rappelLongestMeters":57.91,"waterRating":"B","permit":"No","rappelCountMin":9,"vehicle":"Passenger","description":"<div class=\"mw-content-ltr mw-parser-output\" lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><p>The Tesseract is a narrow and committing box canyon and gorge on an unnamed creek \/ faultline draining a small basin on the northwestern side of the Enigma Range (Mt Garfield Massif). The route begins with a 300’ waterfall dropping into a narrow box canyon just above 2350' in elevation. Below the box canyon the creek has a less steep pitch, but maintains a series of scenic bedrock cascades and pools down to the river bottom.  While it can be difficult to navigate, there is an easy walk in after a somewhat exposed steep scramble near the top. \n<\/p><p>Water flow in this canyon generally runs low due to its small catchment size. Mid winter flow during cold and clear conditions is roughly comparable to the late spring\/early summer melt stages, with peak flow likely during snowmelt in April. That combined with a low elevation approach makes access possible nearly year round depending on the local conditions.\n<\/p><p>The first sequence in this canyon is a technical multi-pitch rappel. Groups should have good rope management skills, and know how to rig a retrievable traverse line. It is recommended to bring enough rope to rig the first two pitches simultaneously. Damaging or getting a rope stuck on the first multi-pitch sequence could result in becoming trapped in the canyon, or worse, on the ledge in between the first two pitches. Abrasion minimization techniques are a must due the very sharp rock.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading4\"><h4 id=\"Avalanche_Warning\">Avalanche Warning<\/h4><\/div>\n<p>Tesseract is also prone to winter avalanches, filling up the box canyon with deep snow that can take well into the summer season to melt out. These avalanches do not happen every season, and may vary in the volume of snow deposited in the canyon. The creek flows under this snow and creates snow bridges, which become more unstable and creates risk of collapse as the snow melts. Attempting the canyon with significant snow is highly discouraged. Groups should be aware of the risk of avalanche debris, especially if the first group of the season when conditions are unknown. In mid-spring avalanche debris have been observed down to 1800' in the core of the narrow box section.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>A small parking area is available at the gate to the bridge\/old road that is the Taylor River Trailhead (parking option 1). If this area is full, you may have to park a few hundred yards back down the road (parking option 2). A pit toilet is available at the latter parking area <i>(as of September 2020, this toilet is closed due to Covid-19)<\/i>.\n<\/p><p>From the Taylor River trailhead, take a faint fishermans track just past the gate on the right. Work your way along the riverbank until you cross the Tesseract drainage. The fisherman's track itself disappears a short way in, and some bushwhacking is involved. Once the fisherman's trail peters out, drop down close to the river as soon as it's reasonable to do so. Travel is much easier closer to the river, rather than staying high. This route could use some maintenance at some point.\n<\/p><p>Alternatively to save time, when the Taylor River is low (usually late July through the end of summer), cross the bridge and take an easy walk about 500 yards down the trail, then cross the river. Do the same at the end of the day.\n<\/p><p>Cross the Tesseract creekbed. Heading up the hill on the north bank, the understory is generally open, with occasional thick patches of salal and vine maple. You will gain about 1,200' of elevation on the approach, and certain sections are quite steep. Starting in the late 1920's on up through the 1970's the Taylor Valley was logged, so most of the uphill approach here is in second growth timber. Along the river, there is a cautious mix of thorny salmonberry and devils club, with a friendly scattering of trillium, bleeding heart, and other floral\/mossy carpets. Avoid getting too close the edge of the canyon on the hike up where you may get cliffed out. The brush gets noticeably thicker towards the top of the approach.\n<\/p><p>At around 2250' elevation you will reach the base of a large cliffband. Traverse the bottom of the cliffband towards the canyon. You'll soon scramble up onto a broad rocky platform at the top of the falls that affords access directly into the Tesseract.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>DCR = Down Canyon Right\n<\/p><p>DCL = Down Canyon Left\n<\/p><p><br \/>\nThe canyon starts off with a multi-pitch rappel into the heart of the canyon. This particular section of canyon is prone to rockfall as well as avalanches in the winter months. It is possible existing anchors could become damaged. An emergency bolt kit is highly recommended, particularly for the first group of the season. Natural anchor options here are very limited\/non-existent. \n<\/p><p><b>Multipitch Rappel Sequence<\/b>\n<\/p><p><b>R1<\/b>: 185’ from bolts DCL to a narrow ledge DCL.
