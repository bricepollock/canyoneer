  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>Torrente Grisol is the largest, right tributary of Torrente Mae and\nis located in Val Zoldana valley near Longarone in Veneto region. The\ncanyon is mostly horizontal, with very deep part at its end and very\ndiscontinues and quite slippery. It is one of the most aquatic canyons\nin Veneto region and it ends into the Gola del Mae, which is one of the\ndeepest river canyons in the whole of Italy. Torrente Grisol is an\nextremely aquatic canyon with some hard jumps, long swimming corridors,\nmany white water passages and turbulent plunge pools. The most beautiful\npart is at its lower part where you swim through very deep canyon in\ncalm water and the high walls rise up at both sides. For a successful\ndescent stable weather and the correct period of the year are very\nimportant. During most of the year there is too much water in the\ncanyon, only in September and October the waterlevel is low enough.\nTorrente Grisol offers you a real big white water adventure in wild\nenvironment.</p>\n<p><b>Before the descent, check the situation of the fixed rope, which\nwe left for the ascent from the Mae</b></p>\n<p><b>canyon! Take with you a safety device for ascending on rope!\n</b>The fixed rope is located at the tree on the left orographic side of\nthe bridge over the Mae in Soffranco, reach through the small door into\nthe metal fence of the bridge. A barely visible tiny path leads downhill\nalmost to the tree which is positioned 15 meters above the river bed and\na few meters to the left, at the confluence of Torrente Mae and Torrente\nGrisol.</p>\n<p><b>Zone:</b> Italy – Veneto – Longarone</p>\n<p><b>Dimensions:</b> Entrance: 690 m Exit: 540 m Height: 150 m Length:\n3000 m</p>\n<p><b>Period</b> September - October</p>\n<p><b>Times:</b> Approach: 0 min Progression: 3h Return: 15 min</p>\n<p><b>Shuttle:</b> Yes (3’5 km)</p>\n<p><b>Equipment:</b> Expedition (only 1 old piton)</p>\n<p><b>Rope:</b> 1 x 20m + 1 x 20m just in case that the fixed rope is\nnot there any longer for you to get out from the Mae gorge</p>\n<p><b>Highest waterfall:</b> 7 m</p>\n<p><b>Possible exit:</b> Yes (not evident)</p>\n<p><b>Maps:</b> Carta Tabacco 25</p>\n<p><b>Attraction:</b> Local</p>\n<p><b>Difficulty:</b> V4 a5-a6 III</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>From Belluno drive to Longarone. In Longarone take the road for Zoldo\n(Val Zoldana) and follow this road uphill to the first road turn on the\nleft, signposted Soffranco. Drive over the little bridge of Torrente Mae\nand park your first car on the left side of the bridge, at a quite big\nparking lot in Soffranco. With the second car drive uphill, follow the\nsigns for Val Grisol and follow this road to the first bridge over the\nTorrente Grisol. Cross the bridge and park your car on the small parking\nlot on the left. </p>\n<p>Enter the canyon on the left side of the bridge over the Torrente\nGrisol.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>As soon as you enter the creekbed, a strong tributary from the right\n(Ru di Forca), enters which doubles the water in the canyon. After a\nshort section of walking, the canyon narrows and we need to swim through\nsome short swimming passages. A three meters high jump into a turbulent\npool leads us to the first white water section. After this section, we\nhave to swim across a large pool in calm water. The rock is very nicely\nfractured in horizontally slabs (like in Rio Bianco) and at the end of\nthis pool we found the only equipped cascade in the canyon. Rappel from\none piton with rope on the left side about 6 meters into the water jet\n(not too hard in normal condition). Cross the large pool to the next\nwhite water passage. Don’t jump into this passage, but slowly slide into\nit, due to rocks in the water. After another short white water section\nand a short walking passage you are at the 6 meters high cascade. Jump\nfrom the left into the turbulent pool, which is not too hard to exit.\nNow, the canyon opens again and become more discontinuous with some\nwalking, down</p>\n<p>climbing and some short corridors which you need to swim through. You\nwill come to a small inlet from the left and soon to another from the\nright and after several meters you will notice a hanging bridge over the\ncanyon. Soon after the bridge you will come to the most dangerous point.\nThe canyon is very narrow at this point and in corridor with white water\nthere is a wedged trunk. Climb right on the ledge and down climb on this\ntree into the white water. After this section there is a tricky 5 jump\nand a long swimming corridor. Now follows a long walking section and\nafter this you will get to the very narrow corridor with huge walls\nwhich rise up at the both sides. This is the most beautiful and\nimpressive section of the canyon. Swim through this corridor to</p>\n<p>the other side. From now the canyon began very discontinues with long\nwalking</p>\n<p>sections on slippery streambed. After a big left turn and a huge wall\nhigh up on the right you will come to the last long narrow part. Walk\nand swim through this very beautiful long section to the confluence with\nMae river. At the middle of this section you will notice the bridge over\nthe canyon in Soffranco. The confluence with Mae is in a big canyon\nwhich is named Gola del Mae. Climb up on the fix rope. The canyon\ndownriver has not been descended successfully yet. All recent attempts,\nbe it by canyoning or by kayaking have ended in emergencies for the\nmountain rescue.</p>\n<div style=\"font-size:x-small; background-color:#f0f0f0;\">\n<p><i>C = cascade D = down climb D+W = down climbing and walking J =\nshout (jump) T = slide L = left R = right MC= hand line (traverse)\n</i></p>\n</div>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>Climb up on the fixed rope out from Gola del Mae and follow the tiny\npath (barely visible) to the left to the bridge over the Torrente Mae in\nSoffranco (15 min).</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><img src=\"rwl_de.png\" title=\"rwl_de.png\" alt=\"rwl_de.png\" /><a\nhref=\"http://canyon.carto.net/cwiki/bin/view/Canyons/TorrenteGrisolCanyon\">Canyon.Carto.net</a>\n: Torrente Grisol</li>\n<li><img src=\"rwl_it.png\" title=\"rwl_it.png\" alt=\"rwl_it.png\" /><a\nhref=\"http://catastoforre.aic-canyoning.it/index/forra/cod/BL044\">Catastoforre\nAIC-Canyoning.it</a> : Val Grisol</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n<p>First attempt: F.
