  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>Given all the class C river canyons in Sequoia NP, this \"canyon\" is a\nvastly different experience. It more like a mix of a Utah slot canyon\nand SoCal's Monkeyface, or at least through the extensive chimney system\nat the top of the technical route. Although the FD was in very low water\nflow, in May or June (even July on a wet year) the water flow could\neasily be class C and make for a wild ride down the chimney system, even\ndangerous consider its narrow width and numerous chock-stones and\nshallow pools. If the flow is too high, the chimney system can be\nbypassed since there are hugely wide slabs on right side. If you enjoy\nchimney climbing, much of the chimney is perfect width for butt to feet\nstemming, and or wide leg stemming and thus can be down-climbed easily\nin the dry spots, and carefully where wet. Although there is no brush\nissue in the technical section (except one rappel through a bush), the\napproach once you leave the trail has quite a bit of brush (no poison\noak though), and the exit has a ton of brush, and lots of poison oak. I\nwill say that if you stay in the Moro Creek exit water course, you will\navoid most all the poison oak, and get to do many short down-climbs and\nwade through pools, some chest deep.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>Park the lower shuttle vehicle at the trailhead beyond Buckeye Flat\ncampground, or if the gate is locked at Hospital Rock parking lot. Drive\nthe other shuttle vehicle to Crescent Meadow parking, East of Moro Rock.\nFrom Crescent Meadow parking head South West 0.5 miles on Sugar Pine\nTrial, then go cross country when the trail diverges from the creek bed.\nFollowing the Crescent Creek bed for another 0.5 miles through brush and\ntrees, down slabs and a few short downclimbs you will reach the top of\nthe descent with a spectacular view.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>Start by down-climbing into the top of the lengthy \"slot canyon\"\nChimney System until you get to small pool and where down-climbing below\nis obviously wet. Below which you will want to rappel, unless it's\ntotally dry as the chimney is super slippery any places that is wet. On\nthe FD we used:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>R1 ~20' nuisance rap from submerged rock in watercourse</li>\n<li>R2 ~100' tree DCL traverse out to the tree, then rappel back into\nthe chimney</li>\n<li>R3 ~100' pinch watercourse</li>\n<li>R4 ~100' wedged stick behind a horn DCL and level with top of\nchimney</li>\n<li>R5 ~45' DCL stick pinched above large chock-stone spanning\nchimney</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You may want to break up the longer rappels in the chimney, because\nthe pulled rope can easily catch on the various chock-stones and rocks.\nOn the FD, we got our rope stuck in one spot, and had to chimney climb\nback up to free it. There is one pool in the chimney that is\nsurprisingly chest deep, so plan accordingly for gear and clothing will\nget soaking wet!</p>\n<p>This is the end of Chimney System and a good place for Lunch. Below\nthis location, all the rappels are down the head-wall slabs and shallow\ntroughs in and out of the water flow.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>R6 ~200' off bush anchor over a drop-off angling up right (serious\npendulum issue)</li>\n<li>R7 ~150' off webbing high on a pine tree just DCL of the water\ncourse with thick big bush directly below</li>\n<li>R8 ~140' big oak tree 140' well DCL on a ledge</li>\n<li>R9 ~95' from slung boulder DCL</li>\n<li>R10 ~140' from a large Manzanita bush DCR down to several small\nledges in the water course under a small overhang. The top ledge under\nthe overhang has a ravenous rope eating crack. All ropes lowered, tossed\nor pulled from this side will end up stuck in this crack. One can\ncontinue the rappel 240' to a large ledge, but <em>the last person MUST\nstop here!</em>' The rope will get stuck here when pulled.</li>\n<li>R10 Alternate ~240' Use trees or other anchors on DCL.</li>\n<li>R11 ~100' Sling the flake forming the ravenous crack. Have fun\ngetting rope out of the rope eating crack in the pool.</li>\n<li>R12 ~100â€™ rock cairn DCL on big ledge DCL down a flat slab to a\nshallow pool. There is an easy down-climb around R12 DCR through the\nbrush.</li>\n<li>R13 ~185' from a slung rock chock DCL after a bit of down-climbing\nfrom the pool above.</li>\n<li>R14 ~80'ghost from tree down to the thicket below and the end of the\nhead-wall slabs.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Once in the creek bottom, do not got down the water course. The brush\nis insanely thick and there is a steep V trough with chock-stones below.\nInstead, climb up out of the creek bottom DCL onto a narrow shelf that\ntraverses out to 2 trees, one dead, one alive</p>\n<ul>\n<li>R15 ~150' ghost from the 2 trees</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Below this it's easy enough to down-climb DCR over a big boulder and\nto much easier terrain below.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>From the last rappel, head down Crescent Creek with some boulder\nhopping, short downclimbs, using animal runs (mostly DCL) and sometimes\nwell above the creek level, and try to avoid the poison oak. Soon you\nwill reach slabs DCL that are easy to walk down to a short dropoff. You\ncan rappel this dropoff, or go back up DCR to a downclimb. Below this\nyou are in Moro Creek, and it's a combination of brush, poison oak,\ndownclimbs, pools to wade through. I generally found the creek bed\nitself to have no poison oak, but sometimes thick brush and plenty of\ndownclimbs, some on slippery rock. Thus, choose your poison wisely! :)\nIn one mile from the last rappel your will reach an open area and wide\nslab with the creek running through slot. At the bottom is a short\ndropoff (downclimb DCL) and a rock wall DCR below. This rock wall marks\nthe exit trail. Hike up the trail 500 feet (horizontally) to the\ntrailhead parking lot.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<p>Since this is inside Sequoia NP, you need to pay the entrance fee to\nget in/out of the park during business hours.</p>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<p><a\nhref=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/583118321723884/permalink/3133753843326973\">https://www.facebook.com/groups/583118321723884/permalink/3133753843326973</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n<p>Rick and Dominik had eyed this route in years past, but never got\naround to running it, mostly because it's normally class B or even A in\na dry spell.</p>\n",
