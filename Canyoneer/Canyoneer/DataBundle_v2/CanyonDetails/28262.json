href=\"http:\/\/ropewiki.com\/Woodward_Creek\">Woodward Creek<\/a>.  With a significantly smaller watershed than the main fork, this creek may be a good choice when other creeks are running at extreme levels.  LWW can sport higher water earlier in the season, but seems to become beginner-friendly in about March or April.  The creek diminishes to a trickle in summer. Don't bother if you're looking for water.  LWW sports mostly short drops and ramps;  all the rappels are pretty friendly.  There are some beautiful areas of exposed bedrock.  Good training creek.\n<\/p>\n<ul><li>Water catchment: 0.6mi^2.<\/li><\/ul>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading3\"><h3 id=\"Lower_Trailhead\">Lower Trailhead<\/h3><\/div>\n<p>From SR 14, follow Woodward Creek Rd north ~2mi to an intersection and turn right (unsigned). The road is paved, but is in the process of being reclaimed by the forest. Follow the road downwards approximately 0.5mi to a small pullout on the left just before a bridge across the West Fork of Woodward Creek. There is room for a couple vehicles.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading3\"><h3 id=\"Upper_Trailhead\">Upper Trailhead<\/h3><\/div>\n<p>Head back out and turn left at the junction.  Follow Woodward Creek Rd south ~0.6mi and take a right on Mars Landing Rd.  Follow ~0.5mi to Jct 953 (end of county road).  Turn right onto Duncan Creek Rd (not signed) for another 0.4mi to another junction.  2WD vehicles can make it at least this far. The road ahead, however, gets progressively worse as you approach the clear-cut.  High clearance and likely 4WD might be able to make it further.  In 2017:  we got as far as the clearcut, then parked when the road became a muddy swamp. Higher up there were a number of logs down across the road. You're likely better off parking and hiking the rest of the way in. Do not block any roads.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading3\"><h3 id=\"Approach_2\">Approach<\/h3><\/div>\n<p>Continue on up the road to a Y-jct. Turn right here and follow the old logging grade east a short distance to a second Y-jct. Here, bear right again and follow the overgrown powerline access track downwards to the southeast.  At the last tower, turn left onto another access track which serves an even smaller powerline heading off to the north.  This road grade varies from pretty good to very overgrown.  Keep following the road northward. You can keep going to where the powerline corridor crosses Little Woodward, but it's faster to break off into the forest just before you get there and and thrash down to R1. It's best to suit up before the bushwhack.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<ul><li><b>R1:<\/b> 40ft ramp.

It is literally just before Little Woodward reaches the main Woodward Creek.  Look on the right side of this tree (not obvious until you are close) to spot a dirty root ladder which can be used to scramble up the bank.  Atop the bank, locate a faint use path which traverses above Woodward Creek before eventually descending to a swampy area under the powerlines.  The trail dumps you into a small creek heading into the swamp... follow it.  Keep going wherever is easiest until you can easily exit the creek DCR.  This area has become quite overgrown. About 10ft away is a large fallen tree (marked with tape in summer 2018).  Duck under the tree and find a faint trail leading to the lower parking area. For folks accustomed to bushwhacking the fast exit should take about 10min.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Red_tape\">Red tape<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>None.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Beta_sites\">Beta sites<\/h2><\/div>\n<ul><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20210527212206\/www.canyoneeringnorthwest.com\/Little-West-Fork-Woodward-Creek\">CanyoneeringNorthwest.com (archive.org)<\/a> &#160;: Little West Fork Woodward Creek<\/li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http:\/\/ropewiki.com\/User:Super_Amazing_Map?id=Little_Woodward_Creek_(West_Fork)_-_Washington\">Super Amazing Map<\/a> &#160;: Little Woodward Creek (West Fork)<\/li><\/ul>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Background\">Background<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Creek was first descended by Keith Campbell and Kevin Clark in 2015.\n<\/p>\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nParsed by mw‐api‐ext.codfw.main‐6779cc57fc‐sqkbz\nCached time: 20240914192011\nCache expiry: 2592000\nReduced expiry: false\nComplications: [show‐toc]\nCPU time usage: 0.008 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.009 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 36\/1000000\nPost‐expand include size: 0\/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 0\/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 2\/100\nExpensive parser function count: 0\/500\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0\/20\nUnstrip post‐expand size: 0\/5000000 bytes\nNumber of Wikibase entities loaded: 0\/400\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%    0.000      1 -total\n-->\n<\/div>","rappelCountMax":9,"vehicle":"Passenger","longitude":-122.0641,"version":"f5e4821358ea7e4fc6230ccf328aa80c2178b9d53bff7260c2951f3f87c9cd91","timeRating":"III","rappelLongestMeters":null,"quality":2.3,"name":"Little Woodward Creek","waterRating":"C","rappelCountMin":7,"months":["Apr","May","Jun","Jul"],"technicalRating":3,"riskRating":null,"url":"https:\/\/ropewiki.com\/Little_Woodward_Creek","id":28262,"latitude":45.6547,"permit":"No","shuttleSeconds":900}
