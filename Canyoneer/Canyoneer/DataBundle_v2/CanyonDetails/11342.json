This route is currently (Dec 2015) free of brush from the fire road to Fox Creek.  Historically this route has been an aggressive bushwhack due to the narrow topography and minimal water flow.  This route provides an interesting alternative to other Fox Creek approaches.\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>The full approach is described in the beta for Great Falls of the Fox:\n<\/p><p><a href=\"\/w\/index.php?title=Great_Falls_of_the_Fox&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Great Falls of the Fox (page does not exist)\">Great Falls of the Fox<\/a>\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Lots of down-climbing and one mandatory rappel.  100' of rope will get you to the ground without any exposure.
