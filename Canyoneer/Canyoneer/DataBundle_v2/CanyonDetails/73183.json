There is a well worn flat trail to the creek which will be reached in 5-10 minutes.  The Check point is from several viewing platforms above the creek when you first reach it from the parking. Turn upstream, and hike for another 10-15 minutes.  This a popular sightseeing trail with 2-3 turns down towards the creek. These are often strung with old nylon rope to trees for handlines that sightseers will use for assistance on the steep descend on slippery dirt to the creek. The second righthand access trail leaving the main creek trail will descend to the start of the canyon which arrives at a large pothole with a 10-15' rappel or toboggan to start the canyon.\n<\/p><p>Interesting tidbit: In 2009 a rockslide above the creek flushed down numerous boulders that were previously underground. Those who investigated the landslide found fossilized plants within the rocks strewn about. Many of these rocks with fossilized plants flushed down into Racehorse creek and are visible on the descent.

This rappel can also be an excellent 15' toboggan for those inclined. Note: The RDC side has a small shallow shelf before diving deeply into the pothole so be aware of that obstacle.  Stay directly in the waterflow in the center\/center LDC side into the pothole.  Check depth before committing as this pothole has seen changes in previous years..  Note: This obstacle may be up-climbed and repeated.\n<\/p>\n<link rel=\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\" href=\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1062633282\"> \n<div class=\"thumb tright\">\n<div style=\"display:table;\">\n<span class=\"mw-default-size\" typeof=\"mw:Error mw:File\/Frameless\">\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>Rap 2\/3 (now combined into a single rappel):  This was originally 2 distinct rappels separated by a pothole.  As of 2022, unfortunately the middle anchors in the pothole for rappel 3 had been destroyed requiring combination of what used to be rappel 2 and rappel 3 into single rappel from anchors high on the RDC side.  Unfortunately this skips the first rappel into the pothole and instead leads down a long, low-angle slab that leads to what used to be rappel 3.  From the lip of the waterfall, the drop is 30' freehanging to the water.  Note: This drop can be jumped, however, do take note that directly under the waterfall is only knee deep but as of 2022 becomes very deep quickly beyond the whitewater. ~30 jump.  The anchors for the original rappel 2 still exist and can be used to enter the pothole.  If you do this without rigging another rope from the high RDC anchors you will have to upclimb a semi-uncomfortable slab back up to the anchors.  The Combined rappel of 2&amp;3 will require ~60' of rope from the anchors high on the RDC side.\n<\/p>\n<link rel=\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\" href=\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1062633282\"> \n<div class=\"thumb tright\">\n<div style=\"display:table;\">\n<span class=\"mw-default-size\" typeof=\"mw:Error mw:File\/Frameless\">\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<link rel=\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\" href=\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1062633282\"> \n<div class=\"thumb tright\">\n<div style=\"display:table;\">\n<span class=\"mw-default-size\" typeof=\"mw:Error mw:File\/Frameless\">\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<link rel=\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\" href=\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1062633282\"> \n<div class=\"thumb tright\">\n<div style=\"display:table;\">\n<span class=\"mw-default-size\" typeof=\"mw:Error mw:File\/Frameless\">\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>Rappel 4: ~100' from Anchors on right or left down the slab into a midway pothole, then on to the terminal pool.\n<\/p>\n<link rel=\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\" href=\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1062633282\"> \n<div class=\"thumb tright\">\n<div style=\"display:table;\">\n<span class=\"mw-default-size\" typeof=\"mw:Error mw:File\/Frameless\">\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>Jump 1: just downstream of rappel 4 the canyon closes briefly and requires a ~10' jump from a boulder into a pool.\n<\/p><p>Exit up on the RDC side on obvious sightseer trails.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>From the Rappel 4 or the terminal jump, exit the creek and climb for 5 minutes back alongside it on obvious sightseer trails.
