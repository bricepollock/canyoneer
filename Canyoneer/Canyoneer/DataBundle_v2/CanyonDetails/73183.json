  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>Park at a pullout with an obvious sign indicating \"Discover Pass\nRequired\". There is a well worn flat trail to the creek which will be\nreached in 5-10 minutes. The Check point is from several viewing\nplatforms above the creek when you first reach it from the parking. Turn\nupstream, and hike for another 10-15 minutes. This a popular sightseeing\ntrail with 2-3 turns down towards the creek. These are often strung with\nold nylon rope to trees for handlines that sightseers will use for\nassistance on the steep descend on slippery dirt to the creek. The\nsecond righthand access trail leaving the main creek trail will descend\nto the start of the canyon which arrives at a large pothole with a\n10-15' rappel or toboggan to start the canyon.</p>\n<p>Interesting tidbit: In 2009 a rockslide above the creek flushed down\nnumerous boulders that were previously underground. Those who\ninvestigated the landslide found fossilized plants within the rocks\nstrewn about. Many of these rocks with fossilized plants flushed down\ninto Racehorse creek and are visible on the descent. Keep an eye out! <a\nhref=\"https://nwgeology.wordpress.com/the-fieldtrips/the-chuckanut-formation/field-trip-to-the-2009-racehorse-creek-rock-slide/\">https://nwgeology.wordpress.com/the-fieldtrips/the-chuckanut-formation/field-trip-to-the-2009-racehorse-creek-rock-slide/</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>Rap 1: ~10-15' rappel requiring around 20' of rope into a large, deep\npothole. This rappel can also be an excellent 15' toboggan for those\ninclined. Note: The RDC side has a small shallow shelf before diving\ndeeply into the pothole so be aware of that obstacle. Stay directly in\nthe waterflow in the center/center LDC side into the pothole. Check\ndepth before committing as this pothole has seen changes in previous\nyears.. Note: This obstacle may be up-climbed and repeated.</p>\n<p>Rap 2/3 (now combined into a single rappel): This was originally 2\ndistinct rappels separated by a pothole. As of 2022, unfortunately the\nmiddle anchors in the pothole for rappel 3 had been destroyed requiring\ncombination of what used to be rappel 2 and rappel 3 into single rappel\nfrom anchors high on the RDC side. Unfortunately this skips the first\nrappel into the pothole and instead leads down a long, low-angle slab\nthat leads to what used to be rappel 3. From the lip of the waterfall,\nthe drop is 30' freehanging to the water. Note: This drop can be jumped,\nhowever, do take note that directly under the waterfall is only knee\ndeep but as of 2022 becomes very deep quickly beyond the whitewater. ~30\njump. The anchors for the original rappel 2 still exist and can be used\nto enter the pothole. If you do this without rigging another rope from\nthe high RDC anchors you will have to upclimb a semi-uncomfortable slab\nback up to the anchors. The Combined rappel of 2&amp;3 will require ~60'\nof rope from the anchors high on the RDC side.</p>\n<p>Rappel 4: ~100' from Anchors on right or left down the slab into a\nmidway pothole, then on to the terminal pool.</p>\n<p>Jump 1: just downstream of rappel 4 the canyon closes briefly and\nrequires a ~10' jump from a boulder into a pool.</p>\n<p>Exit up on the RDC side on obvious sightseer trails.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>From the Rappel 4 or the terminal jump, exit the creek and climb for\n5 minutes back alongside it on obvious sightseer trails. Turn left at\nthe main trail and return to the vehicles.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<p>On a hot summer day there will be no shortage of irresponsible\npartiers enjoying the Pools. On occasion a few of the braver souls\nattempt things they shouldn't. Discourage this. Many an injury has\nhappened at the falls and it would be most unfortunate if the sight of\ncanyoneers encouraged bad behavior from non-canyoneers that resulted in\ninjury. Just be responsible.</p>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n",
