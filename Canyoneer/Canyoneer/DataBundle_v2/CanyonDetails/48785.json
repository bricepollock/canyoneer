  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>A significant tributary of the Lewis River whose source is the\nPinnacle Glacier on the NW side of Mt. Adams. This creek likely runs\nhigh all year from glacial melt. The upper section features several\nvertical rappels in the flow. The lower section picks up significant\nflow from Mutton Creek and is much more aquatic in nature. An excellent\ntraining ground for those new to aquatic canyoning, as the lower rappels\nall have walk arounds. <strong>NOTE #1:</strong> There are at least 5\nminor tributaries to the lower drainage. Mutton itself may have 3-4X the\nflow of Riley. The flow at the bridge is indicative of the flow in the\nlower section while the flow in the upper canyon is about 25% of this\nvolume. The creek also enters a tight-sided gorge below FR-23, which may\nbe worth investigating. The drop is estimated to be 20-25’ tall with a\nnice amphitheater.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>Park at the NF-23 and Riley Creek crossing on the SW side of the\nbridge. There is a flat pull out for 5-6 vehicles that makes for good\ncar camping.</p>\n<p>Cross the bridge and hike up the dirt embankment on a faint use trail\nto get into the open forest. The creek is on your right as you are\nheading uphill. Stay about 50 yards from the creek on mostly open,\nrelatively flat terrain. Once you get to the confluence of Mutton Creek,\nstay high and go left about 50 yards to a game trail going down at\n46.2329, -121.6094, where it is an easy walk down and you may be able to\nkeep your feet dry at the crossing. After crossing Mutton Creek, stay\nabout 50yds from Riley Creek as you go up. R1 is at 4,600 feet but you\nneed to first hike up to 4,650 feet and then descend down to it.</p>\n<p>You can see several of the raps before and after the confluence by\napproaching the edge. <strong>NOTE:</strong> Wasps were encountered in\nthe area in Sept 2023. An especially aggressive nest was encountered\nnear the rim at R3.</p>\n<p>Riley is glacier fed so flows can grow throughout the day. There is\nan additional drop above R1 but it is a 1/2 mile upstream. There is also\none below the NF-23 bridge that is 1/2 mile downstream.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p><em>Upper Canyon</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>R1</strong> webbing DCL, 35’, overhead, in the flow. Sharp\nedge. Creeping the rope is recommended.</li>\n<li><strong>R2</strong> webbing DCR, 115’, overhead, in the flow.</li>\n<li><strong>R3</strong> single bolt DCL, 125’, overhead, in the\nflow.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>20 minutes of creeking, or walk in the forest DCL avoiding patches of\nDevils Club. Enjoy the blueberries!</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>R4</strong> webbing DCL 40’, low angle.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>30-40 minutes creek walking while passing the Mutton Creek confluence\n- may be advantageous to use the game trail on the rim to get to the\nnext portion.</p>\n<p><em>Lower Canyon</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>R5</strong> webbing DCL, 35’, past a logjam. Avoids most of\nthe flow.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>15-20 minute creek walk, through a scenic channel.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>R6</strong> webbing DCR, 15', in 2 tiers. 1st tier is 10'\nvertical drop into a small cauldron then swept down a 2' pourover into a\nshort swimmer. NOTE: POTENTIAL DANGEROUS HYDRAULIC IN HIGH FLOW.\nOptional walk around.</li>\n<li><strong>R7</strong> webbing DCL, 30', 2 tiers, out of flow. There is\na large log to cross in the pool, and another log in the pool DCR, and 2\nexiting the pool to a short stage 2. Stage 2 was deep and jumpable in\n2023. Both stages of this could be a jump if the logs are ejected. Check\nbefore jumping. NOTE: IN HIGH FLOW LOGS COULD PRESENT A DANGEROUS\nSTRAINER. Optional walk around.</li>\n<li><strong>R8</strong> webbing DCR log, 25’, out of the flow. Position\nthe webbing Creek Center or DCL to rappel in the flow.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>Creek walk 5 minutes to a place where there is a flat and clean entry\ninto the forest DCL. Walk 5-10 minutes to the road through clean\nunderstory.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<p>Most of the canyon is located in the Mount Adams Wilderness Area.</p>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<p><a\nhref=\"https://youtu.be/4uSbzONqoWY\">https://youtu.be/4uSbzONqoWY</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n<p>First scouted by Tim Burke and Melinda Muckenthale in 2016.
