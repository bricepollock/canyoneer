Named after a plantation discovered by\nthe party at \"Pot Hill\" - the terminus of the Waratah Ridge road. Bob\nsault writes \"The \"Dope\" in Four Dope Creek was as much to do with\npeople being silly enough to go canyoning on a cold, rainy, unpleasant\nday. Doug drove that day, and was in the usual hurry to get back to\nSydney for church.\"</p>\n<p>Also known as \"Birthday Suit Bertie Canyon\" after Bob Sault's attire\n(or lack of) during part of the canyon. Doug Wheen said that \"Birthday\nSuit Bertie canyon has a certain ring to it\".</p>\n",
