Go downstream. We ghosted this on the first descent, and it's a GREAT canyon to ghost! Leave anchors if you have to, but see if you can leave nothing but footprints. No beta here, as it's an easy canyon and it's more fun to figure it out yourself (otherwise, this canyon really doesn't have a lot going for it!). A fiddlestick is nice, and the longest rap is 150 ft.
