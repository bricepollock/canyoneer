Go downstream. We ghosted this on the first descent, and it's a GREAT canyon to ghost! Leave anchors if you have to, but see if you can leave nothing but footprints. No beta here, as it's an easy canyon and it's more fun to figure it out yourself (otherwise, this canyon really doesn't have a lot going for it!). A fiddlestick is nice, and the longest rap is 150 ft. Rock tends to be pretty sticky most of the time, so the downclimbs are good.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Once you're done rappelling, bushwhack back to the trail.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Red_tape\">Red tape<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Beta_sites\">Beta sites<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Background\">Background<\/h2><\/div>\n\n\n<\/div>","longitude":-121.5383,"rappelCountMin":6,"timeRating":"III","riskRating":null,"waterRating":"C","geojson":null,"name":"Crater Lake Creek Canyon","latitude":47.7045,"version":"970a4e5661ad224d5ff70b92cdfe971ef2a5d18955befb7959eaa07c9184b1d4","permit":"No","quality":0,"url":"https:\/\/ropewiki.com\/Crater_Lake_Creek_Canyon","id":57682,"months":["Jul","Aug","Sep"],"vehicle":"High Clearance","rappelCountMax":6,"rappelLongestMeters":45.72,"shuttleSeconds":null}
