  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>This creek drains Crater Lake and is the source of the Tolt\nReservoir. If you do this canyon, you might pee in Seattle's water\nsupply (not really)!</p>\n<p>It's a bit sloggy to get to the canyon (and crater lake), and the\ncanyon has no jumps, slides, etc. Just some raps. Ghost 'em if you\ncan!</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>Trail to crater lake</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>Get to crater lake. Go downstream. We ghosted this on the first\ndescent, and it's a GREAT canyon to ghost! Leave anchors if you have to,\nbut see if you can leave nothing but footprints. No beta here, as it's\nan easy canyon and it's more fun to figure it out yourself (otherwise,\nthis canyon really doesn't have a lot going for it!). A fiddlestick is\nnice, and the longest rap is 150 ft. Rock tends to be pretty sticky most\nof the time, so the downclimbs are good.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>Once you're done rappelling, bushwhack back to the trail.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n",
