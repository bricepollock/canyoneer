Afterwards the waterflow practically doubles, but it is\nnot a problem as the riverbed is always large enough. At the end awaits\na nice 45m Fall, where the waterjet is thrown several meters away from\nthe rock, very impressive (but probably only during snow melting\ntime).</p>\n<p>Note that the 2 Waterfalls before the last big one were not equipped,\nbut can be avoided quite easily.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>Stop at 1620m of altitude and walk up again to the car.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n",
