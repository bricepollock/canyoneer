Head up the very steep hillside until you reach the rock outcrop. Climb over or around the rock outcrop and start heading down to the creek on the upstream side.\n<\/p><p>Alternatively, you can start right from the road for a 0 minute approach!\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Rappel 1: 5m rappel from tree on river right (RR).\n<\/p><p>Rappel 2: Two pitches. 1st pitch is from a tree on RL, approx 10m. This pitch crosses the flow to RR, where you'll find the 2nd pitch. Pitch 2 is from a tree on RR. The stance is on a comfortable ledge that can hold 3-4 people. The length is approximately 30m.\n<\/p><p>Rappel 3: Rappel 3 is also two pitches. After you pop out of the upper gorge and onto the road, go to the obvious small tree on RR. It is recommended to use temporary rigging on this small 5m rappel, since local yahoos will still any permanent rigging. Pitch 2 is from an inline chain anchor on the concrete retaining wall. In higher flow, be wary of the concentrated flow coming out of the pipe. Approximate height is 40m.\n<\/p><p>Rappel 4: Once again, two pitches! Climb up to the large tree on RR for Pitch 1. Descend approx 20m until you reach two ring anchors on the RR wall. Pitch 2 is approx 20m with an interesting log to navigate.\n<\/p><p>Rappel 5: 10m off a tree directly in the watercourse.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>After Rappel 5, you can exit up the steep embankment on RL.

We went up the creek as high as 3200ft to check out the top waterfalls. This is absolutely not worth it, since there are a ton of downed trees in the canyon.\n<\/p>\n\n\n<\/div>","months":["Apr","May","Jun","Jul"],"waterRating":"B","rappelCountMin":1,"rappelLongestMeters":35,"url":"https:\/\/ropewiki.com\/Galena_Creek","id":86696,"version":"0718fa31a89ebc22af780febe5735a622a0b5c36c26a522b1f8f6307780e8d13","riskRating":null,"geojson":null}
