Head up the very steep hillside until you reach the rock outcrop. Climb over or around the rock outcrop and start heading down to the creek on the upstream side.\n<\/p><p>Alternatively, you can start right from the road for a 0 minute approach!\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Rappel 1: 5m rappel from tree on river right (RR).\n<\/p><p>Rappel 2: Two pitches. 1st pitch is from a tree on RL, approx 10m. This pitch crosses the flow to RR, where you'll find the 2nd pitch. Pitch 2 is from a tree on RR. The stance is on a comfortable ledge that can hold 3-4 people. The length is approximately 30m.\n<\/p><p>Rappel 3: Rappel 3 is also two pitches. After you pop out of the upper gorge and onto the road, go to the obvious small tree on RR. It is recommended to use temporary rigging on this small 5m rappel, since local yahoos will still any permanent rigging. Pitch 2 is from an inline chain anchor on the concrete retaining wall. In higher flow, be wary of the concentrated flow coming out of the pipe. Approximate height is 40m.\n<\/p><p>Rappel 4: Once again, two pitches! Climb up to the large tree on RR for Pitch 1. Descend approx 20m until you reach two ring anchors on the RR wall. Pitch 2 is approx 20m with an interesting log to navigate.\n<\/p><p>Rappel 5: 10m off a tree directly in the watercourse.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>After Rappel 5, you can exit up the steep embankment on RL. If you veer closer to the canyon as you get closer to the top, you'll pop out right at your car!\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Red_tape\">Red tape<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Beta_sites\">Beta sites<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Background\">Background<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>First descended by Mike Peterson, Haruka Lipscomb, and Andrew Humphreys in May 2024. We went up the creek as high as 3200ft to check out the top waterfalls. This is absolutely not worth it, since there are a ton of downed trees in the canyon.\n<\/p>\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nParsed by mw‐api‐ext.codfw.main‐6779cc57fc‐hpng5\nCached time: 20240914191919\nCache expiry: 2592000\nReduced expiry: false\nComplications: [show‐toc]\nCPU time usage: 0.005 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.006 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 21\/1000000\nPost‐expand include size: 0\/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 0\/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 2\/100\nExpensive parser function count: 0\/500\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0\/20\nUnstrip post‐expand size: 0\/5000000 bytes\nNumber of Wikibase entities loaded: 0\/400\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%    0.000      1 -total\n-->\n<\/div>","rappelCountMax":5,"latitude":46.4046,"version":"1161f03b6fe4ce087bd1eb3a0d4921077f8a3a47d9b859a5348daf3af9e2a76f","longitude":-121.8251,"rappelCountMin":1,"technicalRating":4,"geojson":null,"quality":3,"shuttleSeconds":null,"rappelLongestMeters":35,"waterRating":"B","permit":"No","url":"https:\/\/ropewiki.com\/Galena_Creek","riskRating":null,"vehicle":"Passenger","name":"Galena Creek","months":["Apr","May","Jun","Jul"]}
