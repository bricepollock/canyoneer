It is fairly beginner friendly if you exclude the big 280 foot rappel at the head of the canyon. For those who did not bring a 300 foot rope there is an easier 65 foot entrance rappel just down and across the canyon.  If you choose to do the big 280, it is much easier to leave the 300 foot rope at the top and retrieve upon your return from the canyon. There is a small arch\/bridge at the top of the 280 foot rappel that makes a great place for a webbing anchor. Also note that there is a fairly sharp edge at the top of the 280 foot rappel that can eat a rope's sheath pretty quickly. If opting for the 65 foot entrance rappel there is not much of the canyon missed by this shorter cut in.   Most beta and trip reports mention trips down Egypt 2 and up Egypt 3 which is a great trip in and of itself. For those wishing for a shorter, half day trip there is a very scenic exit at the end of Egypt 2 canyon (DC Right) that takes you back up to your exit shuttle vehicle parked on the Egypt road.  The views on the way up and on top are simply amazing!  If no shuttle vehicle exists you can walk the one mile back up the Egypt Road to your where you parked your entrance vehicle.\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>From the town of Escalante, Utah drive 5.1 miles east to the Hole In the Rock Road (HITRR).  Turn left and drive your High Clearance Vehicle 16.75 miles down this road. At this point turn left onto the Egypt Bench road and drive your high clearance vehicle 8 miles to the Egypt 2 Canyon Head.   There is space for several vehicles off the road.   Walk 50 yards to the top of the canyon.   Some have backed a vehicle up to the edge and anchored a 300 foot off the bumper.  Others have used the small arch at the top DC right.  The 280 foot rappel is a partial free hang in places.  Double check the friction level on your belay device.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Use_this_approach_if_bypassing_the_280_foot_head_wall_rappel.\">Use this approach if bypassing the 280 foot head wall rappel.<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading3\"><h3 id=\"Exit_Vehicle\">Exit Vehicle<\/h3><\/div>\n<p>Leave an exit vehicle parked on the Egypt Road at about  37°34'23.31\"N 111°15'8.99\"W (E2 ParkEnd).\nThis is a mile down the road from the upper entrance parking area of E2. This can be done without an exit vehicle.  Once out of the canyon walk the mile up the road to your entrance vehicle.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading3\"><h3 id=\"Entrance_Vehicle\">Entrance Vehicle<\/h3><\/div>\n<p>Just past the Head of E2 approximately .17 miles up the road park at 37°34'57.78\"N 111°14'28.04\"W (E2 ParkStart)\nThere is room for about 2 or 3 cars maximum just off the side of the road.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading3\"><h3 id=\"On_Foot\">On Foot<\/h3><\/div>\n<p>From the parking spot head southeast, then down into a drainage and then south and slightly downhill to approximately 37°34'41\"N 111°14'27\"W (E2 StartFirstRap).  This is about a .37 miles from the entrance vehicle. As you approach the drop in point the canyon will be directly on your right.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading3\"><h3 id=\"Entrance_Rappel\">Entrance Rappel<\/h3><\/div>\n<p>Here you will find several ledges with large and medium sized boulders that may have webbing anchors attached.  There are several good sized boulders with which to build good webbing anchors.  When we last visited this place there was some bright orange webbing attached to some medium sized shrubs (yikes).  We removed this webbing and did not use the shrubs for an anchor.  Please use appropriately colored webbing&#160;:) A rappel from these ledges to the bottom of the canyon is about 65 feet. From the bottom of this rappel take a short jaunt up canyon to see what you missed by not doing the big 280 foot rappel.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Once in the canyon proper there is a short jaunt to the next rappel.   This one could be down climbed by the skilled but there is good webbing anchor placement points for those who choose to rappel.  The rappel is in the range of 35 to 40 feet and has a fairly awkward start to it adding to the fun.\n<\/p><p>From there it is the usual Utah slot canyon fun with more down climbing, chimneying, hoppin n' droppin.  There are a couple of potholes that have to be crossed but with partner assists they are easily defeated.  If they contain water they are much more fun - slippery rides start with muddy sides.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>From where the canyon opens up it is another .20 miles down to where an easily ascended slab of Navajo sandstone  extends to the canyon floor. This is located DC Right at 37°33'48.02\"N 111°14'51.23\"W (E2 Exit Slab). To the left of this slab is a drainage coming in from the North West. Climb the center of this slab and head in a North Westerly direction across several small drainages towards the easily climbed upper ledges that you will traverse to get to the top.  As you climb these ledges there will be a canyon that comes into view on the right.  This canyon is Egypt 1.5 (aka Bobo).  Keep this canyon to your right as you ascend these ledges.  There are some reddish brown streaks (hematite source maybe) that vertically line the very top Navajo sandstone cliffs. Head towards those as you climb. The streaks are in the area where you climb up and out. Once on top it is approximately .16 miles to your exit veh\n<\/p>\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nParsed by mw‐api‐ext.codfw.main‐6779cc57fc‐r7p7h\nCached time: 20240914192007\nCache expiry: 2592000\nReduced expiry: false\nComplications: [show‐toc]\nCPU time usage: 0.006 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.007 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 24\/1000000\nPost‐expand include size: 0\/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 0\/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 2\/100\nExpensive parser function count: 0\/500\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0\/20\nUnstrip post‐expand size: 0\/5000000 bytes\nNumber of Wikibase entities loaded: 0\/400\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%    0.000      1 -total\n-->\n<\/div><div class=\"mw-content-ltr mw-parser-output\" lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><p>icle and or the Egypt Road 37°34'23.31\"N 111°15'8.99\"W.\n<\/p><p>If you didn't get enough canyon in your canyon, you can exit by climbing up Egypt 3.
