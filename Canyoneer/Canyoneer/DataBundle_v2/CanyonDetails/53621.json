  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>THIS IS A BIG WALL MULTI-PITCH EXIT RAPPEL. THIS IS NOT A\nCANYONEERING ROUTE. The Yosemite Falls canyoneering route is named <a\nhref=\"Yosemite_Falls_(Middle_Earth)\" title=\"wikilink\"><strong>Middle\nEarth</strong></a>.</p>\n<p>Some mountains have \"climb me\" written all over them. Some waterfalls\nhave \"descend me\" written all over them, and Upper Yosemite Falls is one\nof them. The question is just how to descend a 1500 foot waterfall on an\notherwise blank looking face? The horizontal extent is about 200 feet\nfrom the observation deck at the top to the pool at the bottom. And the\nwaterfall is seasonally so powerful that even standing near the bottom\nis like being in a hurricane! Descending Upper Yosemite Falls safely\ntakes serious logistical planning, proper skill set for building anchors\non big walls, being able to handle long rappels, and the falls in mostly\ndry conditions.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>This is the easy part! :) Find Yosemite Falls Trails at the back of\nthe Camp 4 parking lot, and hike 3.6 miles up the 2700 feet gain to the\nobservation deck with your massive amounts of rope and gear. And if you\nare just hiking up for the view with no gear, that's cool too. Because\nthe view along the trail in spots, and from the various viewpoints of\ntop is world class, especially when the water flow is way up!</p>\n<h2 id=\"rating\">Rating</h2>\n<p>If this descent were a \"canyon\" it would be 4A V R for the first\ndocumented descent, 12-14 October 2018.</p>\n<p>The \"A\" rating is based on the conditions, which was extremely low\nflow over the falls, and just 2 weeks earlier it was bone dry. As such\nwe had occasional whiffs of light spray in a few places on descent line;\nthus making a light rain jacket and pants sufficient to stay completely\nwarm. In the spring the water flow could be 1000x and most of the\ndescent line would be a torrent of powerful spray, making it crazy,\ninsane, or even deadly to try to descend per the rappel stations listed\nbelow. Note that the water temperature varies from just above freezing\nin spring to 40+F (5+C) late summer. Thus any significant spray on the\nline means that most likely a dry-suit would be needed to stay warm. Do\nnot underestimate the hypothermia danger of this descent!</p>\n<p>The \"4\" &amp; \"R\" rating stems from the rigging complexity, potential\nissues with \"pull downs\" and final 450 foot rappel anchor off a sharp\nhorn that needs careful attention to any webbing looped around it.</p>\n<p>The \"V\" rating represents the 2 nights and 3 days of the October 2018\ndescent, but certainly could be just one long day with a strong\nteam.</p>\n<h2 id=\"gear\">Gear</h2>\n<p>Recommended group gear includes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>1x 660 foot (200m) rope</li>\n<li>2x 600 foot (180m) ropes</li>\n<li>1x 165 foot (50m) rope</li>\n<li>1x 50 foot (15m) rope</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Traditional protection (trad pro) climbing rack for building anchors\nwith:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Active Cams (Black Diamond sizes) 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.75 and\n1</li>\n<li>Nuts (medium to larger size, 1/4\" to 3/4\" thick) about 10 of them\n&amp; nut tool</li>\n<li>3x Cordelette's or 5/8 webbing to build trad pro anchors</li>\n<li>6x free biners and or quick links</li>\n<li>6x locking biners for anchors</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Natural anchor building:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>60 feet of 1\" tubular webbing</li>\n<li>6x quick links</li>\n<li>4x rope edge protectors</li>\n<li>1x rope grab to hold one edge protector</li>\n<li>50 feet of small cord for rigging edge protector</li>\n</ul>\n<p>FRS radios with fresh batteries for everyone!</p>\n<p>Recommended in addition to normal canyoneering personal gear:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>rappel device that does not twist the rope such as a caving rack, or\nat least a device verified to minimally twist the ropes that will be\nused</li>\n<li>adjustable safety lanyard, PAS with many loops, or climbing daisy\nchain; allowing secure, minimal extension to pass re-belays</li>\n<li>two mechanical ascenders that can be used one-handed with tethers,\nand preferable rigged for an efficient rope climbing system (such as a\ncaving Frog) just in case retreat back up becomes needed</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"descent_overview\">Descent Overview</h2>\n<p>Rappels and Anchors:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>R1 150ft + 30ft + rigging webbing fixed-line from the cedar tree\nWest of railing, angle off plumb slightly West (RDC)</li>\n<li>R1alt 180ft from pine tree (webbing anchor installed OCT 2019) about\n30 feet West of the railing, rappel plumb to small ledge 150 feet below\nrailing ledge.</li>\n<li>R2a 230ft fixed-line from 2x5ft ledge with trad pro anchor behind 8\nfoot tall flake</li>\n<li>R2b 240ft fixed-line from small ledge/tower with trad pro (hanging\nstation)</li>\n<li>R2c 200ft+15ft fixed-line from 6 inch wide ledge/tower/plate with\ntrad pro at your feet (hanging station) to reach Oasis Ledge.</li>\n<li>R2d_new 15ft pull-down from 2 tiny nuts (installed AUG 2021)\nstanding on the big boulder on Oasis Ledge.

For the Oct 2018 descent, we rigged our ropes\nfixed-line the first day from the top to the bottom using the stations\nlisted in the Descent Overview. This was done to make each rappel more\nreasonable length between places to actually stand on any little ledge,\nwhich eases seat harness discomfort, and allows for more people to be\nrappelling concurrently. And most importantly we did this to make sure\nthat all the ropes present would reach all 1600 feet down to the deck\nwhile not having to cross a knot from a hanging position on rappel.\nAlso, should retreat be necessary, ascending shorter sections is much\nless likely to chew up the rope from abrasion, since it was easy to\nmanage rope protectors where these anchors are located and the rope\nbends over the ledge. And these anchors allow for multiple people to\nascend concurrently too. But this does mean each subsequent person on\ndescent had to cross each of the intermediate anchors (R2a, R2b, R2c)\nusing the standard caving re-belay technique. On the second day, all of\nthe R2 trad pro anchors were removed by the last person down, so this\nperson was always rappelling off the R1 anchor (tree at top) with the R1\nrope tied to the R2 rope, totaling over 800 feet of rope. This allowed\nfor all the trad pro to be removed. Once the rappel party was all safely\non the massive Oasis Ledge (top of R3) then the rope tender group (at\nthe cedar tree up top) pulled up both R1 and R2 ropes, pack them up, and\nhiked down the the approach trail. Side note: the Oasis Ledge is totally\nsafe for at least a dozen people to be there off-rope in a non-exposed\nposition. Then the rappel group on the Oasis Ledge completed the last\ntwo rappels as pull downs with 2x 600 foot ropes, using one rope for R3\nand both ropes for R4.</p>\n<p>Note that for the Oct 2018 descent we used a 150 foot rope for R1\nthat was extended up top 20 feet from the tree, a 600 foot rope for R2\nthat was 40 feet short of the Oasis Ledge Tower (first place to stand 10\nfeet above the Oasis ledge) so it was extended with another 80 foot\nrope. Thus the recommendation for a 165 foot for R1 and a 660 foot for\nR2 should be plenty to make Oasis Ledge (top of R3). But just in case\nhave an extra 50 feet of rope handy to be sure and make Oasis Ledge\nwithout having to connect one of the recommended 2x other 600 foot\nropes.</p>\n<p>It might be tempting to do R2 as a 660 foot pull-down rappel, but\ngiven the that the Oasis ledge is actually a large plate system, and\nwith all the wind typically present, the chance of the 660 foot rope\npiling up out of reach behind large flakes or on the opposite side of\nthe Oasis Ledge Tower (see pic below of blocks making this tower) is\nextremely high. Thus this is not recommended. However, if all the trad\nanchors are left in place and all the intermediate R2 anchors are used\nas pull-down rappels, then the last one at ~200 feet is manageable.\nStill the last person down needs to stop on the Oasis Ledge Tower and do\nthe pull down from there to be sure and retrieve the falling rope side\nshould it go on the opposite side of the tower. Then that last person\ndown will have to down climb the 10 feet of flaring chimney (partner\nassist workable here) or rappel off another built anchor to reach the\nOasis ledge (see pic).</p>\n<p>The R3 anchor on Oasis Ledge was constructed with nice pinch point\nand a solid knot chock, both extended a bit over the edge so the pull\nfrom small ledge at R4 is easy. The wall is smooth, so there should not\nbe any pull-down issues. The R4 anchor was constructed with several\nslings around a large horn with sharp edges. The anchor could be\nimproved by filing / bashing / grinding off the sharp rock edges a bit\nand or adding additional large trad pro to the crack adjacent to the\nhorn. This anchor is also about 20 feet above the only small ledge below\nthat allows for one person to comfortably stand. We extended the webbing\nso the block was easily within reach standing on the ledge, after the\nfirst person down rigged the last rope fixed off the anchor directly.\nAlso, just before R4 goes free (some 350 feet) one member reported a\nsharp horizontal edge, so a rope protector held with a easy to remove\nand install rope grab would be useful. We did not install a rope\nprotector here, and did not note any rope abrasion afterwards, but just\nin case, it's a good idea.</p>\n<p>Another goal of the Oct 2018 descent was to establish a line where\neach rappel is true plumb, instead of having to pendulum off plumb.\nThere are 2 exceptions to this for R1 and R3 (as noted in the descent\noverview) in that both rappel are slightly to the West, RDC, or to\nrappeller left (facing the wall) in order to reach the next anchor\npoint. Both of these anchors could be easily reset to make them true\nplumb For R1 there is another pine tree further West (see pic) that most\nlikely would be true plumb with the R2a ledge. Similarly, an alternate\nR3 anchor could be build on the Oasis Ledge which would be true plumb to\nthe R4 anchor. Going slightly off plumb was no issue with dry granite,\nbut with more water flow, the granite will be slippery, and thus the\ncloser to true plumb the easier it will be to get from anchor to\nanchor.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent_development\">Descent Development</h2>\n<p>If bolted stations were installed, this descent would be far easier\nto do. However, given that all the bolts would be hand drilled if done\nlegally, this is a extremely time consuming task. Removable trad rock\npro and standard \"natural\" webbing anchors work very well here, and the\nspacing is totally workable. As such, I feel this descent should not\nbolted, because installing and using natural and trad rock pro anchors\nmakes the journey even more challenging, adding a level of fun that I\nthink should be enjoyed by future parties, not diminished by installing\nlots of bolts. Maybe breaking up the last rappel with one bolted station\nright where it goes free would be nice. Anyway, my two cents worth.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>After touchdown on 450 foot R4 (the last rappel), pendulum over West\non the slab using extra rope (thus 500 recommended) to avoid going into\nthe big pool. Once the first person is down, the rope end can be\nanchored off to the side to make it easier each person down to pull off\nplumb and avoid the pool. With the water flow up, the whole area will be\nwet with spray, and so going into the pool may be the only realistic\noption. Of course in such wet conditions, the whole party will be using\nfull body wetsuits and or drysuits, so it likely will not matter to go\nswimming at the end. Getting out of the pool on the pour-over side looks\neasy enough but has not been verified. With significant water flow, this\nmay require some ground base rope work and a throw line to assist with\nsafe pool exit.</p>\n<p>Once away from the slick slabs, cross the boulder field to the West\nback to the main Yosemite Falls trail. Note that the boulder field can\nbe quite slick with water spray when the water flow is up. In very low\nflow, the slabs and boulder field are totally dry and trivial to cross.\nAlso, under very low flow it's easy enough to traverse under the\nwaterfall to the East, hike down to the last Rappel of Middle Earth (may\nneed a rappel to get to the last rappel) and do the 400+ foot Lower\nYosemite Falls rappel in one shot. And for those with time to burn and\nalready dressed to kill (wetsuit / drysuit), do Middle Earth as a bonus\ncanyon exit! :)</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<p>A backcountry camping permit is required if doing any normal\novernight camping up top or for bivy'ing on the wall itself:<br />\n<a\nhref=\"https://www.nps.gov/yose/planyourvisit/climbingpermits.htm\">https://www.nps.gov/yose/planyourvisit/climbingpermits.htm</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<p>NPS webcam for checking the waterflow: <a\nhref=\"https://www.nps.gov/yose/learn/photosmultimedia/webcams.htm\">https://www.nps.gov/yose/learn/photosmultimedia/webcams.htm</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<p>FIRST DESCENT TRIP: Photo album of Oct 2018 descent: <a\nhref=\"https://www.facebook.com/scott.swaney/media_set?set=a.10156801456582930&amp;type=3\">https://www.facebook.com/scott.swaney/media_set?set=a.10156801456582930&amp;type=3</a></p>\n<p>Short video of the Oct 2018 descent: <a\nhref=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHisifBUthI&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;fbclid=IwAR1Atv67RIsilEh8IY0x3vmeJ4XUqUAXf5zR2DU9rpJ1Gis3YUxNeknEE30\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHisifBUthI&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;fbclid=IwAR1Atv67RIsilEh8IY0x3vmeJ4XUqUAXf5zR2DU9rpJ1Gis3YUxNeknEE30</a></p>\n<p>Scott's FB thread: <a\nhref=\"https://www.facebook.com/668617929/posts/10156794688342930/?comment_id=10156800525212930\">https://www.facebook.com/668617929/posts/10156794688342930/?comment_id=10156800525212930</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n<p>This big wall climbing site has info on Oasis Ledge as well as the\nclosest climbing line (\"World of Pain\" FA 1991) to the Oct 2018 descent\nline: <a\nhref=\"http://www.yosemitebigwall.com/yosemite-falls-wall?fbclid=IwAR1z2c7SRp7vBwoDLUBQDCzqxokH24w1I3w_fOifYtdx431XTQH2OffzvEU\">http://www.yosemitebigwall.com/yosemite-falls-wall?fbclid=IwAR1z2c7SRp7vBwoDLUBQDCzqxokH24w1I3w_fOifYtdx431XTQH2OffzvEU</a></p>\n",
