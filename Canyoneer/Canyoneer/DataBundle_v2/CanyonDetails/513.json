Dark, lumpy surfaces are mature biological soil crust: a mixture of cyanobacteria, mosses, lichens, fungi, and algae.\nYoung, living soil looks a lot like sand, and it needs to be left undisturbed for many years to mature and help plants grow. Just one footprint does years of damage.\nDark, mature soil crusts are the basis of life in this desert. One footprint destroys years of growth.\nThis remarkable soil community holds the sand together, absorbs moisture, produces critical nutrients for plants, and provides seed beds for new plants to take hold.\n<\/p><p><b>Please don’t walk on it. Stay on designated trails to protect living soil and plants.<\/b>\n<\/p><p><br \/>\nOne of three great loops (U-turn, NOT Tierdrop, Tierdrop) right off the park avenue trail head in Arches NP.  Low risk of flash flood, easy access with little exposure, and quick exit means you could do all three in one outing. \nNote, Tierdrop feature natural anchors only and webbing is NOT always in place.  In addition, the anchors are often far away from the drop point requiring either a lot of webbing to reach the edge or a dicey pull with increased risk of a stuck rope.  Always perform a test pull.\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Up rock gully. Approx 400 foot climb.

One is large rock 50 feet from drop point the other is tree located LEFT of canyon also 50 feet back from drop point.
