Continue on the trail to summit Angels Landing and return to the drop in, completing the canyon and picking up the same exit trail.\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Utilize the free Zion Shuttle by parking at the Visitor's Center and taking the shuttle to stop #6 The Grotto Trail.  Follow signs\/trail for Angels Landing.  Approximately 1 mile in, the trail turns sharp left into the narrows of Refrigerator canyon (denoted by the cooler temperatures).  The only and obvious footbridge on the trail marks the start of Lower Refrigerator.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>From the footbridge, follow the canyon downstream down a short narrow section of downclimbing that may be optionally rappelled depending on comfort level by webbing found in a log jam.\n<\/p><p>R1: 30' 2 bolted hangers LDC to a pool.  The pool can be bypassed by carefully traversing RDC above the waterline and jumping across to the large ledge.  You are now out of the narrow section and at the top of the headwall.\n<\/p><p><br \/>\nR2: 115' 2 bolted hangers RDC to a small, 3-person ledge.  Sequence thoughtfully for larger parties.\n<\/p><p><br \/>\nR3: 190' 2 bolted hangers on the ledge.  There are 4 total bolts and 3 hangers, but 2 have eroded and are unfit for rappelling.  Use the obvious choice.\nNote: measured R3 in June 2024 and it was decidedly less than 190', more like 170'.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Follow the canyon RDC downstream through a short section of boulder hopping.
