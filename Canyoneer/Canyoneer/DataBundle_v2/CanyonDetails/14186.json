  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>The highest rated canyon to date in Guadeloupe for good reason. The\nfirst rappel is certainly the most photogenic, with a sheer wall\ndescending into a long waterfall. There are 5 more rappels in this\ncanyon, a toboggan and a few small jumps.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>From the town of Basse-Terre on the western half of the island of\nGuadeloupe, follow the coastal road (N 2) 22 km (from the Basse-Terre\nairfield) northwards (through the villages of Vieux-Habitants,\nBouillante) until we reach the town of Pigeon. At the outskirts of\nPigeon we cross the Rivière (= river) Bourceau. About 380 m further on\nthe N 2 we turn right towards Birloton. After 750 m (from the N2)\nbranches the road.We first drive left here and come after 1100 m,\nfinally steeply down to the river Lostau (in which further flows above\nthe Bois Malaisé). Here once a bridge spanned the river (destroyed by a\ncyclone). There we leave the car for the exit. There are enough spaces\nfor 3 or 4 cars at this river, and be aware the road is very steep, so\nwe actually had to have all passengers exit our small rental car and\ngive it a push to make it up the hills. With the other car, the 1100 m\nback to the road junction and here then in a sharp angle left (road to\nthe settlement Négresse and direction Birloton). After about 2 km (from\nthe road junction) this road ends and we turn off the car for the\napproach (Same car park as for the Canyon Bourceau, altitude 290 m above\nsea level). From the parking area Bois Malaise shares with Bourceau, you\ntake the trail on the left at the end of the road (the trail on the\nright is to Bourceau). Once on the trail continue following the narrow\nfootpath to the drop in point. It will descend very steeply on the left\ninto a small drainage. The first rappel is exactly where you meet the\nwatercourse.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>From the end of the road we take the path on the left and follow the\nsignpost 'Piton de Bouillante'. The path climbs, partly steeply, about\n170 m up to the height 460 m above sea level. Here he branches. We take\nthe left path (almost straight ahead) following the signpost 'Piton de\nBouillante par l'Esperance'. The path no longer moves so steeply,\ncrosses a brook bed and about 30 minutes after the path branching opens\nus a clear view to the north of the woods. About 5 minutes further goes\ndown the left as such hardly recognizable path to the entry. The branch\nwas marked in 2013 with a cord loop li. on a tree at about 2 m height\n(see photo). We are here about 510 m above sea level. If we should have\nreached the border of the National Pak (sign), we have already gone too\nfar and have to go back about 130 m. The tracks lead us now steeply down\n(in doubt, rather on the right hold on the back) in an orograf. The left\nside stream of the Bois Malaisé, about 20 m (and a 25 m abseiler) above\nits mouth in the Bois Malaisé. (01h 00 ')</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>After the 5th and last abseiler (the accession ropeway from the side\nstream in the Bois Malaisé included) we walk and climb for about 30\nminutes further downriver. Then the river Losteau flows in from the\nright (altitude 135 m above sea level). Continue down the riverbed for\nabout 50 meters and then turn right up the bank to a path that runs down\nthe river towards the lower parking area. The path parallels the river\non the right bank as you head downstream. You will pass 2 old homesteads\non your way down, one is fenced and may have a guard dog present. After\nabout 20 minutes and the final crossing of the river Losteau we have\nreached this.
