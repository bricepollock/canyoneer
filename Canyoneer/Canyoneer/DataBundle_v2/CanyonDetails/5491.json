However after dropping in at the highest point of the canyon where the fire road crosses it (34.2340, -118.1945) we immediately ran into a wall of brush...no big deal. Then it got ugly, a wall of poison oak. And that's where we drew the line and bailed. \n<\/p><p>Upon further scouting from the top it doesn't appear there are any rappels. But there is a possibility so I'll leave it at a \"3\" in case there are. Maybe someone not allergic to poison oak who likes bush-whacking will want to check the rest of the upper portion out when all the other canyons have been descended.\n<\/p><p>We ended up descending  <a href=\"\/w\/index.php?title=Brownside_Canyon&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Brownside Canyon (page does not exist)\">Brownside Canyon<\/a> instead. \n<\/p><p><a href=\"\/w\/index.php?title=User:A._Anderson&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"User:A.
