  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>\"We ALMOST did it, so you don't have to\"</p>\n<p>Dave Red &amp; I planned on checking out this canyon followed by the\nlower section (Aug 10th, 2014). However after dropping in at the highest\npoint of the canyon where the fire road crosses it (34.2340, -118.1945)\nwe immediately ran into a wall of brush...no big deal. Then it got ugly,\na wall of poison oak. And that's where we drew the line and bailed.</p>\n<p>Upon further scouting from the top it doesn't appear there are any\nrappels. But there is a possibility so I'll leave it at a \"3\" in case\nthere are. Maybe someone not allergic to poison oak who likes\nbush-whacking will want to check the rest of the upper portion out when\nall the other canyons have been descended.</p>\n<p>We ended up descending <a href=\"Brownside_Canyon\"\ntitle=\"wikilink\">Brownside Canyon</a> instead.</p>\n<p><a href=\"User:A._Anderson\" title=\"wikilink\">A.
