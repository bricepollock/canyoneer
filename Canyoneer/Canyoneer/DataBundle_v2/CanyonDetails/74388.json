  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>This is the largest of the 3 Coyote Canyon forks. It drains all the\nHenninger Flats area. It has 3 drop-in points: Sneak, Standard and\nExtended. From the Standard drop-in point, the Left Fork sports 15\nrappels, and a few easy downclimbs. It's an easier option compared with\nthe Right Fork, and without the extended steep drop off the Mt. Wilson\nRoad. In fact, from the road, dropping down just 30 feet next to the\nculvert pipe and you are at the first downclimb! Think of Coyote Left\nFork (standard drop-in) as Bailey without the bolts.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>Use the same approach options as per Coyote (Right Fork), but stop at\nthe 3rd bench, as you drop into the canyon off the Mt Wilson Tool road\nat 34.19097, -118.09075. On the West side of the ridge, look for the\nobvious steep trail down next to the steel culvert pipe. The R0\ndownclimb is immediately below that. If doing the sneak route, drop-in\noff the switchback 2 before at 34.18943, -118.09203. For the extended\nversion, hike all the way up to Henninger Flats, over to the picnic\ntables on the West side, and drop into the canyon somewhere up\nthere.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>From the Wilson Toll Road (just before the culvert pipe and bench\n#3), head down the steep earthen slope to the bottom of the culvert pipe\nand \"stacked\" concrete beam wall. Just below that wall is another\nconcrete beam wall that's easy to downclimb or rappel #0. Then you get\nto the first serious downclimb or rappel #1:</p>\n<p><strong>R0 15</strong>' down climb the concrete slats</p>\n<p><strong>R1 30</strong>' bush DCL (27NOV2022 black webbing), or\ndownclimb</p>\n<p><strong>R2 40</strong>' center bush (13MAR2023 black webbing), or\ndownclimb</p>\n<p><strong>R3 30</strong>' bush DCR (5NOV2022 black webbing)</p>\n<p><strong>R4 40</strong>' bush DCL (5NOV2022 black webbing)</p>\n<p><strong>R5 50</strong>' bush high DCR, (24DEC2022 long black\nwebbing)</p>\n<p>A couple low angle downclimbs follow</p>\n<p><strong>R6 30</strong>' bush DCR (24DEC2022 blue webbing)</p>\n<p>The sneak drop-in comes in here:</p>\n<p><strong>R7 10</strong>' bush DCL (5NOV2022 super old webbing), or\ndownclimb</p>\n<p><strong>R8 80</strong>' bush DCR, 2 stage (5NOV2022 rust webbing)</p>\n<p><strong>R9 70</strong>' bush DCR, also 2 stage (5NOV2022 rust\nwebbing) needs to be moved to DCL side</p>\n<p><strong>R10 25</strong>' bush DCL (5NOV2022 rust webbing)</p>\n<p><strong>R11 35</strong>' bush DCL (5NOV2022 rust webbing)</p>\n<p>After which you come to the bamboo maze. There is a path cut through\nit. The Right Fork joins in this bamboo area. After which is the last 3\nrappels (same as the Right Fork):</p>\n<p><strong>R12 25</strong>' bush DCL 10 feet back from drop (11NOV2022\nblack webbing) The big original anchor tree is dead and fell over\nhere.</p>\n<p><strong>R13 40</strong>' tree 30 feet back DCL (24DEC2022 60 feet of\n7mm black rope tied in a big loop)</p>\n<p><strong>R14 95</strong>' bush clusters DCR (11NOV2022 bush DCR with\nblack webbing) Note: you are directly under the power line here.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>Hike out the canyon floor all the way to the Eaton trail, or until\nyou can access a trail on the left side. Once at the Eaton trail, hike\nto where ever you parked.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n<p>It's clear that this fork below the Sneak drop-in has been run\nbefore, as there was 2 old webbing anchors (90's vintage webbing). Above\nthat there was no sign of any anchors, which is surprising since this\nwould seem to be the obvious fork of Coyote to run first.</p>\n"
