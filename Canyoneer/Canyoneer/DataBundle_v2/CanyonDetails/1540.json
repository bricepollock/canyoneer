and a packraft at the end down the Black Canyon section of the Colorado River. Part way through the canyon there are a few hot springs who's water is quite hot at the source, but cools down a little as it flows down canyon. A short 15ft rappel through the warm water with a bathing pool at the bottom is also a pretty unique feature of this canyon.\n<\/p>\n<ul><li>Please remember that installation of permanent fixed hardware is strictly prohibited in Black Canyon Wilderness Area, and the entirety of LMNRA.

Option 1 is Arizona Hot Springs, a .8 mile raft down the river. This requires a car shuttle however that is quite a bit longer. Option 2 is a pack-raft 2.8 miles down the river to the same exit point as Death Pit Canyon. In addition to the longer rafting this exit is a bit harder but cuts down the shuttle time considerably.\n<\/p><p>ALTERNATE CLASS 3 EXIT: This exit does not require a pack-raft or bushwhacking. After the last rap you will hike down canyon about 1\/4 of a mile until you come to a T junction in the canyon. The wash that runs off to your right is the one that you want to exit into. There is a track in the beta. If you choose to use this exit, you can use different parking for the TH. There is more information about the parking in the beta for Devil Eyes Canyon.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Red_tape\">Red tape<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Beta_sites\">Beta sites<\/h2><\/div>\n<ul><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http:\/\/bluugnome.com\/cyn_route\/lake-mead\/lake-mead_devils-drain\/lake-mead_devils-drain.aspx\">BluuGnome.com<\/a> &#160;: Devils Drain Canyon<\/li>\n<li><a class=\"external text\" href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/User:Super_Amazing_Map?id=Devil&#39;s_Drain_Canyon_-_Nevada\">Super Amazing Map<\/a> &#160;: Devil's Drain Canyon<\/li>\n<li><a class=\"external text\" href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/User:Las_Vegas_Slots_Book?id=Devils%20Drain%20Canyon\">Las Vegas Slots Book by Rick Ianiello<\/a> &#160;: Devils Drain Canyon<\/li><\/ul>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media<\/h2><\/div>\n<ul><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external free\" href=\"https:\/\/www.stavislost.com\/hikes\/trail\/devils-drain-canyon-loop\">https:\/\/www.stavislost.com\/hikes\/trail\/devils-drain-canyon-loop<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Las-Vegas-Canyoneering-Meetup-Group\/events\/46029752\/\">Meetup 25 Feb 2012<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http:\/\/candition.com\/canyons\/devils-drain-canyon\">Candition.com<\/a> &#160;:<\/li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external free\" href=\"http:\/\/adamhaydock.blogspot.com\/2017\/02\/devils-drain-bighorn-canyons-colorado.html\">http:\/\/adamhaydock.blogspot.com\/2017\/02\/devils-drain-bighorn-canyons-colorado.html<\/a><\/li><\/ul>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Background\">Background<\/h2><\/div>\n\n\n<\/div>","permit":"Yes","name":"Devils Drain Canyon","version":"155cd81586539769bfea784e2f547ba9135fb28c486b88d6de39bed306b57066"}
