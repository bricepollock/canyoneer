One could probably knock off a mile or\nso by getting dropped off further up the road where the trail come close\nto the road. A rather long but beautiful hike to the top of Lee Mountain\nand very close to the drop-in. There is a trail that appears on the\nother side of the steep drainage when it starts to get steeper on your\nhike as it takes you to the top.</p>\n<p>A 100ft rope and pull will get you through. After topping out head\nsouth along the rim and locate the lone tree on top of a high point. The\nwebbing should still be around that tree and directly across from the\nhuge rock island also. Rap down to a small saddle that separates two\nsteep drainage's and then scramble down the steep southwest drainage to\nthe second rap and so on. Take care to avoid kicking rocks loose on your\nteam below. It's a steep start.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p><strong>R1</strong>: 70' tree on beautiful outcrop</p>\n<p><strong>R2:</strong> 50' bush in drainage</p>\n<p><strong>R3:</strong> optional: 35' no anchor - might be better\navoided by scrambling around RDC</p>\n<p><strong>R4:</strong> 65' from bush and Boulder LDC in drainage</p>\n<p><strong>R5:</strong> can bushwack through the drainage and find an\nanchor off a sturdy bush which will take you down an uncomfortable\n(awkward start, have to rap through rope-grabbing bushes - not\nrecommended) 60' . Alternatively, you may be able to climb around LDC\nfrom back up canyon from here to a tree that looked like a nice anchor.\nThis rappel would take you onto slick rock, rather than bushes, and is\nprobably longer than 130' (Jay, what did you do here?).</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>Follow the drainage down to where it connects with the trail you came\nin on and back to your vehicle.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<p><a\nhref=\"https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.1950740021613095&amp;type=3\">https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.1950740021613095&amp;type=3</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n<p>First descent by Josh Marks and Jay Wisocki</p>\n",
