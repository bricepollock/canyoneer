It is unique in that is has multiple tunnels that are cave like and require a head lamp to navigate. They are pretty cool once in them and a couple spots require an army crawl to navigate.\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Take the Poison springs road West out of Baggs and drive to until the road bends (41.046783, -107.698257). There is a road that heads north. Take that road and park your car there and begin the approach hike up to the terrace.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Follow the canyon down with multiple natural bridges and tunnels. Make sure to have a light as the tunnels get very dark. There is one 15 ft dry fall that can be rappelled or down climbed (canyon right). There is no anchor built yet, if you plan to rappel bring anchor building materials. There are two significant tunnels, the first one you can walk most of the time. The second tunnel has a 10 ft down climb in it and a couple sections where you need to army crawl.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>When the canyon ends you should be able to see your vehicle\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Red_tape\">Red tape<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>None\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Beta_sites\">Beta sites<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Background\">Background<\/h2><\/div>\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nParsed by mw‐api‐ext.codfw.main‐6779cc57fc‐8xjwg\nCached time: 20240914191846\nCache expiry: 2592000\nReduced expiry: false\nComplications: [show‐toc]\nCPU time usage: 0.005 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.006 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 21\/1000000\nPost‐expand include size: 0\/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 0\/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 2\/100\nExpensive parser function count: 0\/500\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0\/20\nUnstrip post‐expand size: 0\/5000000 bytes\nNumber of Wikibase entities loaded: 0\/400\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%    0.000      1 -total\n-->\n<\/div>","id":50257,"rappelCountMax":1,"shuttleSeconds":null,"months":["Mar","Apr","May","Jun","Jul","Aug","Sep","Oct"],"permit":"No","technicalRating":2,"riskRating":null,"geojson":{"features":[{"type":"Feature","properties":{},"geometry":{"coordinates":[[-107.70392,41.05171,0],[-107.70482,41.05208,0],[-107.70516,41.05236,0],[-107.70624,41.05279,0],[-107.706764,41.052937,0],[-107.70708,41.05314,0],[-107.70733,41.05334,0],[-107.70774,41.053623,0],[-107.70789,41.053696,0],[-107.708,41.053844,0],[-107.70821,41.05399,0],[-107.70833,41.054367,0],[-107.708374,41.0548,0],[-107.708244,41.05496,0],[-107.708115,41.055275,0],[-107.707855,41.055702,0],[-107.70771,41.05606,0],[-107.7075,41.05661,0],[-107.70726,41.056885,0],[-107.70674,41.05711,0],[-107.706314,41.057045,0],[-107.70616,41.056892,0],[-107.70627,41.056835,0],[-107.70638,41.056828,0],[-107.70651,41.056866,0],[-107.70655,41.056854,0],[-107.7066,41.05682,0],[-107.70668,41.05679,0],[-107.706795,41.056747,0],[-107.70687,41.05671,0],[-107.70693,41.05656,0],[-107.706924,41.056507,0],[-107.706955,41.05644,0],[-107.707,41.056343,0],[-107.70702,41.05628,0],[-107.7071,41.056232,0],[-107.707115,41.056194,0],[-107.70713,41.05616,0],[-107.70706,41.05602,0],[-107.70701,41.05594,0],[-107.70698,41.055885,0],[-107.70696,41.055813,0],[-107.70693,41.055763,0],[-107.70689,41.055676,0],[-107.70685,41.055626,0],[-107.70676,41.055626,0],[-107.706726,41.055603,0],[-107.706696,41.05557,0],[-107.706696,41.05552,0],[-107.706665,41.055492,0],[-107.70665,41.055447,0],[-107.706635,41.055386,0],[-107.706635,41.055344,0],[-107.70658,41.055313,0],[-107.70657,41.055202,0],[-107.70657,41.05515,0],[-107.70656,41.055016,0],[-107.70656,41.0549,0],[-107.70659,41.05478,0],[-107.70668,41.05465,0],[-107.70668,41.054577,0],[-107.706474,41.05435,0],[-107.70638,41.054283,0],[-107.70626,41.054283,0],[-107.706085,41.054264,0],[-107.70588,41.054153,0],[-107.70581,41.054054,0],[-107.70577,41.053936,0],[-107.70569,41.053814,0],[-107.70564,41.053753,0],[-107.70566,41.053684,0],[-107.70559,41.053566,0],[-107.70551,41.05352,0],[-107.70553,41.05342,0],[-107.70553,41.053257,0],[-107.70552,41.05316,0],[-107.70544,41.053017,0],[-107.705376,41.05289,0],[-107.705284,41.05284,0],[-107.70479,41.05252,0],[-107.70455,41.05241,0],[-107.70415,41.0521,0],[-107.70391,41.051903,0],[-107.70391,41.051697,0]],"type":"LineString"}},{"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[[-107.7039,41.0517,0]]},"type":"Feature","properties":{"name":"Park Car"}}],"type":"FeatureCollection"},"vehicle":"Passenger","waterRating":"A","quality":3,"name":"Maggie's Ghost","timeRating":"I","longitude":-107.7064,"version":"08a3db3e673caa79f5fd227bbd00cc24b71678db41db61433144fd55dc93e685","rappelCountMin":0,"latitude":41.0569}
