A new anchor was added in December 2023, which, we believe, should alleviate these pull problems. If you do get a rope stuck, please let folks know on the Pacific NW Canyoning Facebook group, so we can get someone in there to remove it. This waterfall is a popular location, and it's not good to be leaving ropes hanging down the falls.\n<\/p><p>Cabin Creek can be combined with other creeks in the immediate area for a longer canyon day.\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Park at the Starvation Creek trailhead and hike west along the Starvation Ridge trail for 0.25mi. When you reach Cabin Falls, check that the flow is reasonable for everyone on your team. Retrace  your steps a short distance and follow the Starvation Creek Cutoff trail upwards for about 0.5mi. Just after rounding the nose of the ridge, you may see R1 below you. Drop down gentle slopes to the top of the falls. Beware poison oak.\n<\/p>\n<ul><li>If the Starvation Cutoff trail is closed, the approach is longer. Head west on the bike path for 0.3mi and turn off right to <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https:\/\/ropewiki.com\/Hole-in-the-Wall_Falls\">Hole-in-the-Wall Falls<\/a>. Cross the bridge and follow the trail upwards 0.2mi to a trail junction. Turn left here on the Starvation Ridge Trail and follow it back east 0.8mi to Cabin Creek.<\/li><\/ul>\n<ul><li>There is one more 15ft waterfall (R0) about 100 yards upstream of R1. It may not be worth your time.

The new anchor should help alleviate these problems. Per rope damage, it's not clear if the damage was from sharp edges or falling rocks. It may be prudent to slip\/creep the rope. There appears to have been a very sharp edge near a tree DCR halfway down the pitch which may have been the culprit. Stay DCL to avoid it.<\/li><\/ul><\/li><\/ul>\n<ul><li><ul><li>There may be some rockfall hazard.
