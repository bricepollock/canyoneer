Groups should be comfortable rigging these specific types of anchors.  If you find two bolts side by side that are unlinked, do not add webbing to them. This canyon utilizes a v-thread (aka rock thread) for a rappelling anchor. Treat these as marginal anchors and use appropriate techniques to back them up (e.g. human anchors, removable bolts, etc). The cordage is made from 5 mm pure dyneema and tied off using a triple fisherman's bend. \n<\/span><\/p><p><br \/>\nDCL = down canyon left; DCR = down canyon right; S = slide; DC = down climb\n<\/p><p><b>J1:<\/b> 30’ DCR.
