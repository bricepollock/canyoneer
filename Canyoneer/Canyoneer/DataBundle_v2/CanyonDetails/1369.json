{"timeRating":"II","rappelCountMin":3,"url":"https:\/\/ropewiki.com\/Las_Flores_Canyon","name":"Las Flores Canyon","description":"<div class=\"mw-content-ltr mw-parser-output\" lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><p>Simple canyon with convenient location, located very close to Pasadena. It has 2-3 rappels and some interesting mines to explore. This is a good route for beginners.\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Park at the end of Lake Ave in Alta Dena. Head East and take the second trail on the left. Trail is well traveled and busy with hikers. After about 3 miles on the trail you will reach the drop in point. If you happen to be running the canyon at night beware of the \"No parking after 8pm\" signs.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>The first rappel is almost immediate after dropping in from the trail. It is 20 foot rappel with a large tree for an anchor located about 20 feet from the rappel LDC for a total rope length of about 45'.\n<\/p><p>The second rappel follows soon after, and is about 30 feet. There is a good tree for an anchor located RDC about 15 feet from the rappel and about 10 feet up on a slope. Be cautious with the rope pull and anchor pull to not snag in any of the branches on the slope. You can also anchor it off a shrub LDC. There is loose rock here so beware on the rappel and rope pull. \n<\/p><p>About halfway down the canyon there is a mine entrance in the watercourse (banner image). This is a pretty nice mine for the area and goes back quite a ways. You have to crouch a little at the beginning but it gets taller. Expect to get wet about up to your thighs in some areas. \n<\/p><p>After a couple down climbs and a long distance the third rappel appears. It is about 30 feet tall. There is a large tree RDC up on a slope, similar to the second rappel. Notice the rusty pipes and metal debris directly on the rappel lip. If the rappel is done RDC there will be a slight free rappel with an overhang, but no metal pipes to damage the rope.\n<\/p><p>More information on the mines can be found here: <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external free\" href=\"http:\/\/www.lagoldmines.com\/index.php?page=916662.txt\">http:\/\/www.lagoldmines.com\/index.php?page=916662.txt<\/a>\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>After continuing down after the third rappel you will reach a small concrete dam with a ladder DCR. Do not continue down the ladder, exit the steep trail DCR. This will lead to a paved path which loops back to the start point.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Red_tape\">Red tape<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>None\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Beta_sites\">Beta sites<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Background\">Background<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Lots of graffiti and trash.
