  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>Fordham Canyon is a generally dry and very exposed canyon on the\neastern side of the Shoalhaven Gorge at Bungonia, just downstream of the\nBlockup Gorge. It has a series of large abseils that are technically\neasy, but have poor anchors, small landing areas, and plenty of loose\nrock. It is effectively a multi-pitch abseil down a dry waterfall, and\nis very rarely visited because of its remote location.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>Fordham Canyon may be approached from either the east (from Tolwong\nRd) or west (Carne Rd). While the approach from the east looks\nsuperficially easier, many of the trails Ettrema Plateau are\nlong-overgrown, and were obliterated by the 2019-20 fires. For this\nreason, access from the west, from the Stan Jones Carpark at the end of\nCarne Rd is probably recommended, and outlined below.</p>\n<p>Head along The Lookdown Rd from Bungonia township. Take a right turn\nonto Carne Road (fire trail). This turn is not clearly signposted, but\nis immediately before a large shed about 6.2km from the turn onto The\nLookdown Rd in Bungonia township. Follow this, going through two gates,\nwhich are often open, but leave them in the manner you found them.\nContinue along Carne Rd until you reach a large carpark with two locked\ngates (the Stan Jones Carpark).</p>\n<p>Depart the carpark along the Trestle Track, and follow the Blue Track\ndown to the Shoalhaven River. Cross the Shoalhaven at a series of\nsandbars about 1.8km upstream of the Blue Track, opposite the base of\nSivewright Spur. This is immediately opposite the spur directly south of\nFordham Canyon, and is where the Shoalhaven bends after exiting the\nBlockup Gorge.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, you can also descend Long Gully or Spring Creek Canyon\nto access the Shoalhaven. Either of these, combined with Fordham Canyon,\nmakes for an extremely long and exhausting day that will probably extend\ninto the night. You can also camp on the Shoalhaven; this is extremely\npleasant, and there is an often-used spot at the bottom of the Blue\nTrack.</p>\n<p>Climb this spur. Be extremely careful as it is quite loose and steep,\nwith some sheer drops. At Point 559, you want to turn generally north\nand drop down into the bed of the canyon.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>There are 6 pitches, all in quick succession. Beware of the anchors,\nseveral can produce poor pulldowns, and as they're exposed directly to\nthe western sun, CHECK ALL ANCHORS AND BE PREPARED TO REPLACE THE\nTAPE.</p>\n<p>Recommended to take multiple 60m ropes (eg 4x60m, or 2x60m +\npullcord), so that the back-to-back pitches can be rigged\nsimultaneously, as there are very small stances at some pitch heads.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>Return the way you came in, unless you used Long Gully or Spring\nCreek Canyon to get down to the Shoalhaven.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a\nhref=\"https://wejugo.com/adventures/canyoning-in-bungonia/\">https://wejugo.com/adventures/canyoning-in-bungonia/</a></li>\n<li><a\nhref=\"https://www.thecrag.com/en/climbing/australia/bungonia-gorge/route/1052237955\">https://www.thecrag.com/en/climbing/australia/bungonia-gorge/route/1052237955</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><img src=\"rwl_en.png\" title=\"rwl_en.png\" alt=\"rwl_en.png\" /><a\nhref=\"https://youtu.be/eUZrYPNoa1k\">YouTube.com</a> : Richard Pattison,\nFordham Canyon movie</li>\n</ul>\n<p>{{#ev:youtube|eUZrYPNoa1k}}</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a\nhref=\"https://fatcanyoners.org/2018/02/17/bungonia-canyoning/\">https://fatcanyoners.org/2018/02/17/bungonia-canyoning/</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n",
