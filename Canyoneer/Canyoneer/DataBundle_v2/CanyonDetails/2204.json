class=\"mw-content-ltr mw-parser-output\" lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><p>A significant tributary of the American River located east of Mt. Rainier National Park. It's a pretty canyon with surprisingly easy access and usually good flow even in the middle of summer. You do need to cross the American River on the approach and exit (wade or find a convenient log).\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading3\"><h3 id=\"Water_Flow\">Water Flow<\/h3><\/div>\n<p>The waterflow checkpoint is from the trail lookout over to the main falls. If you do not feel comfortable rappelling in the waterfall it may still be ok to run the canyon, as there is a high water route on canyon left that allows you to rappel out of the water.\n<\/p>\n<ul><li>Mesatchee Creek has a watershed of 2.58mi^2 and is north-facing. The highest point in the drainage is 6946ft high.<\/li><\/ul>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>From Chinook Pass, head east 6.75mi to a signed trailhead for the creek. Drive in a short distance to the trailhead. Northwest Forest Pass (or America the Beautiful Pass) required. \n<\/p><p>From the trailhead, follow the well-established trail about 0.9mi to where it crosses Morse Creek on a bridge. Turn south, and arrive at a crossing of the American River (usually on a log) in another 0.2mi. River was knee deep in July 2024. Another 0.2mi ahead is a trail junction. Bear left here and head uphill another 0.5mi to a viewpoint of Mesatchee Falls. At about 0.5mi further, the trail levels out. Descend steep slopes to your right into the creek. If you reach a small stream crossing, you've gone farther than you need to.\n<\/p>\n<ul><li><b>Special Note<\/b> - if planning to take the scramble exit directly out from the bottom of the final rappel, it's recommended to leave a 50ft fixed handline anchored off a tree at 46.8941, -121.4132 down the steep gully. The scramble up is relatively easy until the final 50ft where it's thin and loose. Slipping here would likely entail a no-fun 200ft fall.<\/li><\/ul>\n<ul><li>(Unexplored) It might be feasible to head downstream maybe 50-100ft from the final falls to find an easy hike\/scramble out DCR up to the trail. This exit looked lower angle and didn't look like a rope would be necessary.<\/li><\/ul>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>The first rappel begins at about 4150ft elevation.\n<\/p><p>There appears to be a lot of loose, crumbling rock in Mesatchee.

If downclimbing please stay in the channel and avoid harming the moss.<\/li>\n<li>R2: 75' from a tree DCR.  For ease of getting on rappel keep webbing towards creek center by placing it down under a notch; then for an easier pull last person can place over the top of the rock outcropping. Note that the rock where both the webbing and rope lie is sharp so mind the placement of both and consider placing something over the rock or creeping the rope.<\/li>\n<li>R3: 60’ from a tree DCL. There is a channel DCR at the bottom 20' be careful of foot entrapment.<\/li>\n<li>R4: 20' from a tree DCR. (Attempting to downclimb here not recommended per potential loose rock and minimal footholds. There has been an accident here.)<\/li><\/ul>\n<ul><li>R5: <b>Mesatchee Falls<\/b> - 150’ from a tree DCL in a pocket. The fall line right of center is smoothest and easiest. DCL is less in the flow but has a narrow channel and very bumpy making it high risk. The bottom 15’ is a downclimb.  There is a small cave or mine at the base of the falls.<\/li><\/ul>\n<ul><li><ul><li>If the big falls is running high, it's also possible to escape DCR from atop the falls.

When the canyon opens up, reach a trail. Turn right and follow back to the American River.<\/li><\/ul>\n<p>Return to the trailhead the way you came.
