  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>A nice short technical canyon in the Wynoochee Valley with easy\naccess and can be descended in a couple of hours. It's committing and\nthere's some cool geology and deep pools inside. Natural anchors are\nsparse on some of the drops; be prepared. Some rappels are now bolted,\nbut others will still require natural anchor building skills.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Middle Fork can be combined with other destinations in the\nWynoochee Valley - especially the Big Creek Narrows which is literally\n2mi away down the road. It's possible to easily visit 2-3 of them in a\nsingle day.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"directions\">Directions</h2>\n<p>From the intersection of FR 22 and FR 2294, follow FR 2294 for 2.5mi\nto a Y-junction. Go left for 0.3mi to a second Y-junction. Park here.\nThere's enough room for 1-2 vehicles. Do not block either branch of the\nroad when parking. The last falls is visible just upstream from the\nparking area.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>From the parking area, just walk up the road on the north side of the\ncreek. Keep going up until the road flattens out and bends right (all of\nfive minutes). Break off the road and thrash down into the creek\nwherever is easiest.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You could shuttle, but parking is limited up there. It's so short,\nwhy bother?</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Checkpoint is the falls visible from the parking area.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>The road is right above the canyon all the way up. It's possible to\ntake a peek down into the canyon in places to see what you're in\nfor.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>Pass through a short micro-narrows. The creek opens up a bit, but\ncontinue on another minute or so. The creek swings left, climb down a\nshort drop to the top of R1.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>R1/J1: 10ft from single bolt DCL, or jump DCL into deep pool (check\nfor debris first). Descending this rappel commits you to the\ndescent.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>A big logjam bars the way. Bypass DCR.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>R2: 20' from single bolt DCR. Downclimb two short drops (4' each)\nbefore arriving at the bolt station and the rappel. Some great pools\nbetween the tiers, interesting geology, and could possibly be\njumped.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>R3/J2: 12ft from cairn, DCL. This is a very deep pothole that can be\njumped if no debris has entered. Climb over logpile at the bottom and\ndownclimb the short step immediately below. Might be able to climb up\nthe wall DCR to bypass. A stream enters DCR at the bottom of this\nfalls.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>R4: 20ft per the horizontal (8ft vertical) from a log spanning the\ncanyon into a cool mini-slot / pothole from giant log leaning against\nthe canyon wall DCL. Rappel is a bit awkward as it's overhung.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>R5: 20ft ramp from a logjam across the creek. Can be downclimbed DCR\nbut don't slip. Some interesting potholes DCL at the bottom.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>Upon reaching the culvert, look DCR to find a user trail leading\ndirectly up to the road.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<p>None.</p>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n<p>First descended by Kevin Clark in Oct 2020. Found the creek while\nlooking for a campsite in the area. Came back the next day to run\nit.</p>\n",
