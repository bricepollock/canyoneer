It's committing and there's some cool geology and deep pools inside. Natural anchors are sparse on some of the drops;  be prepared.  Some rappels are now bolted, but others will still require natural anchor building skills.\n<\/p>\n<ul><li>The Middle Fork can be combined with other destinations in the Wynoochee Valley - especially the Big Creek Narrows which is literally 2mi away down the road.

Downclimb two short drops (4' each) before arriving at the bolt station and the rappel.  Some great pools between the tiers, interesting geology, and could possibly be jumped.<\/li><\/ul>\n<ul><li>R3\/J2: 12ft from cairn, DCL. This is a very deep pothole that can be jumped if no debris has entered.  Climb over logpile at the bottom and downclimb the short step immediately below.

A stream enters DCR at the bottom of this falls.<\/li><\/ul>\n<ul><li>R4: 20ft per the horizontal (8ft vertical) from a log spanning the canyon into a cool mini-slot \/ pothole from giant log leaning against the canyon wall DCL.
