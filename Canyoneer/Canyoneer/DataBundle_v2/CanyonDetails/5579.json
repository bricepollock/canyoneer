The road was washed out so now when you get there, park, and head up the left side of the watercourse. Stay to the left. When you reach the large boulder with a wood post cemented in the ground, the trail will fork left. You should defend into the watercourse and make your way up to the base of the falls. At the falls you will head to the right up the scree, burned out area, and hike\/climb up and around the backside of the large rock cliff face.  This is dangerous loose stone and scree.  At the top head up and over into the wash.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>The first obstacle can be fiddlestick off bay laurel trees dcl, or a root system dcl.  There is a 10 foot rappel here, or a down climb with a meat anchor assist as back up.\ndcl there are a few more down climbs and a rappel off another tree root system 15 feet to a chockstone.  Not: If you drop into the watercourse directly and follow it to the top of the falls you will miss the shelf with the chockstone and may not be able to get to it. The anchor is off a chockstone to the right above the pour-over in the falls. So it's a bit of a 2 stage. If you follow the watercourse you will end up below the shelf with the chockstone, with no anchor material. This chockstone has been a feature in the canyon for decades.  You will not find webbing there, so be prepared to use ghost techniques or install webbing.  From here it is 185 feet to the bottom.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Follow the use trail back to the fork, and then back the way you came.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Red_tape\">Red tape<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Beta_sites\">Beta sites<\/h2><\/div>\n<ul><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http:\/\/www.santabarbarahikes.com\/hikes\/frontcountry\/westfork\">Tangerine Falls via West Fork on Santa Barbara Hikes<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http:\/\/www.hikespeak.com\/trails\/tangerine-falls-in-the-los-padres-national-forest\/\">Tangerine Falls hike on hikespeak<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http:\/\/summitpost.org\/cold-springs-canyon\/582587\">SummitPost.org<\/a> &#160;: Cold Springs Canyon<\/li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http:\/\/www.world-of-waterfalls.com\/california-tangerine-falls.html\">Tangerine Falls on World of Waterfalls<\/a><\/li><\/ul>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>==Background==We descended this canyon in 2015.
