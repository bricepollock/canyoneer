  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>Lower Angel Creek is a great, short introduction to flowing canyons,\nor \"C\" class canyoneering. It is suitable for first-timers with the\nproper supervision. The entire route may take only 1 1/2 hours for an\nexperienced group, consisting of a 20 minute approach, roughly 1 hour in\ncanyon, and 20 minute exit. With first-timers, a large group and/or\nanchor-building it could take up to 4 hours. Like all canyon routes in\nand around Ouray, the season for Lower Angel is short, typically July\n4th weekend until the end of September. Lower Angel has one of the\nlongest seasons in Ouray, due to the relatively low elevation,\nrelatively low CFS, the possibility to avoid almost all direct waterfall\ncontact, and the numerous escape routes DCR. It is also one of the only\ncanyons in Ouray for which a wetsuit is not mandatory. Great for early\nand late season, as is Portland Creek just down the road. These two make\na great 2-fer combo on the same day.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>From the center of the town of Ouray, drive south on Highway 550 for\nhalf mile, turn right onto CR 361 also know as Camp Bird Road, a dirt\nroad. Go past the first right turn for the Ice Park. Continue on the\ndirt road for 2 miles to Angel Creek Campground, which is right after\nyou cross over Canyon Creek and on the right side. Park at the parking\narea as soon as you turn in. You are able to drive in further on the\ndirt road, but it is the drive for campgrounds only and any parking you\nsee is reserved for the campers.</p>\n<p>From the parking area at Angel Creek Campground, walk down the dirt\nroad past several camp sites until you see a sign straight ahead that\nprohibits motorized vehicles. The dirt road continues to your left and\nthere is another campsite, camp 8, on it. Follow the dirt road past this\ncampsite until it turns into a well well-worn single track trail. You\nwill soon see the drainage on your right. The trail gradually descends\nand the trees open up on the right revealing the creek. Walk down the\ntrail to a sandy beach with flat bedrock and change into your wetsuits.\nThe first rappel is downstream and the anchor can be seen on the rock\nDCL.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>Update (7/7/16): The bolts on R1 and R3 were chopped recently, and\nthey have been replaced with unlinked ring anchors (do not add webbing\nto these anchors). The bolts at R1 are difficult and exposed to reach;\nit is recommended to use a handline (traverse line) to reach these bolts\nsafely. There are bolts at all 4 rappels if you are so inclined, but\nfeel free to practice your natural anchoring skills with the beta\nbelow.</p>\n<p>You will get soaked on the first rappel. However, after the first rap\nit is possible to avoid getting wet above the knees so it is personal\npreference whether you want to don a wetsuit or not. A rain shell with a\nhood is my preference, as it's hardly worth the time to don and doff a\nwetsuit and then carry a wet wetsuit up the exit. The anchor for the\nfirst rappel is a rock pinch-point in the watercourse. The rap is 32'\nfrom the anchor to the floor. For a beginner, this may be a difficult\nstart. The going is slippery. Starting on one's side, on the hip, is a\ngood way to get started. Get in the water and enjoy. The second rap is\nsoon after the first one, not more than 5 minutes of down-climbing. When\nyou get to the ledge at the top of the second rap turn around and look\nback about 15 feet. The anchor is slightly DCR of the watercourse and is\na rock pinch-point. The rap is 28 feet but the drop is only 12 feet. It\nis possible to down-climb DCR but that way is getting quite a bit of\nman-made erosion and is unnecessary, so don't do this. Stay in the\nwatercourse to prevent further erosion and do what you came here to do,\nrappel in waterfalls. This drop has also been downclimbed on canyon\nleft, directly adjacent to the flow, though this downclimb is pretty\nscary. The third rap is shortly after the second, again, only about 5\nminutes of down-climbing. Take the time to look back at the succession\nof waterfalls. The section between the first and third raps is the best\npart of the route. The anchor for the third rap was a tree DCR and up\nthe slope about 10 feet. Unfortunately, from this tree you will miss the\nwatercourse. The rap is 50 feet, but the drop is only 40 feet. The\nwebbing can be extended another 10 feet. It is a fun rap down a dry\nflume (dry unless there is a torrential downpour). Historically this\ndrop had two bolted anchors on canyon right, 10 feet or so from the lip\nof the drop though they have gone through periods of chopping. Look for\nthe bolts before using the tree. Also birds have occasionally nested in\nthe nooks and crannies on canyon right just above the lip. Leave them in\npeace and stay on canyon right.</p>\n<p>From the bottom of the third rap to the top of the final rap is about\na 10-15 minute walk down the creek bed. It opens up a bit. The anchor\nfor the fourth rappel was two bolts DCL. It is a 12 foot rappel. This\nmay be difficult for beginners as you come off a huge chock-stone and\nhave to maneuver the start from a crack on one side of it and then you\nwill swing under it and go through the falls to an impressive little\ngrotto behind the falls. After swinging under, your feet will almost be\ntouching the ground. It is possible here to bring the rope DCR over a\nboulder and rap down from here and stay dry. If someone is missing a\nhelmet or is getting hypothermia this would be a good move, but\notherwise, you are missing one of the best raps. This drop has been\ndownclimbed many times and isn't as bad as it looks, though beginners\nwon't agree. Watch for steel wire that has been tangled in the rocks\nover the years.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>After the fourth and final rappel, you can take your gear off and get\nready for the hike out. Continue down stream for a few minutes. You will\nsee several downed Pine trees and climb over or around them. If you look\nto the right you will see a hand line coming down. This is the exit. If\nyou get to the confluence with Canyon Creek, retreat about 100 feet and\nlook to you left (heading up Angel Creek). Follow the hand line for a\ncouple hundred meters up the ridge between the two creeks. Once at the\ntop of the ridge, go straight onto the wide dirt path, which will take\nyou right back to the campground. Continue straight through the\ncampground passing all of the camp sites to your car.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a\nhref=\"http://ropewiki.com/Canyoning_in_the_Colorado_San_Juan_Mountains_Book\">Canyoning\nin the Colorado San Juan Mountains Book by Ira Lewis</a></li>\n<li><b><font color=blue>Current Water Level Assessment from Canyoning\nColorado:</font></b> <a\nhref=\"https://canyoningcolorado.com/canyon-reports\">https://canyoningcolorado.com/canyon-reports</a></li>\n<li><img src=\"rwl_en.png\" title=\"rwl_en.png\" alt=\"rwl_en.png\" /><a\nhref=\"http://hikearizona.com/decoder.php?ZTN=19549\">HikeArizona.com</a>\n: Lower Angel Canyon</li>\n<li><img src=\"rwl_en.png\" title=\"rwl_en.png\" alt=\"rwl_en.png\" /><a\nhref=\"http://ropewiki.com/User:Super_Amazing_Map?id=Angel_Creek_-_Colorado\">Super\nAmazing Map</a> : Angel Creek</li>\n<li><img src=\"rwl_en.png\" title=\"rwl_en.png\" alt=\"rwl_en.png\" /><a\nhref=\"http://icopro.org/canyon/view/id/284\">Icopro.org</a> : Angel\nCreek</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.example.com\">EVEN FURTHER-ANGEL CREEK</a></p>\n<ul>\n<li><img src=\"rwl_en.png\" title=\"rwl_en.png\" alt=\"rwl_en.png\" /><a\nhref=\"http://candition.com/canyons/angel-creek\">Candition.com</a> :\nAngel Creek</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n",
