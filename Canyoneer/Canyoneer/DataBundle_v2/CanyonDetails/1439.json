It has a feel similar to Bailey Canyon, but with more work involved. Aside from half-dozen or so rappels with easy anchors (one deadman), the canyon is technically easy. The drop-in involves some frustrating bushwhacking, but once in the canyon you're taking it pretty easy. There are a few short sections of bushwhacking in the canyon.\n<\/p><p>A 200ft rope and 200ft pullcord were used on the first descent. Bring 60ft of webbing and a half dozen links.\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Park one car at the West Fork\/Cogswell Dam Road parking lot at West Fork. Drive in the other car up to the Smith Mountain\/Valley of the Moon parking lot. Hike in from here up to the summit of Smith Mountain. You will have to decide which way is best to descend into the canyon. It may be wise to follow the canyon as precisely as possible to avoid some bushwhacking.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>There are no outstanding challenges in the canyon.
