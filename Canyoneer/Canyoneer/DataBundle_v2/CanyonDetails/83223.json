class=\"mw-content-ltr mw-parser-output\" lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><p>The following description was translated from UnoDeAventuras.com by Google Translate:<br \/><br \/>The Quilluyacu creek is another ravine in the Bucay-Humandá zone that we can describe as spectacular. And is spectacular by its cataract of about 140 meters high; that will make us release adrenaline for all the pores of our body. This cannon has several parts with quite differentiated characteristics. The first rapping of the descent is made in conglomerate. Then change the rock and we find the rolled rock area and shale in which the following rappels are formed; with beautiful waterfalls formed in narrow and aesthetic gorgas. Then we reach the key point of this ravine; The Beatriz waterfall. This is a very vertical cataract and of great technical difficulty; divided into four rappels; in which experiences experienced in the decrease of large verticals are required. The difficulty of the waterfall is mainly concentrated in its first rapel. This one has the header installed with two parabolts located quite back; since the rock close to the vertical is of poor quality and makes the placement of anchors difficult. This can hinder the recovery of the strings. Besides; The first dozens of the waterfall are very channeled and forces us to go down the water; so it is imperative that the ravine flow is scarce to facilitate the scope of the first meeting; located about 2 meters outside the water channel. To get to it we will have to make a pendulum to the orographic left; helped from a sheet located at an intermediate point. It is important to go down attentive not to spend this first meeting; Since tracing on the rope; In case of not seeing it; It could be complicated. At this meeting; more than 100 meters from the ground; There are two people; being quite vertical and uncomfortable. From here we will go down out of the water. The second section of this waterfall is approximately 42 meters; being much flown. We arrive at the next meeting; that something moves away from the fall of water and stones; located in a small shelf with space for three people and from which we will make the following rappel of about 40 meters. The third rappel of the waterfall; also vertical; It ends on a somewhat more comfortable and space for 4 people. We acted the fourth and last section; of about 30 vertical meters; arriving next to the base of the great cataract. In the base of the waterfall; The Quilluyacu creek is joined by the El Sural Quebrada; of which we will see his last waterfalls; Two peeles below the right also joins the channel of the Straits of Freedom. We continue with three other peers; with intermediate highlights; And we will end on the road where we will have left the return vehicle.\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Red_tape\">Red tape<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>No known.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Beta_sites\">Beta sites<\/h2><\/div>\n<ul><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http:\/\/unodeaventuras.com\/canyoning-ecuador-quebrada-quilluyacu?kmlidx=\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/Quebrada-Quilluyacu.kml\">UnoDeAventuras.com<\/a>&#160;: Canyoning Ecuador: Quebrada Quilluyacu<\/li><\/ul>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Background\">Background<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>First descent on July 25, 2018 by Elia Blesa; Kevin Oñate; Fausto Oñate; José Oñate; Edu Gómez and Javito Rodríguez.\n<\/p>\n\n\n<\/div>","vehicle":null,"waterRating":null,"timeRating":null,"riskRating":null,"rappelCountMax":15,"longitude":-79.0008,"version":"6125f2d7f72e8fbb050f1d175850d70a4c196c9379f24fa6caead976768ad041","quality":4,"months":["Jun","Jul","Aug","Sep","Oct","Nov","Dec"],"id":83223,"rappelLongestMeters":42,"rappelCountMin":15,"latitude":-2.128}
