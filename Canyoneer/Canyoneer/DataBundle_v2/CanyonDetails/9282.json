  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>High Falls is an excellent challenging canyon 30 min outside of\nSquamish. The full canyon is a long day out with 450 meters of vertical\ndescent. High Falls Creek is noticeably split by the large 110m\nthree-tiered waterfall in the middle of the canyon, with two massive\nhanging pools. Above the falls, the canyon is tight and narrow with\nsculpted passages and demanding water features. After the falls, the\ncanyon has towering walls (100m+) with consistent drops until the\nend.</p>\n<p>High Falls Creek is not to be underestimated. Much of the year the\nflow could be A5 or greater. The canyon is EXTREMELY slippery, so\ncaution must be taken when approaching edges. There are many false\nfloors created by log jams and a massive fragile logjam in the upper\nsection that demand climbing gingerly. Staying on top of the large\npieces of wood is generally best practice and avoid pulling sideways.\nThis canyon displays a high flow even in the midst of summer.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>Drive one vehicle up the forest service road to the top of the High\nFalls Creek trail, there is parking for 2-3 cars. From the road bushwack\n15m down to the obvious trail. Go right and hike down the trail about\n100m until a junction and the trail makes a 90 degree right turn. There\nis a knoll and clearing straight ahead and a clearing to the left. Leave\nthe trail, heading straight over the knoll and down where the forest is\nclear. After descending 30m you will see a cliff band on your right and\na very steep drop off ahead. Go right following the bottom of the cliff\nband for 30m or so, then turn left and downwards and scramble down an\nunlikely way directly down into the creek. You are aiming for 49.9462,\n-123.2917. Left or right of this point on either side will require\nrappelling.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p><strong><u>Upper Canyon</u></strong></p>\n<p>After dropping into the creek, proceed 50m or so to the first\ndrop:</p>\n<p><strong>R0</strong> - 15m off a log on Canyon Right. Scramble and\ncreek walk another 300m or so until the canyon narrows. Note: this can\nbe bypassed by following the trail another 10 minutes downstream, and\ndropping in just before the narrows.</p>\n<p><strong>Downclimb</strong> - 4m down a log choke. Will be difficult\nin higher flows, but natural anchoring for a rappel is possible.</p>\n<p><strong>R1</strong> - 8m off a single bolt on Canyon Right (CR)</p>\n<p><strong>R2</strong> - 28m on unlinked bolts on Canyon Left (CL). It\nis advisable to set a handline off logs approximately 7m away to\ntraverse over a false floor to reach these exposed bolts. This\nwaterfalls drops into a beautiful cavern like section.</p>\n<p><strong>Climb/Jump</strong> - Climb over a large log jam and jump 2m\nor so into the slot on the other side. This passage is one of the\nnarrowest in the canyons and leads around the corner to a large\nchockstone 2m overhead.</p>\n<p><strong>R3</strong> - 9m from a protruding log in a large log jam.\nCaution should be taken here not to step through a the false floor.</p>\n<p><strong>Jump</strong> - Immediately after Rappel 4 is a 2m jump into\na shallow pool.</p>\n<p><strong>R4</strong> - 20m on a natural anchor log jammed overhead.\nThe rappel is 2 small drops. These drops could be the problematic\nsection in higher lows. Both are potentially strong trap pools. The\nfirst drop should be rappelled CR to avoid the trap pool on CL. Climb\nout of the pool to the second drop which is rappelled on CL. The second\ndrop has a rope eating crack which jammed hard for one rappeller that\nthey got stuck in a loop for a short period of time. In higher flows,\nthese two drops may be bypassable with a high ledge on CL, but it will\nrequire a long multi-point handline to be traversed safely.</p>\n<p><strong>R5/jump</strong> - After a small downclimb/slide around a\ncorner, swim across the pool and climb out to a single bolt on CL. This\nclimb out will be challenging in higher flows because the majority of\nthe pool exits here. The waterfall is 7m in height. Steel wool is\nrecommended for cleaning the slippery rock face.</p>\n<p><strong>Slide</strong> - Sit on CL and slide the low angle but\npowerful 6m slide. The slide flushes you to the opposite wall, but\nexiting the pool requires climbing out in strong concentrated current.\nIn high flows, this could be extremely challenging. The pool below is a\nstrong eddy, and it will trap bags in lower flows (and people in higher\nflows).</p>\n<p><strong>R6</strong> - 11m off single bolt on CR. Slippery climb out\nof the pool to reach it. This waterfall is visible from the High Falls\nlookout, and it is a great water reference.</p>\n<p><strong>R7</strong> - Single bolt on CL for an 8m hanging rappel out\nof the flow.</p>\n<p><strong>R8</strong> - 25m in length from large tree root on CR. The\ndrop is two-tiered, separated by a long, deep pool. After setting the\nrope over both drops, team members can slide the fun 6m drop into the\npool and then swim across to CR to get on rappel for the 2nd drop.</p>\n<p><em>Directly after this second drop is a useful spot to eat &amp;\nplan for the main falls. At this point you're directly below the upper\nHigh Falls lookout. A scouting team rigged bolts at this lookout, making\nit possible to rappel down into the canyon from there. This makes it a\nuseful evacuation point (requiring either pre-planning to drop a rope\nhere as you shuttle up, or with the assistance of others from\nabove).</em></p>\n<p><strong>Siphon/Sieve Crossing</strong> - The water noticeably drops\nthrough a boulder choke and disappears. You must cross this section from\nCR to CL to get to the next rappel anchor. These sieves/siphons will be\na formidable challenge in higher flow since it will likely conceal its\nexit points. At low flows, crossing is straight-forward, with care. If\nneeded, there are large, living trees to anchor off on CR. After the\nfirst person crosses, you can set a guided rappel to either a jammed log\nor the bolts at Rappel 9.</p>\n<p><strong><u>High Falls</u></strong></p>\n<p><em>R9 through R12 should be linked to each other in a series of\nrebelays. Essentially this section is done as 4 consecutive\npitches.</em></p>\n<p>Pay attention while walking the false floor to get to R9.</p>\n<p><strong>R9</strong> (Pitch 1/4) - 35m. Pair of bolts DCL.\n(<strong>BOLTS NEED REPLACING DUE TO CORROSION.</strong> These\ngalvanized steel bolts were placed by a scouting team. Replacing them is\nsuggested, as they're showing signs of galvanic corrosion due to the\nenvironment and stainless steel hangers). Rappel 25m down and around the\ncorner out of sight to a small ledge. Traverse the ledge and under the\nroof for another 10m until reaching the bolts for R12. The total length\nof rope needed from anchor to anchor is 35m. DO NOT RAPPEL INTO THE\nLARGE POOL ABOVE HIGH FALLS.</p>\n<p><strong>R10</strong> (Pitch 2/4) - 12m. From 2 unlinked bolts on DCL\ndown the first sloping section of High Falls to reach the anchor at the\nedge of the main drop.</p>\n<p><strong>R11</strong> (Pitch 3/4) - 55m. From 2 unlinked bolts on DCL\nat an exposed and airy ledge. Begin the rappel straight down, over the\nsloping edge and out of sight of the anchor. You'll soon reach a large\ncrack (1.5 to 2m wide) that trends CL and downwards. Follow this crack\ndown until you see a 1m wide ledge just to the DCR of the crack. On this\nledge, you'll find the bolts for Rappel 14. DO NOT SKIP THE CRACK AND\nRAPPEL INTO THE LARGE POOL BECAUSE YOU WILL NOT FIND THE R14 BOLTS.</p>\n<p>NOTE: At least THREE groups have stuck their ropes when pulling from\nthe stance for R12. There are small ledges, horns, and rough spots in\nthe crack (more of a chimney) that can catch ropes when they are pulled\nstraight down. If you don't want this to happen, it is highly\nrecommended that you extend the pull for R11 to the pool at the bottom\nof R12 and pull from another 70' back, further down canyon. This means\nenough rope AND pull for R11 AND R12 at the same time. Even if pulling\npartially from the top of R12 before extending the rope, this means\n55m+25m (partially pulled)+~60m (rope down canyon) PLUS 45m+45m for a\ntotal of AT LEAST 230m (755') of rope. Hope you have some lighter pull\ncord.</p>\n<p><strong>R12</strong> (Pitch 4/4) - Time to enjoy the spray! R14 uses\n2 unlinked bolts at a 1m wide ledge for a 45m rappel. The bolts were\nplaced in a mossy face, so don't be surprised if the moss grows over the\nbolts after a long period of unuse. This rebelay location is spectacular\nbut quite unpleasant to hang out for long periods of time. The spray\nfrom the waterfall above is strong enough that you cannot look above\nyou.</p>\n<p><strong><u>Lower Canyon</u></strong></p>\n<p><strong>R13</strong> - After swimming across the pool at the base of\nHigh Falls, climb up CR to a single bolt. Rappel 15m along the ledge to\nthe next bolt.</p>\n<p><strong>R14</strong> - 14m from single bolt on CR.</p>\n<p><strong>Jump</strong> - 2m jump on CL.</p>\n<p><strong>R15</strong> - 20m from single bolt on CR. Traverse a\nslippery ledge for about 10m to reach the anchor. The traverse can be\nsomewhat protected/belayed from a single bolt placed on the outside of\nthe large boulder in the log pool.</p>\n<p><strong>Jump</strong> - 3m from the center of falls into a shallow\npool.</p>\n<p><strong>R16</strong> - 10m off single bolt CL.</p>\n<p><strong>R17</strong> - 8m off single bolt CL.</p>\n<p><strong>R18</strong> - 9m off single bolt HIGH CL (approximately 2.5m\nabove the canyon floor).</p>\n<p><strong>R19</strong> - 10m off single bolt on top of large boulder\nCL. This goes as a jump to the CR of the boulder into a deep slot, but\nthe launch is best accessed using a rope from the bolt.</p>\n<p><strong>R20</strong> - 9m from single bolt CL.</p>\n<p>Walk 200m or so to exit on CR.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>Walk down the creek until the wall on CR ends. Find a natural\nstaircase up and a short social trail through clear forest that leads\nback to the main trail. Walk the main trail 100m to the carpark.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><img src=\"rwl_en.png\" title=\"rwl_en.png\" alt=\"rwl_en.png\" /><a\nhref=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20210527212206/www.canyoneeringnorthwest.com/HighFalls/High_Falls.php\">CanyoneeringNorthwest.com\n(archive.org)</a> : High Falls Creek Prospect</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a\nhref=\"https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.10156267560892301&amp;type=3\">Facebook\nAlbum of First Decent of Lower Section from August 19, 2019</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n<p>High Falls was initially scouted by Chris Hood in 2003.
