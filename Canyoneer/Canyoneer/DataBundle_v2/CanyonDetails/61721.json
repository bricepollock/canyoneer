If you're looking for a training ground to improve your downclimbing, you've found it! Several of the rappels can be bypassed by downclimbing, and much of the travel between anchors is downclimbing.  This canyon is much lower flow than Thornton, and as such serves as an excellent back-up plan if you find Thornton is too high for your tastes.\n<\/p><p><br \/>\n<\/p><p>If you are looking for long vertical rappels or hate moss that blankets every horizontal and vertical surface in sight, this canyon is not for you.\n<\/p><p>Exit is possible through most of the canyon by climbing out either bank.\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>A car shuttle is strongly encouraged.  Park one set of vehicles at the confluence of the Sky and the Skagit, and drive the other set up Thornton Lakes Road until you find roadside parking at approximately 48.6379, -121.3318.
