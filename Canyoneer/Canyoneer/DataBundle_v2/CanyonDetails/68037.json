  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>Short but intense canyon. Only the upper part has been done for\nnow.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>From the car walk up Eggenstalden, from there you can enter the\ncanyon easily right underneath of the water capture (make sure it is out\nof function already)</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>Not much after the start, you can already see the Bridge from where\nyou can peak into the canyon. From there on it gets interesting. Best\npart is a 20m waterfall where you have to go through the water jet in\nthe middle.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>There is one more rappel after that Hammer, and then you should go\nout on the left side, and walk up through the steep forest.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n<p>Not sure how exactly the water captures are working there (further up\nin the valley there are some more), but in the canyon there is often\ngrass on the sides, so there shouldn't be too much danger of getting\ncaught in a flood wave.</p>\n"
