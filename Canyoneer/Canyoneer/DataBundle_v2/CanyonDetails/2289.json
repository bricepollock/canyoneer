Fork Owyhee River","description":"<div class=\"mw-content-ltr mw-parser-output\" lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><p>The Middle Fork of the Owyhee River is a non-technical river canyon, probably best done after May heading into summer when water levels drop. It's known for it's impressive array of spires and rock formations. A beautiful area that is rarely visited. For best scenery, this canyon is likely hiked from bottom-up.\n<\/p>\n<ul><li>Warning: In May 2024, the road to the rim just above Three Forks may lead one into a false sense of security. Abruptly below the rim, the road becomes pretty rough: high clearance, if not 4WD, required. The first switchback is also a bit nasty. Use caution. Do not attempt to drive down if you have a 2WD vehicle.<\/li><\/ul>\n<ul><li>Watch for rattlesnakes, particularly when hiking around in high vegetation.<\/li><\/ul>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>From the parking area, hike up the hill just north of the gate and obvious fence line, then turn south and head crosscountry to pick up the old road. This avoids issues with private property in the lower drainage. It's also a good idea to stay high in any event as some sections of the drainage are choked with thick impassable vegetation. Leave the road somewhere around 42.52701, -117.14114 and make your way cross-country in easy open terrain to eventually drop into the drainage around 42.51507, -117.14078. Continue upstream until you reach the Guardian Pillars which mark the entrance to the Middle Fork. Depending on conditions you may need or want to suit up before then. Sometimes hiking in the creek is the best way to make forward progress.\n<\/p>\n<style data-mw-deduplicate=\"TemplateStyles:r1062633282\">@media all and (max-width:720px){.mw-parser-output .content .thumb>div:not(.thumbinner){display:flex;justify-content:center;flex-wrap:wrap;align-content:flex-start;flex-direction:column}}body.skin-vector .mw-parser-output div.thumb>div:not(.thumbinner){font-size:94%;text-align:center;overflow:hidden;min-width:100px}body.skin-minerva .mw-parser-output div.thumb>div:not(.thumbinner){margin:0 auto;max-width:100%!important}<\/style> \n<div class=\"thumb tright\">\n<div style=\"display:table;\">\n<span class=\"mw-default-size\" typeof=\"mw:Error mw:File\/Frameless\">\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Continue upstream wherever is easiest, navigating your way around obstacles. You'll need to cross the creek numerous times, wade pools, skirt rapids, climb over\/around giant boulders, etc. There are a number of places requiring swimming where water spans wall-to-wall in the chasm. The going can be slow. Don't forget to look up occasionally, as huge cliff walls and numerous spires soar skyward. (In high flow, it might not be feasible to fight the current going upstream; some areas it could be dangerous.)\n<\/p>\n<link rel=\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\" href=\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1062633282\"> \n<div class=\"thumb tright\">\n<div style=\"display:table;\">\n<span class=\"mw-default-size\" typeof=\"mw:Error mw:File\/Frameless\">\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<link rel=\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\" href=\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1062633282\"> \n<div class=\"thumb tright\">\n<div style=\"display:table;\">\n<span class=\"mw-default-size\" typeof=\"mw:Error mw:File\/Frameless\">\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>Eventually, reach the confluence of Pole Creek. Pole Creek has a different character than the Middle Fork proper. Cross a deep pool and scramble out to continue up through a Rhyolite narrows to reach a giant boulder garden seeming to block further progress. This may be a good place to turn around.\n<\/p><p>Back at the confluence continue upstream. Eventually, enter a cliff-walled grotto with a 15ft waterfall. A mostly-dry tributary (in May 2024) choked with boulders enters from the west. The falls can be bypassed by backtracking downstream 100ft and scrambling out climber's left. \n<\/p>\n<link rel=\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\" href=\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1062633282\"> \n<div class=\"thumb tright\">\n<div style=\"display:table;\">\n<span class=\"mw-default-size\" typeof=\"mw:Error mw:File\/Frameless\">\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>Continuing upstream, round a giant S-bend with more terrific rock formations about and, on the far side, notice a grassy slope leading up to an obvious saddle. This is the exit. Make your way up cow paths to saddle which is a rise between the Middle Fork and the previously named dry tributary. Take a look around here to note the innumerable rock spires surrounding you on all sides. Spire-land is an impressive sight.\n<\/p>\n<link rel=\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\" href=\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1062633282\"> \n<div class=\"thumb tright\">\n<div style=\"display:table;\">\n<span class=\"mw-default-size\" typeof=\"mw:Error mw:File\/Frameless\">\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<link rel=\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\" href=\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1062633282\"> \n<div class=\"thumb tright\">\n<div style=\"display:table;\">\n<span class=\"mw-default-size\" typeof=\"mw:Error mw:File\/Frameless\">\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<link rel=\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\" href=\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1062633282\"> \n<div class=\"thumb tright\">\n<div style=\"display:table;\">\n<span class=\"mw-default-size\" typeof=\"mw:Error mw:File\/Frameless\">\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>Contour west along the slopes (you may need to climb up a bit) until you spot a grassy gulley on the north side of the trib which leads all the way up to the rim.

You made it!\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Up on the mesa, head roughly northwest along the top of the ridge. The hiking is open and easy.
