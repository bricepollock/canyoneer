  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>Spring-fed creek with crystal clear water flowing through a sandstone\nslot with walls up to 100 feet.</p>\n<p>One rappel off a large tire: drop is 40 feet but anchor is another 10\nfeet back. If flash flood removes anchor there should be other anchor\nmaterial available. One 120 foot rope is recommended. One downclimb\nabout 10 feet which can be stemmed over. Narrows section is narrow\nenough to stem / bridge for about 200 feet. Pools under waist depth as\nof May 2023.</p>\n<p>Very scenic. A great way to cool off the feet, clean off your shoes,\nropes and gear on the way home from a day or days in Northwash or\nTicaboo.</p>\n<p>High clearance vehicle needed, 4x4 useful (or required) depending on\nseason / road conditions. Road may be impassable after heavy rains or in\nearly spring as there are numerous creek crossings.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>Follow the gravel road to the bottom of Crescent Creek from the\ntrailhead parking. Once in the canyon, continue downstream. You will\npass Lecleed Spring on DCL, and the water flow in the creek will\nincrease. From this point, the steam will be mostly ankle-deep deep,\nwith some knee-deep sections towards the canyon's end.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>After exiting the canyon, scramble up a loose rock field to the old\nmining road above. Then follow the road to the left, and it will\nintersect the main gravel road in a few minutes. Follow that road back\nto your car.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><img src=\"rwl_en.png\" title=\"rwl_en.png\" alt=\"rwl_en.png\" /><a\nhref=\"http://roadtripryan.com/go/t/utah/north-wash/conundrum\">RoadTripRyan.com</a>\n: Conundrum Canyon</li>\n<li><img src=\"rwl_en.png\" title=\"rwl_en.png\" alt=\"rwl_en.png\" /><a\nhref=\"http://ropewiki.com/User:Super_Amazing_Map?id=Crescent_Creek__-_North_Wash\">Super\nAmazing Map</a> : Crescent Creek aka Conundrum Canyon</li>\n<li><img src=\"rwl_en.png\" title=\"rwl_en.png\" alt=\"rwl_en.png\" /><a\nhref=\"http://climb-utah.com/Powell/crescent.htm\">Climb-Utah.com</a> :\nCrescent Creek - Henry Mountains</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><img src=\"rwl_en.png\" title=\"rwl_en.png\" alt=\"rwl_en.png\" /><a\nhref=\"http://candition.com/canyons/conundrum-canyon-north-wash\">Candition.com</a>\n:</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n",
