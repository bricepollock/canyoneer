  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>One big waterfall, with an often dry boulderbed below. The main\nabseil is worth the trek in. Can be done as a single rappel, from good\nbolts at the top, with a long enough rope. Otherwise, there is a rebelay\non the river right midway down. Rope retrieval at the rebelay can be\nproblematic as there are many flakes on where the rope can snag. Rebelay\nanchors (as of Summer 2020) were old pitons.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>Take the main Cheonbuldang trail. After the Biseondae trail junction\n(just after the ranger hut), look for the next stream that enters the\nmain valley. The easiest approach is to climb up Tomakgol. Once below\nHyeongjae Falls, look to the river right. It is possible to climb up the\nridge here. Exposed scrambling (easy climbing). There are a few slings\nleft along the way. Rock is chossy.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<p>You need permits to climb in Seoraksan National Park. You are not\nsupposed to enter the water. Use discretion (though bloggers and\ninstagrammers regularly post about trips)</p>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<p><a\nhref=\"https://blog.daum.net/honbul-/1464\">https://blog.daum.net/honbul-/1464</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n"
