The main abseil is worth the trek in. \nCan be done as a single rappel, from good bolts at the top, with a long enough rope. Otherwise, there is a rebelay on the river right midway down. Rope retrieval at the rebelay can be problematic as there are many flakes on where the rope can snag. Rebelay anchors (as of Summer 2020) were old pitons.\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Take the main Cheonbuldang trail.\nAfter the Biseondae trail junction (just after the ranger hut), look for the next stream that enters the main valley. \nThe easiest approach is to climb up Tomakgol. Once below Hyeongjae Falls, look to the river right. It is possible to climb up the ridge here. Exposed scrambling (easy climbing). There are a few slings left along the way.
