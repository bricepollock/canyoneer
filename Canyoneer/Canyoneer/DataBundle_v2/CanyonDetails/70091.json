The highlight of this route is Kane Falls, a massive waterfall formed where the creek pinches and then shoots down a 232' drop into a beautiful pool surrounded by giant house-sized boulders. It's one of those special places in this world that makes you feel small. Although a short canyon, the other rappels are fun and wet. Worth pairing with Able Creek for a fun full day of canyoning.\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>From Cougar, continue east on WA-503.
