  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p><strong>THIS CANYON PAGE IS A DUPLICATE OF: <a\nhref=\"https://ropewiki.com/Blue_Pool_Wash\">https://ropewiki.com/Blue_Pool_Wash</a></strong></p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>Right off of Highway 89. Headed towards Kanab/Utah, the parking area\nis to the left, immediately before the bridge, down a very short dirt\nroad (between mile marker 3 and4).</p>\n<p>Begin a down climb into the canyon just upstream from the bridge,\npretty much right at the parking area. Some say you can also enter on\nthe opposite side of the bridge, may depend on water levels</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>Follow the slot canyon with a couple downclwimbs before reaching\nrap1.</p>\n<p>Rap 1: 20f. From a boulder</p>\n<p>Rap 2: 20f. Novelty anchor off of an old car engine. However there is\na bolted anchor LDC, above eye height on the sloping rock.</p>\n<p>Rap 3: 50f. Bolted. Be mindful of rope pull. A crack that is\ndefinitely a rope eater.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>Shortly after the last rappel, the canyon quickly begins to open up\nagain. A sandy walk. Once the right side wall begins to slope, look for\ncairns to indicate the way out. Very sloped rock with a couple of class\n4 moves closer to the top. Once at the top, some cross country back\ntowards to road and your car. There is a barbed wire fence near the road\nyou will need to navigate past (or perhaps find the opening?)</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><img src=\"rwl_en.png\" title=\"rwl_en.png\" alt=\"rwl_en.png\" /><a\nhref=\"http://summitpost.org/blue-pools-slot-canyon/876033\">SummitPost.org</a>\n: Blue Pools Slot Canyon</li>\n<li><img src=\"rwl_en.png\" title=\"rwl_en.png\" alt=\"rwl_en.png\" /><a\nhref=\"http://toddshikingguide.com/Hikes/Arizona/Misc/Misc24.htm\">ToddsHikingGuide.com</a>\n: Blue Pools Slot Canyon</li>\n<li><img src=\"rwl_en.png\" title=\"rwl_en.png\" alt=\"rwl_en.png\" />[ <a\nhref=\"https://www.roadtripryan.com/go/t/utah/powell/blue-pool-wash\">https://www.roadtripryan.com/go/t/utah/powell/blue-pool-wash</a>]\n: Blue Pools Slot Canyon</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a\nhref=\"http://adamhaydock.blogspot.com/2020/06/blue-pools-wash-3a1-arizona.html\">EVEN\nFURTHER_BLUE POOLS</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<p><a\nhref=\"https://adamhaydock.blogspot.com/2020/06/blue-pools-wash-3a1-arizona.html\">EVEN\nFURTHER BLUE POOLS</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"background_1\">Background</h2>\n",
