It has the added bonus of sunshine in the lower part. The rigging is less technical than other canyons on the island.\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Just east of Seixal, turn up ER221, which is marked as Chão da Ribeira. Like most places in Madeira, the road is very steep and winding. Continue all the way to Chão da Ribeira and park in a lot outside a farm. (Note this is the main exit parking for all of the Seixal tributary canyons). From the parking lot, follow the road along the river, which becomes trail. The trail undulates up and down hill until eventually terminating at a “Lombo Barbinhos” sign on the river’s edge, pointing you to cross the river. The Verada do Lombo Barbinhos starts on the other side of the river, about 50m upriver from the crossing. You can cross at the sign, and follow social trails upriver until you find the actual trail, or you can cross slightly upriver to the trail. Either way, plan to get wet on the crossing.\n<\/p><p>Verada do Lomb Barbinhos is nearly entirely stairs - its a great workout! Climb until you reach the Levada do Seixal, then turn right. This Levada trail is rough compared to others, narrow with a lot of exposure. You will go through one long tunnel on the approach. The entrance to the tunnel can be intimidating, as you cross strong current coming from the Hortela falls into the Levada. However, once crossing it, the tunnel is easy traveling compared to some other tunnels on the island. Headlamp required! The canyon starts immediately after exiting the tunnel.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>The canyon descent is pretty straight forward. There are a few awkward (possibly nuisance) rappels in the beginning, but once you arrive at the grotto, it’s beautiful! The rest of the canyon is just pure fun. Rather than listing rappels here, go to the camadeira website below and download the canyon topo. It has all the info you need!\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>The exit is super straight forward. Follow the creek until you reach the Lombo Barbinhos crossing, where you crossed earlier that day, and head back on the trail you took from your cars.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Red_tape\">Red tape<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Beta_sites\">Beta sites<\/h2><\/div>\n<ul><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http:\/\/descente-canyon.com\/canyoning\/canyon-description\/22145\">Descente-Canyon.com<\/a> &#160;: Seixal (inférieur)<\/li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http:\/\/canyoning.camadeira.com\/canyons\/ribeira-do-seixal-inferior\">CaMadeira.com<\/a> &#160;: Ribeira do Seixal (inferior)<\/li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http:\/\/barrancoscanarios.com\/barrancos\/madeira\/ribeira-seixal\">BarrancosCanarios.com<\/a> &#160;: Ribeira do Seixal Inferior<\/li><\/ul>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media<\/h2><\/div>\n<ul><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http:\/\/wikiloc.com\/wikiloc\/view.do?id=2810338\">Wikiloc.com<\/a> &#160;: Seixal Inferior<\/li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http:\/\/wikiloc.com\/wikiloc\/view.do?id=18198615\">Wikiloc.com<\/a> &#160;: Seixal inferior<\/li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http:\/\/wikiloc.com\/wikiloc\/view.do?id=9583099\">Wikiloc.com<\/a> &#160;: Ribeira do Seixal<\/li><\/ul>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Background\">Background<\/h2><\/div>\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nParsed by mw‐api‐ext.codfw.main‐6779cc57fc‐dvkjz\nCached time: 20240914191817\nCache expiry: 2592000\nReduced expiry: false\nComplications: [show‐toc]\nCPU time usage: 0.008 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.009 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 21\/1000000\nPost‐expand include size: 0\/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 0\/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 2\/100\nExpensive parser function count: 0\/500\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0\/20\nUnstrip post‐expand size: 0\/5000000 bytes\nNumber of Wikibase entities loaded: 0\/400\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%    0.000      1 -total\n-->\n<\/div>"}
