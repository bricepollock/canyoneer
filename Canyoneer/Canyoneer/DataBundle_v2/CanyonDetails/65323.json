{"timeRating":"III","months":["Jan","Feb","Mar","Apr","May"],"shuttleSeconds":null,"description":"<div class=\"mw-content-ltr mw-parser-output\" lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><p>Arco Del Tiempo is a spectacular chasm carved through the hillside by the Rio de la Venta. The largest natural arch in the world, Arco del Tiempo is a swim surrounded by breathtakingly high walls and verdant vegetation. It can be reached by raft or boat on a river expedition, by hiking as a day trip, or as an overnight camping trip. It's not really a canyon, but when approached by land has one mandatory rappel to reach the very bottom (and a mandatory rope ascent to get back out).\n<\/p><p>The trip is offered as a guided trip by many tour companies in the area (generally with an overnight stay camping near the river). An overnight is not necessary, but could be fun during the dry season if you wish to take your time. You do not need to go through a tour company to do this trip, but you will need to hire a local guide (more details below).\n<\/p><p>An overland trip to Arco del Tiempo is best during the dry season (Jan-May) but can be done all year if the weather permits. However if the water is too high in the river, you may not be able to do the final rappel into the river to explore the arch.\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Drive to the small town of General Cárdenas. GPS Coords 16.898249517517545, -93.72889005634175 or Google maps to \"Cabañas Arco del Tiempo\" will take you to a small cluster of cabins and an outdoor restaurant. If no one is there, find the nearest person in town (there was a small house right at the gate where we found someone). \n<\/p><p>You will need to arrange a local guide here (see red tape below), so don't plan on driving in at 7am and starting the canyon immediately; stay in town the night before if you're planning on a day trip. The quality of the guides can vary. \n<\/p><p>The cabanas are in good condition (and approx 350-400 pesos\/night in 2021); for an additional 50 pesos\/night one even has a king-sized bed (a luxury in Mexico). There is running water (not hot), but the water pressure isn't always great. They will also let you setup camp if you'd prefer. \n<\/p><p><br \/>\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading3\"><h3 id=\"The_Hike\">The Hike<\/h3><\/div>\n<p>You can hike from General Cárdenas, however it's recommended you drive the first 2 miles, which are on a dirt road. This can be done in a passenger vehicle, but there may be a water crossing required, so high clearance is preferable. \n<\/p><p>You'll park at the end of the road and take a well trodden path through the jungle. It meanders up and down for 2 miles, before descending 1200 feet in approx 1.5 miles. There are often hand lines rigged on particularly steep or slippery sections. You'll begin to hear the river in the distance and will end on an 80' cliff with a spectacular view of the Arch above the river.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Down climb with the aid of fixed hand lines to a ledge big enough for 4 people, where you can rig a rappel of ~80' from fixed bolts. There will likely be rope protectors stashed there that you can use (as the lip is a bit sharp). \n<\/p><p>Rappel down, landing in the water (which could be between ankle and waist deep depending on recent conditions). Leave your rope in place. From here take your time exploring. There's a large rock or sandbar where you could eat lunch. You can swim pretty far up river into the chasm. There are a few places where you can climb up and jump back into the river.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<p><b>You must ascend out your rappel line.<\/b> The first half of the ascent is free hanging and fairly awkward. The second half is on vertical wall with some foot holds along the way. Make sure to leave enough time for all in your party to ascend back out; it will likely take at least 15 minutes each.\n<\/p><p>Hike back out the trail you came in on. What seemed like a moderate approach hike will be a lot less fun when you're doing 1300' of elevation gain in the heat and what is likely 100% humidity.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Red_tape\">Red tape<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>To hike to Arco del Tiempo you must take a local guide from General Cárdenas. As of June 2021 we were charged 250 pesos ( tip) for a guide for the day (shared cost) and 400 each for an entrance fee and \"wall fee.\" We were told we were given 50% off the latter as we brought and carried all of our own equipment (assume 800 pesos if you want them to provide equipment and setup the rappel). Even the tour companies that arrange trips here must take a local guide form General Cárdenas. \n<\/p><p>While not required, it's highly recommended that you order food from the restaurant while you're in town as it helps sustain the community (you can arrange for beers and a hot meal to be waiting for you, prepared by the locals, when you get out of the hike! They will also cook you breakfast in the morning if you stay overnight.) \n<\/p><p>We were warned that during the rainy season the venomous snakes in the area are more likely to be in or near the river. Make sure to ask your guide about this and stay safe if you're there between Jun-Dec.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Beta_sites\">Beta sites<\/h2><\/div>\n<ul><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external free\" href=\"https:\/\/www.espiritu-libre.com\/day-356-arco-del-tiempo\">https:\/\/www.espiritu-libre.com\/day-356-arco-del-tiempo<\/a> (includes a downloadable gps track, though as mentioned above you will still need to hire a guide)<\/li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external free\" href=\"https:\/\/www.sinpostal.com\/arcodeltiempo\/\">https:\/\/www.sinpostal.com\/arcodeltiempo\/<\/a><\/li><\/ul>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>==Back\n<\/p>\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nParsed by mw‐api‐ext.codfw.main‐6779cc57fc‐mrcjn\nCached time: 20240914192030\nCache expiry: 2592000\nReduced expiry: false\nComplications: [show‐toc]\nCPU time usage: 0.005 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.006 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 21\/1000000\nPost‐expand include size: 0\/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 0\/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 2\/100\nExpensive parser function count: 0\/500\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0\/20\nUnstrip post‐expand size: 0\/5000000 bytes\nNumber of Wikibase entities loaded: 0\/400\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%    0.000      1 -total\n-->\n<\/div><div class=\"mw-content-ltr mw-parser-output\" lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><p>ground==\n<\/p>\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nParsed by mw‐api‐ext.codfw.main‐6779cc57fc‐mrbkb\nCached time: 20240914192031\nCache expiry: 2592000\nReduced expiry: false\nComplications: []\nCPU time usage: 0.002 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.002 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 1\/1000000\nPost‐expand include size: 0\/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 0\/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 1\/100\nExpensive parser function count: 0\/500\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0\/20\nUnstrip post‐expand size: 0\/5000000 bytes\nNumber of Wikibase entities loaded: 0\/400\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%    0.000      1 -total\n-->\n<\/div>","vehicle":"High Clearance","rappelLongestMeters":24.38,"version":"df330fb8d41e770f69903895c8977430a5db77692070958c1e10d1d371f58738","permit":"No","name":"Arco del Tiempo","quality":5,"technicalRating":3,"longitude":-93.7261,"url":"https:\/\/ropewiki.com\/Arco_del_Tiempo","waterRating":"B","riskRating":null,"rappelCountMin":1,"id":65323,"geojson":null,"latitude":16.9039,"rappelCountMax":1}
