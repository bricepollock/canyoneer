  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>A descent through a short, but beautiful narrows on Herman Creek.\nIt's like a mini-version of its more impressive cousin, <a\nhref=\"Eagle_Creek\" title=\"wikilink\">Eagle Creek</a> to the west. While\nthe narrows are cool to visit, the pay-to-play on this one is a bit\nhigh. You'll probably spend more time hiking and bushwhacking than in\nthe creek.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>This area was overrun by the 2017 Eagle Creek fire. Expect lots of\nloose rock and woody debris underfoot on the entrance tributary and\nexit.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Once you rappel into the narrows, escape opportunities are limited.\nThis section could be dangerous in high water. Hydraulics and other\nswiftwater hazards may be present. For folks unfamiliar with swiftwater\ntechniques, it's probably best visited in late summer.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Always scout pools first before jumping. Jumping is a leading cause\nof canyon injury (e.g. broken ankles and legs).</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Dedicated canyon obsessives could probably descend both the Herman\nCreek narrows and Camp Creek in a single day.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>Drive up through the Herman Creek campground and continue bearing\nright at all junctions to find the trailhead. (The road into the\ncampground is closed/gated in the winter season. If the gate is closed,\njust park on Frontage Rd adjacent to the gate. It's a 5min hike up to\nthe trailhead.)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Parking down on Frontage Road may be preferred as this trailhead is\nknown for car break-ins. Do not leave any valuables or things that look\npotentially valuable in your car.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Bring a map as there are several trail junctions.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Follow trail 406, passing Camp Creek at ~2.5mi. At 2.9mi reach a\nminor drainage. Beware poison oak along the trail. Start your descent\ndown this small, brushy creek until you reach the first obstacle after a\nfew minutes. There is a lot of loose rocks and woody debris in the creek\npost-fire.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p><strong>Minor unnamed tributary</strong></p>\n<p>There was barely any water in this creek in Sept 2021. Might be more\nfun earlier in the season. (There's also another sizeable falls\nimmediately upstream of the trail that we did not have time to\ninvestigate.)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>10ft sloping drop. Downclimb or rappel.</li>\n<li>R0: 80ft from tree DCL.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A few minutes below R0 you'll enter Herman Creek. It may be possible\n(?) to exit up the steep hillside DCL to the trail just before you drop\nin. This might be a good escape route if Herman Creek is running too\nhigh.</p>\n<p><strong>Herman Creek Narrows</strong></p>\n<p>There are some nice ledges just downstream DCR which is a good place\nto suit up if you haven't done so already. The next rappel (into the\nnarrows) comes immediately.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>R1: 45ft from single bolt DCR. The rappel is two-stage with a nice\nplatform below where you can set the length. You may want to extend the\npull side or use a longer rope so you can pull from a better location on\nthe far side of the pool. (This drop might be a good jump from a large\nledge DCR or a log spanning the pool.)</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Swim the punchbowl to a short downclimb (DCL) to enter the narrows\nproper.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This is a beautiful water-filled corridor with a little swimming\nalong the way. There are a couple of short downclimbs along the way, but\nno substantial obstacles in lower water. Take your time as the narrows\nare short and sweet.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>R2: 15ft from log DCL. Other options: jump (?) or scoot your way\nacross a big log.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Just ahead Camp Creek enters DCR with a couple nice waterfalls\nvisible. Ahead, Herman Creek passes through one last set of narrows,\nthen opens out.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>From Camp Creek, continue down Herman Creek about five minutes until\nit's easy to exit up the bank DCR. If it's not easy, you haven't gone\nfar enough. Climb up onto a relatively flat forested bench. This is a\ngood place to de-wetsuit. (This is the same exit as Camp Creek.)</p>\n<p>From here, the exit back up to the trail is an off-trail bushwhack.\nIt takes, perhaps, 30min. Don't attempt to go directly uphill back to\nthe trail per cliffs. The easiest route is follow the bench northwards\nstaying about the same elevation until you reach a small crest just\nbefore the next unnamed tributary creek to the north. From here turn\nright and make your way up a short distance to the trail. This is the\nbest route out with minimal elevation gain, but the area is full of\nbriars that have grown up post-fire, so you'll need to thread your way\nthrough. Try to avoid gaining the elevation too early.</p>\n<p>Once back on the trail, return the way you came. It's a bit over 2mi\nback to the trailhead.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<p>A Northwest Forest Pass is required to park at the Herman Creek\ntrailhead. You do not need one if you park down on Frontage Road.</p>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n<p>First descended by Kevin Clark, Lisa Ripps, and Alex Danielson in\nSept 2021.
