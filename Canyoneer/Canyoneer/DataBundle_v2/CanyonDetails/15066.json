You can rappel this, or down climb instead on the right.  From the bottom take the trail on your right which winds back and forth across the creek and then heads 10 feet up a drainage on the left. Immediately the trail heads up and to the right, with landlines installed. At the top you will begin an incredibly steep and muddy, slippery trail that descends through a cow field and some bananas to your car. At the car there is a hose for washing, which you will need because of all the smelly mud you just went through.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Red_tape\">Red tape<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>On the exit trail there are some no trespassing signs that steer you to the left.
