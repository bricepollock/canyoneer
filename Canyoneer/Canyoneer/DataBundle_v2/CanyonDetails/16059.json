There are 4 notable rappels to 160-feet and 4 nuisance rappels. There is one huge jumping pool with perches up to 20 feet high, which adds a lot to an otherwise forgettable canyon considering the other options on the island.\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>It is very important to take the right path to the exit vehicle or this could be the worst exit of your life. A couple hundred feet down creek from the final rappel is a cairn marker. Take this left BUT DO NOT CLIMB UP THE HILLSIDE as you would expect a cairn to indicate. Instead go left and continue down and you will run into the main creek again but continue down more just on the left of the creek. Eventually you will hit an old rocky road that comes to a bridge and soon after to the paved road just above the industrial site.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Red_tape\">Red tape<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Beta_sites\">Beta sites<\/h2><\/div>\n<ul><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http:\/\/descente-canyon.com\/canyoning\/canyon-description\/21618\">Descente-Canyon.com<\/a> &#160;: Cabo<\/li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http:\/\/ropewiki.com\/User:Azores_Canyoning_Book?id=Cabo_#37.\">Azores Canyoning Book by Desnivel<\/a><\/li><\/ul>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Background\">Background<\/h2><\/div>\n\n\n<\/div>","rappelCountMin":8,"id":16059,"geojson":{"features":[{"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[[-31.1776,39.4349,0]]},"type":"Feature","properties":{"name":"Start"}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"coordinates":[[-31.166046,39.438371,0]],"type":"Point"},"properties":{"name":"End"}},{"geometry":{"type":"LineString","coordinates":[[-31.177597,39.43483,0],[-31.177491,39.434914,0],[-31.177418,39.434972,0],[-31.177296,39.43505,0],[-31.177184,39.435085,0],[-31.177115,39.435103,0],[-31.177017,39.43509,0],[-31.176946,39.435081,0],[-31.176897,39.435057,0],[-31.176821,39.435064,0],[-31.176764,39.435082,0],[-31.176712,39.435098,0],[-31.17663,39.435097,0],[-31.176564,39.435096,0],[-31.176492,39.435108,0],[-31.17644,39.435132,0],[-31.176407,39.43517,0],[-31.176265,39.435238,0],[-31.176196,39.43526,0],[-31.176043,39.435278,0],[-31.175934,39.435305,0],[-31.17582,39.435334,0],[-31.175713,39.43538,0],[-31.175589,39.435424,0],[-31.175527,39.435453,0],[-31.17546,39.435485,0],[-31.175385,39.435508,0],[-31.175289,39.435507,0],[-31.175175,39.435467,0],[-31.175055,39.435433,0],[-31.17494,39.4354,0],[-31.174842,39.435389,0],[-31.174717,39.435378,0],[-31.17456,39.435385,0],[-31.174431,39.435415,0],[-31.174336,39.435479,0],[-31.174253,39.435561,0],[-31.174182,39.435634,0],[-31.17404,39.435703,0],[-31.173869,39.435734,0],[-31.173765,39.435756,0],[-31.173622,39.435776,0],[-31.173466,39.435808,0],[-31.17332,39.435842,0],[-31.173157,39.435904,0],[-31.173032,39.435954,0],[-31.172886,39.436015,0],[-31.172766,39.436087,0],[-31.172574,39.436172,0],[-31.172457,39.43621,0],[-31.172342,39.436216,0],[-31.172215,39.436252,0],[-31.172109,39.436271,0],[-31.171964,39.436273,0],[-31.171804,39.43627,0],[-31.171703,39.436294,0],[-31.171574,39.436341,0],[-31.171504,39.43638,0],[-31.171421,39.436432,0],[-31.171356,39.436485,0],[-31.171293,39.436543,0],[-31.171212,39.436614,0],[-31.171169,39.436676,0],[-31.171078,39.436682,0],[-31.170981,39.436694,0],[-31.170882,39.436746,0],[-31.170796,39.436809,0],[-31.170733,39.436875,0],[-31.170722,39.436946,0],[-31.170698,39.437002,0],[-31.170606,39.437125,0],[-31.170527,39.437223,0],[-31.170456,39.437306,0],[-31.170415,39.437372,0],[-31.170362,39.437428,0],[-31.170248,39.437472,0],[-31.170139,39.437505,0],[-31.16998,39.437548,0],[-31.169869,39.437579,0],[-31.16977,39.437608,0],[-31.169672,39.437661,0],[-31.169614,39.437723,0],[-31.169561,39.437785,0],[-31.169476,39.437851,0],[-31.169373,39.437905,0],[-31.169164,39.437897,0],[-31.169043,39.43784,0],[-31.168951,39.437778,0],[-31.168908,39.437728,0],[-31.168859,39.437633,0],[-31.168711,39.437469,0],[-31.168597,39.437406,0],[-31.168504,39.437389,0],[-31.168377,39.437439,0],[-31.168295,39.437493,0],[-31.168168,39.437531,0],[-31.16802,39.43754,0],[-31.1679,39.437534,0],[-31.167793,39.437475,0],[-31.167673,39.437388,0],[-31.167547,39.437321,0],[-31.167435,39.437254,0],[-31.167294,39.437204,0],[-31.167105,39.437188,0],[-31.166861,39.437193,0],[-31.166712,39.437223,0],[-31.166609,39.437275,0],[-31.16652,39.437352,0],[-31.166434,39.437448,0],[-31.166381,39.437554,0],[-31.166372,39.4377,0],[-31.166392,39.43784,0],[-31.166426,39.437934,0],[-31.166409,39.438059,0],[-31.166314,39.438176,0],[-31.16625,39.438246,0],[-31.166135,39.438333,0],[-31.166046,39.438371,0]]},"properties":{"name":"Descent","stroke":"#FF0000"},"type":"Feature"}],"type":"FeatureCollection"},"url":"https:\/\/ropewiki.com\/Cabo_(Flores)","name":"Cabo (Flores)","rappelLongestMeters":50,"shuttleSeconds":null,"timeRating":"III"}
