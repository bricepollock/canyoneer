  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>This is a quick and easy rappel that can be done as a training site\non a popular hiking trail that leads to multiple other canyons and\npeaks. Be courteous to bicycles and hikers. If you will be here for an\nextended time on a weekend, set up two raps: a short 10-20 footer to the\nplateau below, and a longer 60-70 footer for the loitering, then clear\nthe trail for traffic.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>Park at the unofficial condor peak trail lot just a few hundred yards\nbeyond Vogel Flat Road. A short 0.2 mile hike to the first trickle\ncreek, which is very obvious. You can still see the road from the point\nwhere you first hear the water. The opposite dry gully can also be\nrappelled to the same completion point.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>Multiple trees and bushes are available to drop from different\nlocations. There is some healthy poison oak, as with most Big T\ncanyons.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>Just walk back to the road along the water and exit canyon right by\nthe culvert.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<p>No</p>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n<p>First descent by Jane Fontana and Mark Fitzsimmons on April 17,\n2023.</p>\n",
