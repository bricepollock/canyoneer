{"description":"<div class=\"mw-content-ltr mw-parser-output\" lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><p>This is a quick and easy rappel that can be done as a training site on a popular hiking trail that leads to multiple other canyons and peaks. Be courteous to bicycles and hikers. If you will be here for an extended time on a weekend, set up two raps: a short 10-20 footer to the plateau below, and a longer 60-70 footer for the loitering, then clear the trail for traffic.\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Park at the unofficial condor peak trail lot just a few hundred yards beyond Vogel Flat Road. A short 0.2 mile hike to the first trickle creek, which is very obvious. You can still see the road from the point where you first hear the water. The opposite dry gully can also be rappelled to the same completion point.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Multiple trees and bushes are available to drop from different locations.
