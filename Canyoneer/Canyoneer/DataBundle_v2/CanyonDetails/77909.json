{"description":"<div class=\"mw-content-ltr mw-parser-output\" lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><p>This is a quick and easy rappel that can be done as a training site on a popular hiking trail that leads to multiple other canyons and peaks. Be courteous to bicycles and hikers. If you will be here for an extended time on a weekend, set up two raps: a short 10-20 footer to the plateau below, and a longer 60-70 footer for the loitering, then clear the trail for traffic.\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Park at the unofficial condor peak trail lot just a few hundred yards beyond Vogel Flat Road. A short 0.2 mile hike to the first trickle creek, which is very obvious. You can still see the road from the point where you first hear the water.
