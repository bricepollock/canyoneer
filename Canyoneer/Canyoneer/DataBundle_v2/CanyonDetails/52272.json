  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>Wildcat Canyon is arguably the best canyon on the South side of the\nNF American. The West Fork has a nice gorge, followed by a couple good\nrappels down big waterfalls, and enters the lower section, with jumps,\nslides, and a short slotted gorge. We descended it to a creek where we\nexited up to Walker Mine, and out the associated trail.</p>\n<p>It's likely also possible to exit down to the river, and make your\nway 1.5 miles downstream to exit via the Sailor Canyon trail. This would\nallow you to complete a last few rappels or jumps, and also cut down a\nbit on your elevation gain on the way out.</p>\n<p>Also, the East Fork of Wildcat looks like it's probably pretty cool,\nand has many tightly spaced, large drops.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>Drive out forest divide road, and spot a car here: 39.1744,\n-120.4707. Then continue another mile and a half and park here: 39.1724,\n-120.4511. Hike north, and head down the ridge. There is a sort of trail\nthat you can follow, but you will want probably a GPS with you, as once\nyou follow the ridge down and it gets steep, the trail mostly\ndisappears, and it's easy to veer off too far left. You're aiming for\nPlacer Queen Mine here: 39.1844, -120.4582</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>From that point you can climb into the creek and start downstream. It\nremains scenic, though non-technical, and you can stay dry for the next\nmile or so. Eventually you will find a fun little slide, just below a\nsmall tributary coming in from the right. From here the canyon becomes\nfun, with downclimbs, and some short jumps through a pretty gorge. Then\nyou'll come up to the biggest rappel (from a tree way up to the left),\nand more rappels down to the confluence with the East Fork.</p>\n<p>The canyon below here is largely nontechnical, with downclimbs and\njumps. There are a couple exceptions. One is a short tight gorge, that\nthe canyon drops surprisingly into after a bend. You rappel into it, and\nthen have a couple downclimbs to deal with. This section could become\ndangerous at higher flows, although you could likely bypass it with some\nsubstantial effort?</p>\n<p>More fun canyon lies downstream of here. If you are exiting at walker\nmine, keep an eye out for the significant tributary on the left (here:\n39.2082, -120.4698). You come to it just after a fun drop where you can\ntraverse right on a ledge, and then jump ~15 feet, or probably also take\nit as a steep 10 foot slide. The exit is that creek on the left.</p>\n<p>If you still have energy, you can drop your packs, and continue\ndownstream for more fun jumps and slide. At the biggest jump of ~25\nfeet, you can set a rope on the tree to the right as a hand line to get\nback up when you return for the exit. When you get above the last few\nlarger drops of Wildcat, turn around and climb back up.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>Hiking up Walker Creek is quite pleasant overall. You ascend ~400\nfeet of elevation, and as the creek cliffs out above you, with a pretty,\nmossy waterfall up on the right, you will notice the Walker Mine, and an\nexit trail on the left. The mine is worth checking out, as it goes back\nquiet a ways, and has a somewhat functioning mining cart inside!</p>\n<p>Hike out that trail, as it traverses to the old mine camp. From here,\na trail keeps traversing away, but you don't want that! Instead, just\nstart going straight up the ridge to your right. You'll find the Walker\nMine Trail cutting up to your left soon. It is often covered in\ndeadfall, or brushy, and does have some poison oak, but is actually\npretty easy to follow if you pay attention (at least for the first bit).\nIt cuts steeply out of the canyon, with some nice views of the East\nFork, getting quite overgrown on the way.</p>\n<p>Eventually it flattens out on the rim of Wildcat. Look for the trail\nto stay close to the edge here for a bit, and then climb up into the\ntrees, following a wood with just a ridiculous amount of big dead logs\nlaying on top of it. Again, a GPS is useful here. Once the trail starts\nclimbing up the steep ridge ahead, if you can find it, you should be\nable to stay on it easily from there on out. It actually becomes very\npretty as you get near the top, with good views at several false summits\nthat will fake you out along the way.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n",
