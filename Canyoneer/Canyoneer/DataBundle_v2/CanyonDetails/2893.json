  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>An amazing backcountry canyon into Tehipite. This one is probably\nbetter than Blue Canyon, if for no reason other than it's a bit easier\nto access. Also it has lots of jumps! The water can definitely get heavy\nin here, and it is more technical, requires a good bit of thought at\ntimes.</p>\n<p>A three day trip where you camp at the rim and do Crown Creek as a\nloop in one really long day where the hike back up will probably be\nmiserable could work for a ultra-fit group (that took us 22 hours). Or\nmaybe bringing light bivy gear and camping in the bottom, but as little\nstuff as you can take through the canyon will be good. While not as\nnecessary with Crown Creek as it would be for Blue Canyon, getting Clyde\nPack Outfit to carry your stuff would probably be well worth it.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>Hike out towards the trail down into Tehipite Valley. Just south of\nthe Park Boundary is a good place to cut down towards the canyon.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>Lots of big waterfall rappels and jumping. Watch for tight spots\nwhere the canyon constricts, especially when there is a lot of\nwater.</p>\n<p>Eventually it opens up into some boulder hopping. Definitely not over\nyet. Soon the canyon drops off into a deep deep slot and turns 90\ndegrees left. This drop is about 150 feet, and can be anchored on the\nright, which makes for a challenging swim past the waterfall to get out\nof the slot. Pulling the rope from the deep pool at the bottom here is\nalso interesting.</p>\n<p>Just down from here there are some trees on the left. If you make a\nshort rappel, you should be able to exit the water course on the left.\nCheck the time, see what you want to do. We bailed right here, so I\ndon't really have good beta on what's down below. Silver Spray Falls is\nthe big final drop. My guess is that it is 250 feet. Could be way more,\nor maybe a bit less. I'd say if you brought a 400 foot rope you would be\nsafe. Your call.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>A mile to the right and then up and out of the valley. This is where\nyou will wish you had hired pack horses if you didn't. It's really quite\npleasant carrying nothing more than a day pack.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<p>Permits required</p>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a\nhref=\"http://canyoncollective.com/threads/crown-creek.18633/#post-76368\">http://canyoncollective.com/threads/crown-creek.18633/#post-76368</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<p><a\nhref=\"https://www.instagram.com/s/aGlnaGxpZ2h0OjE3ODYxMzExOTIyMDYzODgw?story_media_id=2369929214239424253&amp;igshid=YmMyMTA2M2Y=\">https://www.instagram.com/s/aGlnaGxpZ2h0OjE3ODYxMzExOTIyMDYzODgw?story_media_id=2369929214239424253&amp;igshid=YmMyMTA2M2Y=</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n",
