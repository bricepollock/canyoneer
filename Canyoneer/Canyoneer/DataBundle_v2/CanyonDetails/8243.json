Unlike other parts of the country (ex: the\nColorado Plateau), canyoning is not widely known or recognized here.\nIndividuals climbing, rappelling, or slack-lining around very public\n\"show waterfalls\" such as Salt Creek Falls are far more likely to garner\nnegative reactions from the public at large. Unfortunately, negative\npublicity leads to more rules and regulations by local land\nmanagers.</p>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a\nhref=\"http://www.waterfallsnorthwest.com/nws/falls.php?num=4153\">Northwest\nWaterfall Survey</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n"
