The locals remove them when they\nexit. Be wary - the best rappel line uses a redirect, do NOT set your\nrappel to put you into the water flow. The fall is too forceful. Descend\nthe single powerful waterfall from a tree, or set up a guided rappel.\nThere is a strong swim required at the base of the rappel to exit the\npool.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<p>We descended this \"canyon\" (though it is really just a short hike to\na single fall) twice on our trip to Costa Rica, first as a normal\ndescent with our strongest swimmer going first and waiting with a rescue\nthrow rope. The second time we set up a guided rappel for fun. The trail\nis short, and you can rappel this waterfall more than once if you are\ninclined.</p>\n<p><a\nhref=\"https://www.chasingadventure29.com/TripReports/Aquiares-Fall\">https://www.chasingadventure29.com/TripReports/Aquiares-Fall</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n",
