Avoid any 4th class climbing by moving out right, but too far right leads to heavy bush whacking.<\/li>\n<li>Along the way find the hidden mini double arch cave (tiger view cave).<\/li>\n<li>Aim for the small saddle above you to the West - this is the top of the climb.<\/li><\/ul>\n<p>The route starts at the watercourse atop the slabby sandstone ridge.
