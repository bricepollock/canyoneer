  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>If you are lucky enough to hit these falls when they are flowing, you\nare in for a big day as they are the biggest waterfalls in Moab and\nrarely occur. Be prepared for flow in the range of 5 - 10CFS. The falls\nflow seemingly out of nowhere, as the source is a pipe coming out of a\nmine shaft that is used to release water from the mine on occasion.\nThese falls are created by dam release just above Ken's Lake in Spanish\nValley area on the south side of Moab.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>Park on the switchback just past Ken's Lake.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>Anchor off any number of bushes on either side of the canyon. For the\nbig falls at the bottom, use a stout bush canyon left in order to direct\nyour descent down the middle of the falls for the most fun. These falls\nlook very intimidating, yet are spread wide and aerated and can be taken\nalmost entirely on the legs until the very bottom. There is a drop off\nat the bottom on canyon right. The pool was waist deep in May 2016.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>Numerous use trails from spectators and hikers on canyon left to get\nback up to your car.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><img src=\"rwl_en.png\" title=\"rwl_en.png\" alt=\"rwl_en.png\" /><a\nhref=\"http://climb-utah.com/Moab/faux.htm\">Climb-Utah.com</a> : Faux\nFalls - Moab</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n",
