Be prepared for flow in the range of 5 - 10CFS. The falls flow seemingly out of nowhere, as the source is a pipe coming out of a mine shaft that is used to release water from the mine on occasion. These falls are created by dam release just above Ken's Lake in Spanish Valley area on the south side of Moab.\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Park on the switchback just past Ken's Lake.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Anchor off any number of bushes on either side of the canyon.
