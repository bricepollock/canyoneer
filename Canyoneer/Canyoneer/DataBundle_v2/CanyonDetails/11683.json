  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>Machinery Creek is a pleasant canyon that is suitable, and much more\ninteresting, when rainfall / high water make other nearby canyoning\noptions too dangerous.</p>\n<p>The creek gets its name from the rusted machinery and scrap metal\nleft behind from nearby old mines. Note that this means that there is\nvery minor pollution of the water by heavy metals, consider bringing\ndrinking water.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>Park behind the Round Hill Caf√©, near the intersection of Cethana\nRoad and Staverton Road, Cethana. If you are doing a car shuffle, park\nthe lower vehicle in one of the pull-ins either side of the Forth River\nBridge.</p>\n<p>From behind the cafe, follow a dirt road west. Veer right as you pass\na driveway that leads to a house on the left. The road is blocked to\nvehicles from this point, but is a distinct and well made old dirt road.\nFollow the old road for approximately 1.5kms as it winds its way gently\naround the hillside. At one point you pass one of the old mines that\ngive the creek its name, which can be explored. Just after a small creek\ncrosses the road an obvious footpad drops to the right, leading down to\nthe creek a short way below.</p>\n<p>Once in the creek, continue downstream for about 500m.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>All abseils anchors are bolts with chains. Some abseils have multiple\nsets of anchors, allowing you to either follow the flow of the water or\ndescend a dry option.</p>\n<p>The first abseil is 15m.</p>\n<p>This is followed by a second 15m abseil.</p>\n<p>The third abseil is 12m.</p>\n<p>The next drop is an awkward 5m abseil from on top of a large boulder.\nThe chains may be difficult to reach. Consider installing a safety line\nfrom two bolts further back.</p>\n<p>A nice 10m abseil spits you out above a series of chutes and\npools.</p>\n<p>The final 28m abseil -- from a few metres to canyon right on the\nlow-angle slab -- deposits you in a large pool.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>Follow the creek downstream for about half an hour. When you reach\nthe culvert where the creek flows underneath Cethana Road, either climb\nup the slope to the road, or walk through the concrete culvert to the\nriver. An easy track goes from here up to the road.</p>\n<p>If you have not left a vehicle at the bridge, whoever gets the short\nstraw has to either try to hitch a ride or walk beside the road as it\nwinds up the hill and back to the cafe.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<p>Thank the nice folk at Cradle Mountain Canyons for maintaining the\ncanyon.</p>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><img src=\"rwl_fr.png\" title=\"rwl_fr.png\" alt=\"rwl_fr.png\" /><a\nhref=\"http://descente-canyon.com/canyoning/canyon-description/23333\">Descente-Canyon.com</a>\n: Machinery Creek</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n",
