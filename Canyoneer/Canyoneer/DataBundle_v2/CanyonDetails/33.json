It also has 3 more shorter rappels including an optional 160ft rappel under the road to access the canyon. It is a great canyon to run through any time of the year. With a usually constant small flow of water and trees, it can be a nice short escape on a hot summer day.\n<\/p>\n<ul><li><ul><li>As with all the Big T canyons your help is needed to keep access open. This entire area is still seeing a slow recovery from the old station fire which means lots of invasive plants and overgrowth in general can quickly close off access to these areas and\/or make your time in them miserable. Consider adding a pair of hand shears and\/or small bypass loppers to your gear list when descending these places.<\/li><\/ul><\/li><\/ul>\n<pre><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http:\/\/aggie-horticulture.tamu.edu\/earthkind\/landscape\/proper-pruning-techniques\/\">Educate yourself on how and why<\/a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"http:\/\/ep.yimg.com\/ay\/yhst-136001134851880\/forester-8-1-4-by-pass-pro-forged-pruner-pr7240-3.jpg\">[1]<\/a>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https:\/\/www.nationalforests.org\/who-we-are\/our-impact\/angeles\">BIG TUJUNGA CANYON RESTORATION<\/a>\n<\/pre>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Park in a dirt pull-off along Big Tujunga Canyon Road at 34.297410°, -118.174507°\n<\/p><p>Head South (up the road) crossing over to the other side. There is a use trail that goes down into the drainage ditch where you will find a large culvert going under the road. \n<\/p><p>This first rappel through the culvert can be avoided by staying on the side of the road you parked and heading down the steep dirt slope into the canyon at the inside of the first sharp bend. Rappelling through the culvert is pretty unique however and well worth it.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p><b>Rappel 1: 160 feet (Optional)<\/b> Shortly after entering the culvert there is a bolted anchor RDC. The culvert gets a bit steeper after this but it's never vertical. It's a fun rappel and you can see the end of the tunnel once you get to the anchor. You may need headlamps to set up the anchor as it's pretty dark in here. If it has rained recently, there may be water flowing here, so this is something to watch out for. There are also side drainages through which water could be flowing. \n<\/p><p>If you choose to skip this rappel then just cross over to the other side of the road and go down the steep dirt slope where you will end up at the end of the culvert.\n<\/p><p>From here make your way down the canyon through the thick (and sometimes full of thorns) brush to the top of the second rappel.\n<\/p><p><b>Rappel 2: 25 feet (Optional)<\/b> There is a nice 25 foot waterfall anchored low on a tree RDC about 25 feet from the lip. This can also be down-climbed RDC\n<\/p><p><b>Rappel 3: 80 feet<\/b> Anchor is now off a downed tree in the watercourse. As of 10\/24\/14 several fallen trees have clogged up the bottom of the rappel with branches and debris that make it difficult to reach the bottom. A second anchor\/redirect off a large living tree LDC about halfway through the rappel can be used to avoid this mess.\n<\/p><p><b>Rappel 4: 170 feet<\/b> Anchored center canyon.
