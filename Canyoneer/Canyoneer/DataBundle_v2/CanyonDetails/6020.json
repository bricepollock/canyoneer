  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>A wonderful canyon with a big 250'+ foot waterfall about an hour\ndrive from Seattle (there are a few miles of dirt road driving. The\nupper creek makes for a wonderful 3/4 day adventure with a mountain\nbiking / hiking approach and logging road walk back to the bicycles for\na 2.5 mile ride back to the car.</p>\n<p>A new exit out of Lower has been established and is pretty\nstraightforward, taking about 45 minutes from the point where you exit\nthe creek to the cars at the parking for the exit from Upper.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>For the lowest pay-to-play ratio paying for a parking permit from\nCampbell Global logging company is the best way to go. If doing so, the\nexit hike becomes a 60 second walk and the approach hike is about 20\nminutes. For the approach the drop in is JUST BELOW THE CANDY CANE\nshaped tube on the logging road. A pretty visible use trail has emerged\nto zig zag down to the watercourse right at rappel 1.</p>\n<p>If parking behind the gate, it will add several hours to your day.\nTotal hiking approach is between 3.5 and 4 miles each way. The approach\nis on good logging roads, but cannot be driven without a motorized\naccess pass and gate key. Mountain bikes make a great option for the\napproach, but retrieval can be complicated if exiting via option #1 or\noption #3.</p>\n<p>To get there take I-90 to exit 31 North Bend. Go 3.6 miles on North\nBend Way and turn left on to Ballarat Ave. North. In 0.7 mile the main\nroad turns right and becomes NE 12th Street. Go another half mile and\nthe main road turns left and becomes 428th Ave SE. Follow the road for\n2.9 miles. The name of the road changes to SE North Fork Road. After 2.9\nmiles you come to an intersection of North Fork Rd. SE and SE Ernieâ€™s\nGrove Road. Bear left and drive up hill 0.4 mile to where the pavement\nends. Continue about four more miles and you come to a major\nintersection with a gated road on the right. This is gate 11.</p>\n<p>From the gate, walk or bike about a mile and a half and cross the\nNorth Fork Snoqualmie River on a bridge. Turn right and go about a mile\nto an intersection. This is a good place to stash bikes if you are\nplanning to complete the upper canyon or have figured out exit #2.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p><strong>Upper Rachor</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>R1: 50' DCL</strong> off a tree. This has been named\nGuardian Falls by Brian Swan.<br />\n</li>\n<li><strong>R2: 45' DCL</strong> down a chute off bolts. This chute can\nbe done as a protected downclimb at lower flow.<br />\n</li>\n<li><strong>R3: 40' DCL</strong> off bolts into a photogenic slot. There\nis webbing off a DCL tree to rig a traverse line to access the rappel\nanchor, which is exposed. Use caution approaching the top in the flow as\nthere is a siphon at the edge, which can also stick your rope if you\naren't careful about the pull.<br />\n</li>\n<li>Travel around the bend down a down-climbable slope</li>\n<li><strong>R4: 60' DCL</strong> webbing threaded through the roots of a\nhuge log into a deep pool. There is now a giant log strainer in the\nmiddle of the pool that needs to be navigated with care. It is possible\nto downclimb the logs DCL. <strong>This is not a slide</strong></li>\n<li><strong>R5: 20' DCR</strong> webbing around a pinch into a fun chute\nin the flow. It is possible to downclimb the entire drop DCL (dry)</li>\n<li><strong>R6: Old Spur Falls. 95' DCR</strong> chain anchor. This\nanchor is exposed on slippery rock, and a retrievable traverse line is\nrecommended to access. Bolts for a 20' traverse line are available\nDCR.<br />\n</li>\n<li><strong>R7: 60' DCL</strong> off a tree. This rappel becomes\nfree-hanging as the rock is undercut towards the bottom, requiring a\nswimming release in the waterfall.<br />\n</li>\n<li>This is the end of Upper Rachor. Exit DCR immediately after R7, and\nfollow the logging road.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Lower Rachor</strong></p>\n<p><em>This section of the canyon has been descended three known times\nas of July 2022.</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>R8: 25' DCL</strong> off a boulder wrap.<br />\n</li>\n<li><strong>R9: 40' DCL</strong> tree.</li>\n<li><strong>R10: 50' DCL</strong> bolts hidden from the top, wrap a tree\nto go 8ft down to a ledge to see the bolts for a very wet rappel. Or Rap\noff of the tree itself for a dry rappel.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The 300ft falls rappel sequence has three pitches.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>R11: 300' DCL</strong> from tree all the way to the bottom\nof Rachor Falls, <strong>or 40</strong>' to a set of bolts.<br />\n</li>\n<li><strong>R12: 30' DCL</strong> bolts, go down and left around a knob\nand out of sight on a fin with good footing to a single bolt rebelay\nwith narrow footing.<br />\n</li>\n<li><strong>R13: 225' DCL</strong> SINGLE BOLT USE AT YOUR OWN RISK,\n180' to a shallow pool then continue 40' down the next drop to a shallow\npool. For the pull be sure to bring the pull side DCR of the vertical\nlog at the bottom if it remains. IT IS NOT RECOMMENDED TO USE A SINGLE\nBOLT.<br />\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p><strong>Upper Section</strong></p>\n<p>If only doing the upper canyon proceed DCR from below Old Spur Falls\nand follow the overgrown logging road back to the log pile near SMC\nfalls.</p>\n<p><strong>Lower Section</strong></p>\n<p>After the big falls, bag up your rope and get ready for some of the\nbest downclimbing around. Downclimb about 1,000 feet or so until the\nfirst place the walls relent and there is a steep bear trail visible on\nDCR. 47.5445, -121.7115. Scramble and side step up a steep and very soft\nslope until you reach the edge of the clear cut. Stay on the faint bear\ntrail most of the way. Stay out of the clear cut for easy hiking under\nthe canopy near the top of the canyon ridge until you reach the cars.\nResist the tendency to go left.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<p>In 2015 Campbell Global bought the land surrounding Rachor Creek. To\nquote their website<a href=\"https://sqrecreation.com/\">1</a>, <em>\"All\naccess requires a permit including entry by bicycle, horseback and\nwalk-in. [...] Annual individual and family permits are $60. Day use\npermits cost $10 for an individual and $15 for a family. For the purpose\nof this permit, family is defined as married spouses and their children\nless than 19 years of age.\".</em> The extensive list of regulations\ninclude a ban on electric-bikes, drones, and alcohol.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>2020 Access Map: <a\nhref=\"https://sqrecreation.com/sites/default/files/Snoqualmie_Forest_Recreation_Access_Map_2020.pdf\">https://sqrecreation.com/sites/default/files/Snoqualmie_Forest_Recreation_Access_Map_2020.pdf</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>In dry years all access to land will be closed due to forest fire\ndanger - usually coincident with prime canyon season.</p>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><img src=\"rwl_en.png\" title=\"rwl_en.png\" alt=\"rwl_en.png\" /><a\nhref=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20210527212206/www.canyoneeringnorthwest.com/RachorCreek/Rachor_Creek.php\">CanyoneeringNorthwest.com\n(archive.org)</a> : Rachor Creek</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n<p>Beta originally provided by Steve Abercrombie / Ken Liebert. 1st\nDescent of Upper Creek in 2011. 1st Descent of Rachor Falls and lower\ncreek in 2014.</p>\n",
