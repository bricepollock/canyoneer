{"rappelLongestMeters":91.44,"timeRating":"IV","name":"Rachor Creek","url":"https:\/\/ropewiki.com\/Rachor_Creek","quality":3.5,"description":"<div class=\"mw-content-ltr mw-parser-output\" lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><p>A wonderful canyon with a big 250'  foot waterfall about an hour drive from Seattle (there are a few miles of dirt road driving. The upper creek makes for a wonderful 3\/4 day adventure with a mountain biking \/ hiking approach and logging road walk back to the bicycles for a 2.5 mile ride back to the car.\n<\/p><p>A new exit out of Lower has been established and is pretty straightforward, taking about 45 minutes from the point where you exit the creek to the cars at the parking for the exit from Upper.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>For the lowest pay-to-play ratio paying for a parking permit from Campbell Global logging company is the best way to go.  If doing so, the exit hike becomes a 60 second walk and the approach hike is about 20 minutes.  For the approach the drop in is JUST BELOW THE CANDY CANE shaped tube on the logging road.  A pretty visible use trail has emerged to zig zag down to the watercourse right at rappel 1. \n<\/p><p>If parking behind the gate, it will add several hours to your day.  Total hiking approach is between 3.5 and 4 miles each way. The approach is on good logging roads, but cannot be driven without a motorized access pass and gate key. Mountain bikes make a great option for the approach, but retrieval can be complicated if exiting via option #1 or option #3.\n<\/p><p>To get there take I-90 to exit 31 North Bend. Go 3.6 miles on North Bend Way and turn left on to Ballarat Ave. North. In 0.7 mile the main road turns right and becomes NE 12th Street. Go another half mile and the main road turns left and becomes 428th Ave SE. Follow the road for 2.9 miles. The name of the road changes to SE North Fork Road. After 2.9 miles you come to an intersection of North Fork Rd. SE and SE Ernie’s Grove Road. Bear left and drive up hill 0.4 mile to where the pavement ends. Continue about four more miles and you come to a major intersection with a gated road on the right. This is gate 11.\n<\/p><p>From the gate, walk or bike about a mile and a half and cross the North Fork Snoqualmie River on a bridge. Turn right and go about a mile to an intersection. This is a good place to stash bikes if you are planning to complete the upper canyon or have figured out exit #2.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p><b>Upper Rachor<\/b>\n<\/p>\n<ul><li><b>R1: 50' DCL<\/b> off a tree.
