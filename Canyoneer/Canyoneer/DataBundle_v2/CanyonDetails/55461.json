  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>A lot of brushy creekwalking at the beginning for 4 sweet waterfall\nrappels. Beautiful vegetation all the way down, and some good views on a\nclear day. Quite open. Especially fun at higher water.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>You can follow the kml from the dirt road up top to do the 1st bonus\nrap or just start down at the main road, which gets you above the 2nd.\nthe approach is along the drainage, bushwacking on either side or down\nthe middle to find the path of least resistance. There some little\ndownclimbs in here before you get to the rappels.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>R1 is a bonus rap off of a tree RDC. This drops you right above the\nroad so feels a bit silly. After this there is a lot of not so fun\ncreekwalking, but the 4 rappels of the center part are very fun. The\nmain 4 are bolted but the bolts can be difficult to find if covered with\nmoss. It's a lot of brushy creek scrambling to get to R6 and there are\nseveral trails leaving the drainage LDC so you can also just skip this\nlast rappel if you want.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>You will either end at a dirt road, if you do the full route, or take\nan exit path LDC after the 5th rap. The path is obvious and if you just\ntake the descending option when coming to forks, you should be fine.\nsomeone needs to make a map for this.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<p>It is best to get in touch with Enock of Club Xel (+52 55 4766 1825)\nto do these Agua Blanca canyons. He will set you up with sweet food and\naccommodation and maybe help with shuttles. If he's around, he might go\nwith you. This is mostly ejidal land and it really is best to know a\nlocal. At least, explain what you're doing to anyone you come across and\nask if it's ok if you continue. Should speak some Spanish.</p>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n",
