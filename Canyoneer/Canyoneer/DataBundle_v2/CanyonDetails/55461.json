There some little downclimbs in here before you get to the rappels.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>R1 is a bonus rap off of a tree RDC. This drops you right above the road so feels a bit silly. After this there is a lot of not so fun creekwalking, but the 4 rappels of the center part are very fun. The main 4 are bolted but the bolts can be difficult to find if covered with moss. It's a lot of brushy creek scrambling to get to R6 and there are several trails leaving the drainage LDC so you can also just skip this last rappel if you want.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>You will either end at a dirt road, if you do the full route, or take an exit path LDC after the 5th rap. The path is obvious and if you just take the descending option when coming to forks, you should be fine. someone needs to make a map for this.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Red_tape\">Red tape<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>It is best to get in touch with Enock of Club Xel ( 52 55 4766 1825) to do these Agua Blanca canyons. He will set you up with sweet food and accommodation and maybe help with shuttles. If he's around, he might go with you. This is mostly ejidal land and it really is best to know a local. At least, explain what you're doing to anyone you come across and ask if it's ok if you continue.
