  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>The upper northern fork of the more famous <a\nhref=\"http://ropewiki.com/Rock_Creek_(Skamania_County)\">Rock Creek</a>.\nThis fork drains the southern slopes of Mowich Butte. With a smaller\nwatershed, this fork sports lower flow and is open for business much\nearlier in the season. The flow on this section of Rock Creek seems to\ndrop out pretty early -- you can often run it far earlier than other\ncreeks in the vicinity. It may not be worth your time after April or\nso.</p>\n<p>The Upper North Fork of Rock Creek sports three tributaries which all\nhave waterfalls. The best bit, however, is the main line below the\nconfluence. These falls are often visited by waterfall photographers, so\nplease use dull, natural-colored webbing (or black) for anchors.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Watershed: 0.88mi^2.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>Google Terrain maps show the \"Sunset-Hemlock Rd\" (FR 41) running\nalong the crest - but this road has been closed and pretty much\nobliterated by Washington State DNR with berms every 20ft. Getting a car\nin there is not feasible, making the PCT the only viable approach to\nthis creek.</p>\n<h3 id=\"directions\">Directions</h3>\n<p>From the Bridge of the Gods, turn right on Hwy 14 and continue 1.5mi\neast to turn off left/north towards Skamania Lodge on Rock Creek Dr.\nTurn left again in 0.3mi onto SW Foster Creek Rd. Continue 0.4mi and\ncontinue straight onto SW Ryan Allen Rd for another 0.5mi before turning\nleft again onto Red Bluff Rd (becomes gravel). Follow Red Bluff Rd for\n5.7mi to a bridge across Rock Creek. (Steep Creek Falls is just upstream\n/ left of the bridge.) Continue west on Red Bluff Rd for 1.5mi to a\njunction where the main road swings left to cross a bridge over Rock\nCreek. Continue up the main road for another 0.8mi and turn right at an\nunsigned junction (Jct 1380). Follow this unnamed road for 0.5mi,\npassing a campsite near a creek at the bottom. On heading up the hill,\nwatch for the crossing of the PCT and continue 200ft to a large pullout\nwith room for several vehicles on the left. Roads are rocky but 2WD okay\nif driven carefully.</p>\n<h3 id=\"hike_in\">Hike In</h3>\n<p>From the parking area, follow the well maintained PCT north for about\n1.75mi. At this point the trail crosses the western tributary just above\nR3. Options:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Drop directly into the western tributary from here.</li>\n<li>Continue on up the switchbacks another 0.25mi and enter the western\ntributary higher up.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<h3 id=\"west_tributary\">West Tributary</h3>\n<p>Leave the PCT at the end of a switchback at about 2350' elevation.\nHead directly west and drop down into the tributary (2min). This\ntributary seems to sport pretty low water and likely dries up entirely\nby the end of the summer.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>R1: 50ft. Two stage. Low angle ramp which then swings DCL and drops\ndown a second ramp to a small pool. Beware pendulum potential.</li>\n<li>R2: 12ft drop into mini-narrows. Pass through 20ft long bedrock\ncorridor to another slide falls (~20ft). No good anchors in the\ncorridor, so anchored off large tree DCL at top of short drop. Need\nabout 100ft of rope (SRT) per the horizontal distance.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Head down a moderately overgrown stream about 2min to reach the PCT.\nR3 is immediately below the trail.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>R3: 25ft. Retrievable anchor recommended per proximity to the\ntrail.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Head downstream wherever is easiest to reach the main fork. Staying\nin the creek was quite brushy when visiting in July 2016. In some places\nit was easier to hop out and hike down the adjacent bank wherever was\neasiest. On reaching the confluence, head downstream.</p>\n<h3 id=\"upper_north_fork\">Upper North Fork</h3>\n<p>This segment is the best bit:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>R4: <em>North Fork Rock Creek Falls</em>. 25ft. Can be bypassed\nDCR.</li>\n<li>R5: 30ft falls over shelf of columnar basalt. Photogenic.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>About 5-10min downstream, encounter a low-angle waterslide into a\nchest-deep pool. Easily downclimbed.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>R6: 20ft falls over stair-step shelf. Possible swimmer in high\nwater.</li>\n<li>R7: 35ft. Calf-deep pool on landing. Watch for sharp edges on the\nlip.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>Exiting DCR directly after R7 is feasible, but very steep /\nstrenuous. Instead continue downstream another 5min to the confluence\nwith the Lower North Fork. Just before the confluence, look for an\nanimal trail DCR that provides an easy means of access up onto a spur\nridge west of the creek. Once atop the ridge go directly up a steep\nbrushy slope to reach the PCT. The steep slope is easily overcome,\ntaking all of about 2min of thrashing. Once back on the trail, hike\nsouth ~1mi back to your car.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<p>This area is on state land run by the Washington State Department of\nNatural Resources (DNR). While not signed, it is possible that a\nWashington State Discovery Pass may be required at the trailhead. (??)\nDNR does patrol Red Bluff Road occasionally.</p>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<p><a\nhref=\"https://www.waterfallsnorthwest.com/waterfall/North-Fork-Rock-Creek-Falls-5120\">Northwest\nWaterfall Survey</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n<p>Creek was first descended by Kevin Clark and Kaitlin Rupert in July\n2016.</p>\n<p>The center and eastern tributaries on the Upper North Fork have been\nexplored. Central tributary: +3 falls, but very low water and very\nbrushy. Eastern tributary: +1 falls, but a long stream walk down to the\nmain stem. Both of these options are probably not worth your time.</p>\n",
