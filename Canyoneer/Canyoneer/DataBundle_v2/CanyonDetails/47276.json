This fork drains the southern slopes of Mowich Butte.  With a smaller watershed, this fork sports lower flow and is open for business much earlier in the season.  The flow on this section of Rock Creek seems to drop out pretty early -- you can often run it far earlier than other creeks in the vicinity.  It may not be worth your time after April or so.\n<\/p><p>The Upper North Fork of Rock Creek sports three tributaries which all have waterfalls.  The best bit, however, is the main line below the confluence.  These falls are often visited by waterfall photographers, so please use dull, natural-colored webbing (or black) for anchors.\n<\/p>\n<ul><li>Watershed: 0.88mi^2.<\/li><\/ul>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Google Terrain maps show the \"Sunset-Hemlock Rd\" (FR 41) running along the crest - but this road has been closed and pretty much obliterated by Washington State DNR with berms every 20ft.

Continue 0.4mi and continue straight onto SW Ryan Allen Rd for another 0.5mi before turning left again onto Red Bluff Rd (becomes gravel).  Follow Red Bluff Rd for 5.7mi to a bridge across Rock Creek.  (Steep Creek Falls is just upstream \/ left of the bridge.)  Continue west on Red Bluff Rd for 1.5mi to a junction where the main road swings left to cross a bridge over Rock Creek.  Continue up the main road for another 0.8mi and turn right at an unsigned junction (Jct 1380).  Follow this unnamed road for 0.5mi, passing a campsite near a creek at the bottom.  On heading up the hill, watch for the crossing of the PCT and continue 200ft to a large pullout with room for several vehicles on the left.  Roads are rocky but 2WD okay if driven carefully.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading3\"><h3 id=\"Hike_In\">Hike In<\/h3><\/div>\n<p>From the parking area, follow the well maintained PCT north for about 1.75mi.

Two stage.  Low angle ramp which then swings DCL and drops down a second ramp to a small pool.  Beware pendulum potential.<\/li>\n<li>R2:  12ft drop into mini-narrows.  Pass through 20ft long bedrock corridor to another slide falls (~20ft).  No good anchors in the corridor, so anchored off large tree DCL at top of short drop. Need about 100ft of rope (SRT) per the horizontal distance.<\/li><\/ul>\n<p>Head down a moderately overgrown stream about 2min to reach the PCT.

Instead continue downstream another 5min to the confluence with the Lower North Fork.  Just before the confluence, look for an animal trail DCR that provides an easy means of access up onto a spur ridge west of the creek.  Once atop the ridge go directly up a steep brushy slope to reach the PCT.  The steep slope is easily overcome, taking all of about 2min of thrashing.  Once back on the trail, hike south ~1mi back to your car.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Red_tape\">Red tape<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>None.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Beta_sites\">Beta sites<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media<\/h2><\/div>\n<p><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https:\/\/www.waterfallsnorthwest.com\/waterfall\/North-Fork-Rock-Creek-Falls-5120\">Northwest Waterfall Survey<\/a>\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Background\">Background<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Creek was first descended by Kevin Clark and Kaitlin Rupert in July 2016.\n<\/p><p>The center and eastern tributaries on the Upper North Fork have been explored.
