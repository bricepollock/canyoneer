Then you need to walk down keeping to the main social trail, trending down and left.  You will eventually find a flatter area with three bolts in a large rock in the ground.  It is also recommended to go down to the exit and put up a fixed line for the climb out before you rappel down.

Note that this section has a significant number of spots where a fall would be bad.  None of it is scary, just take your time.  The 5.4 climb has 2 bolts on top, so it is normal to put up a fixed line on it before you rappel the falls to use to ascend. \n<\/p><p>2. Creek exit.  The official trail following Cove Creek no longer exists after a flood in 2018, but you can continue down the creek and hike all the way out (1 mile of creek walking followed by 1 mile of trail).
