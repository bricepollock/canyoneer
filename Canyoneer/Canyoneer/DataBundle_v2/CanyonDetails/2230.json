Unlike other parts of the country (ex: the Colorado Plateau), canyoning is not widely known or recognized here. Individuals climbing, rappelling, or slack-lining around \"show waterfalls\" (such as Falls Creek Falls) are far more likely to garner negative reactions from the public at large. Negative reactions lead to complaints and more rules by the local authorities. Locals suggest running such falls during the off-season and on weekdays when numbers of other visitors will be low.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Beta_sites\">Beta
