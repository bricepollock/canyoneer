  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>The East Inlet flows into Grand Lake on the West side of Rocky\nMountain National Park, forming some of the highest headwaters of the\nColorado River Basin.</p>\n<p>Four impressive waterfalls form through a series of rock bands with\nsome pools and narrows. Depending on the amount of water, this canyon\ncan present a straight forward aquatic descent or in higher flow may\nrequire bypassing obstacles and creating new anchors.</p>\n<p>While a USGS monitoring location does exist for East Inlet, it\ncurrnetly does not measure CFS. A nearby gauge exists at North Inlet\nwhich has a similar drainage basin. While this cannot predict increased\nflows caused by more localized weather events, it can give a general\nidea of where the flows might be in the region. Gauge flows before\nentering this canyon at Adams Falls and at the start of the canyon</p>\n<p>East Inlet Gauge (For Reference): <a\nhref=\"https://waterdata.usgs.gov/monitoring-location/09013500/#parameterCode=00010&amp;period=P7D\">https://waterdata.usgs.gov/monitoring-location/09013500/#parameterCode=00010&amp;period=P7D</a></p>\n<p>North Inlet Gauge (CFS Data): <a\nhref=\"https://waterdata.usgs.gov/monitoring-location/401530105475401/#parameterCode=00060&amp;period=P7D\">https://waterdata.usgs.gov/monitoring-location/401530105475401/#parameterCode=00060&amp;period=P7D</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p><b>Driving:</b> The hike starts at the East Inlet trailhead. From the\nmain street in downtown Grand Lake, continue heading east. At the end of\nthe downtown area, the street becomes a dirt road, passing through a\nseries of cabins and homes. Follow signs to Adams Falls and the East\nInlet trailhead.</p>\n<p>Driving south on Highway 34 (Trail Ridge Road) towards Grand Lake,\ntake the business bypass (not marked left turn onto a paved road a few\nhundred feet from Highway 34, but an obvious fork to the left). Follow\nthis road to the end, which is the East Inlet trailhead.</p>\n<p><b>Hiking:</b> Hike up the east inlet trail 3.3 miles. Stop at the\nAdams Falls overlook near the beginning of the trail. This narrow\nsection is not part of described canyon route due to being more narrow\nthan waterfalls upstream. depart the trail when it nears the watercourse\nafter 3.3 miles, dropping over glacial bedrock, along a very well used\ntrail, to the river. Upstream looks calm. Downstream several small drops\nbegin. Suit up here.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>Find a calm spot upstream and swim across. Note, the current can be\nstrong even in the calm sections, so be sure to cross well above the\ndrops. Stay along the southern shore and hike, boulder hop, and\noccasionally wade along the southern bank of the stream to get below the\ncascades. Below you may see the dropoff for the first falls. Cross the\nriver above the falls in a calm area - and be careful! You should now be\nback along the northern bank. Note, it may be possible to avoid swimming\nacross the river, by staying along the bedrock of the northern banks of\nthe stream. You may need a rope as a handline, but it could save you\nsome swimming.</p>\n<p>The first falls has two tiers. The upper is a raging torrent of\nwhitewater, and the lower is a giant fan. Climb down the cliffs on the\nnorth side of the first tier - a handline around a tree will be helpful.\nContinue down the river, past the falls, following the shore. The river\nwill follow a small S-curve, then the canyon will begin to narrow. At\nthe end of the short narrow stretch is the second falls, but it can be\ntricky to get to.</p>\n<p>On the north shore, below the cliff faces is a small ledge with a\nlarge pine tree. Place a handline to one of the trees above and climb\ndown to this ledge. You must enter the river at this point, below the\nledge, staying against the north side of the stream. If the water is\nrunning heavy, use the tree on the ledge to set up a lowering system.\nThe person lowered will then anchor the rope, and a tyrolean can be set\nup (be sure to use a retrievable rope system - don't leave a fixed\nrope!).</p>\n<p><b>(Low Flow) R1 First Falls: 65'</b> from a tree on Canyon Left</p>\n<p><b>(Low Flow) R2 First Falls: 55'</b> from a tree on Canyon Left</p>\n<p><b>(Low water) R3 Second Falls: 80'</b> from a log in Canyon\nCenter</p>\n<p><b>High Flow Second Falls Bypass</b> by climbing on top of the cliffs\non canyon Right, which is the north rim. Proceed down the ledge system,\nutilizing a handline if required. Target returning to the river at the\nbase of the second falls.</p>\n<p>Soon the canyon narrows once again. The third falls is at the end of\nthis stretch of narrows.</p>\n<p><b>High Flow Third Falls Bypass</b> on Canyon Right and climb the\nnorthern rim, up several benches and ledges to a large bench with plenty\nof trees for use as anchors. The cliffs continue above, but the bench is\nsufficient. Walk to the base of the cliffs, and follow the base until it\ndrops off. Return to the river after the ledges and hike upstream to the\nview the Third Falls, which alone is worth the price of admission:\nsimilar to Ouzel Falls, but more picturesque.</p>\n<p><b>(Low water) R4: 80'</b> from a rock pinch in Canyon Center in the\n<b>Narrows above the Third Falls</b> to negotiate slippery drops caused\nby large boulders in this section</p>\n<p>The canyon narrows again at the Fourth Falls. Downclimb or rappel the\ncliffs next to the falls.</p>\n<p><b>Low water: R5: 60'</b> from a rock in Canyon Center</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>Continue to hike down the stream. Shortly the cascades end, the river\nbecomes placid, and it is easier to hike in the water rather than\nbashing through the bushes on the shore. Hike until the rapids begin\nagain - about 10 minutes or so. Then turn north (left, looking up\ncanyon) and hike cross-country until you reach the east inlet trail. Do\nnot continue down the river, as you'll pass by several backcountry camp\nsites, and these folks should not be disturbed. Your hike back will\nlikely include steep routefinding with fallen timber, so take your time\nand be careful. Take the trail back to your car, smiling all the\nway!</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<p>In 2021, Rocky Mountain National Park initiated a Timed-Entry Permit\nSystem between 9am and 3pm for all areas of the park between late May\nand early October.</p>\n<p><a\nhref=\"https://www.nps.gov/romo/planyourvisit/timed-entry-permit-system.htm\">https://www.nps.gov/romo/planyourvisit/timed-entry-permit-system.htm</a></p>\n<p><font color=red><b>Book Timed-Entry Permit here:</b></font> <a\nhref=\"https://www.recreation.gov/timed-entry/10086910\">https://www.recreation.gov/timed-entry/10086910</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<p>early 2000s: High Flow photos and initial write up by Michael\nDallin</p>\n<p>25Aug2012: Low Flow photos and modified write up by Ira Lewis (beta\nmodified Aug 2022)</p>\n<p>30Jul2016: See conditions reports for details and photos. \"We both\nagreed that the narrows and the third falls make this canyon an absolute\nmust-do in the Front Range.\"</p>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n",
