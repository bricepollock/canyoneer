the Colorado River Basin.\n<\/p><p>Four impressive waterfalls form through a series of rock bands with some pools and narrows. Depending on the amount of water, this canyon can present a straight forward aquatic descent or in higher flow may require bypassing obstacles and creating new anchors.\n<\/p><p>While a USGS monitoring location does exist for East Inlet, it currnetly does not measure CFS. A nearby gauge exists at North Inlet which has a similar drainage basin. While this cannot predict increased flows caused by more localized weather events, it can give a general idea of where the flows might be in the region.

Follow signs to Adams Falls and the East Inlet trailhead.\n<\/p><p>Driving south on Highway 34 (Trail Ridge Road) towards Grand Lake, take the business bypass (not marked left turn onto a paved road a few hundred feet from Highway 34, but an obvious fork to the left). Follow this road to the end, which is the East Inlet trailhead. \n<\/p><p><b>Hiking:<\/b> Hike up the east inlet trail 3.3 miles. Stop at the Adams Falls overlook near the beginning of the trail. This narrow section is not part of described canyon route due to being more narrow than waterfalls upstream. depart the trail when it nears the watercourse after 3.3 miles, dropping over glacial bedrock, along a very well used trail, to the river. Upstream looks calm. Downstream several small drops begin. Suit up here.\n<\/p>\n<link rel=\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\" href=\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1062633282\"> \n<div class=\"thumb tright\">\n<div style=\"display:table;\">\n<div class=\"thumbcaption\" style=\"display:table-caption;caption-side:bottom;box-sizing:border-box;\">{{{caption}}} <\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Find a calm spot upstream and swim across. Note, the current can be strong even in the calm sections, so be sure to cross well above the drops. Stay along the southern shore and hike, boulder hop, and occasionally wade along the southern bank of the stream to get below the cascades. Below you may see the dropoff for the first falls. Cross the river above the falls in a calm area - and be careful! You should now be back along the northern bank. Note, it may be possible to avoid swimming across the river, by staying along the bedrock of the northern banks of the stream. You may need a rope as a handline, but it could save you some swimming.\n<\/p><p>The first falls has two tiers. The upper is a raging torrent of whitewater, and the lower is a giant fan. Climb down the cliffs on the north side of the first tier - a handline around a tree will be helpful. Continue down the river, past the falls, following the shore. The river will follow a small S-curve, then the canyon will begin to narrow. At the end of the short narrow stretch is the second falls, but it can be tricky to get to.\n<\/p><p>On the north shore, below the cliff faces is a small ledge with a large pine tree. Place a handline to one of the trees above and climb down to this ledge. You must enter the river at this point, below the ledge, staying against the north side of the stream. If the water is running heavy, use the tree on the ledge to set up a lowering system. The person lowered will then anchor the rope, and a tyrolean can be set up (be sure to use a retrievable rope system - don't leave a fixed rope!).\n<\/p><p><b>(Low Flow) R1 First Falls: 65'<\/b> from a tree on Canyon Left\n<\/p><p><b>(Low Flow) R2 First Falls: 55'<\/b> from a tree on Canyon Left\n<\/p>\n<link rel=\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\" href=\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1062633282\"> \n<div class=\"thumb tright\">\n<div style=\"display:table;\">\n<div class=\"thumbcaption\" style=\"display:table-caption;caption-side:bottom;box-sizing:border-box;\">{{{caption}}} <\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<link rel=\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\" href=\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1062633282\"> \n<div class=\"thumb tright\">\n<div style=\"display:table;\">\n<div class=\"thumbcaption\" style=\"display:table-caption;caption-side:bottom;box-sizing:border-box;\">{{{caption}}} <\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<link rel=\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\" href=\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1062633282\"> \n<div class=\"thumb tright\">\n<div style=\"display:table;\">\n<span class=\"mw-default-size\" typeof=\"mw:Error mw:File\/Frameless\">\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p><b>(Low water) R3 Second Falls: 80'<\/b> from a log in Canyon Center\n<\/p><p>{{pic|pic17.jpg ~ <b>(Low Flow)<\/b> Top of R3 Second Falls; pic18.jpg ~ <b>(Low Flow)<\/b> R3 Second Falls; pic19.jpg ~ <b>(Low Flow)<\/b> R\n<\/p>\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nParsed by mw‐api‐ext.codfw.main‐6779cc57fc‐587wj\nCached time: 20240914191827\nCache expiry: 2592000\nReduced expiry: false\nComplications: []\nCPU time usage: 0.041 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.051 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 557\/1000000\nPost‐expand include size: 3999\/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 910\/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 8\/100\nExpensive parser function count: 0\/500\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0\/20\nUnstrip post‐expand size: 3174\/5000000 bytes\nLua time usage: 0.004\/10.000 seconds\nLua memory usage: 719355\/52428800 bytes\nNumber of Wikibase entities loaded: 0\/400\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%   37.680      1 -total\n 99.08%   37.333      6 Template:Pic\n 47.58%   17.929      6 Template:Str_number\/trim\n-->\n<\/div><div class=\"mw-content-ltr mw-parser-output\" lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><p>3 duck behind the falls; :EastInlet_R2.jpg ~ <b>(High Flow)<\/b> R3 Second Falls}}\n<\/p><p><b>High Flow Second Falls Bypass<\/b> by climbing on top of the cliffs on canyon Right, which is the north rim.

Shortly the cascades end, the river becomes placid, and it is easier to hike in the water rather than bashing through the bushes on the shore. Hike until the rapids begin again - about 10 minutes or so. Then turn north (left, looking up canyon) and hike cross-country until you reach the east inlet trail. Do not continue down the river, as you'll pass by several backcountry camp sites, and these folks should not be disturbed. Your hike back will likely include steep routefinding with fallen timber, so take your time and be careful.
