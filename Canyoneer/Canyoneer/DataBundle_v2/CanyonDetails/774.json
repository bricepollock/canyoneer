Walk through rolling dirt desert about 0.6 miles to where the dirt begins to extend out into slickrock. To go toward Raven and Headless Hen; walk northwest on a bearing of about 326 degrees for about 0.65 miles to where the open desert begins to hit slickrock. A GPS or good navigation skills will be helpful here as there are no obvious landmarks. (Data by bluugnome.com)",

          "description": "Boulder debris pile at the end of a corridor. This is the start of the 350 feet long X section in Big Tony. To bypass the X section climb up the boulder debris and make your way up to the LDC (east) rim to bypass the X section or go drop packs after the X section so you can return to do the X with no packs. Once on the rim route find your way about 350 feet down canyon to a slope where you can scramble back down into Big Tony after the X section. To travel down the X section; scramble under the boulder debris then imediately downclimb all the way to ground. Once on the ground the walls remain wide for a short distance then pinch in tight. While still on the floor squeeze into the crack continuing downcanyon. As you continue through the tight walls there are 3 tubes / wide spots that you can use to stem / upclimb straight up. Depending on how large you are will determine which of the 3 tubes you can get to. Larger people in the first tube; medium people in the second tube and smaller people in the third tube. Any of the tubes are reletively easy to stem up with flowing tiwsted features in semi narrow spaces. The first tube will require you to stem up higher and require you to stem over a silo near the top. If you are able to get to teh 2nd or 3rd tube you can avoid the silo just after the first tube. After getting up the tubes to a comfortable height; stem / galumph the rest of the X section. Most of the X Section you can be done back to feet but will be easier if stemmed and galumphed since you will go over 5 to 6 silos at about 50 feet up. Smaller people will need to drop down a few feet lower crossing a couple of the silos where it narrows a little. The movement in the X section is reletively easy and most fit people accustomed to stemming should be able to complete the X section if they are willing to take the risk of being up that high. I have been through with someone 5 foot 1 inch tall who has made it through the X section so height is not a requirement here. If you have some people doing the X section and some people bypassing; those on the rim can walk along with the X travelers for the last portion of the X section. (Data by bluugnome.com)",

This section starts narrow as you downclimb through and over a few silos where you will have short sections where you will be 10 to 15 feet off the deck. Then under a natural bridge; through one skinny squeeze spot that can be climbed up over about 8 feet if needed. Shortly after is one other tight spot to go over about 5 feet up or laydown and squirm under if sand is low and you are not too large. After the second squeeze spot the canyon gives way to a long sand bottomed corridor of a few hundred feet long with scenic undulating walls and may have more wading to waist deep if full.
