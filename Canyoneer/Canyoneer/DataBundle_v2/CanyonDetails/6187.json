  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><ul>\n<li>The \"II\" on the ACA rating given to this canyon is based on the\napproach for the middle gorge. Dropping in from the top makes this a\nfull day trip.</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Rock Creek is a bit unique in just how filled it is with giant\nboulders. While sometimes I feel like this could be detrimental to a\ncanyon's quality, it actually turns out to be really cool in Rock Creek\nand makes for some very interesting sections. Also the center gorge\nwhere Rock Creek makes an obvious tight bend is a short, but extremely\nhigh quality section of canyon.</p>\n<p>Rock Creek could be divided into sections: (It would be reasonable to\ndo all three in one day)</p>\n<p>There is a lower section, which can be accessed on its own, although\nunfortunately does not have a whole lot of excitement, and can all be\ndownclimbed, with lots of boulders and few jumps.</p>\n<p>Above this is a the middle section which has long beautiful pools and\na large double falls toward the bottom, and a tight impressive gorge\nthat makes for the most exciting section above this. You can hike to the\ntop of this as well. While this section is tight, and poses potential\nproblems with high flows, somebody has put in a lot of effort to install\nsome cables, that can be followed along ledges that allow you to bypass\nany potential problem areas.</p>\n<p>Further up is an upper section that is also well worth the effort and\ncontains a number of interesting boulder filled sections, including one\nnarrow slot formed between a wall and a broken slab that is reminiscent\nof Kaiser Creek.</p>\n<p>I'm not sure if it's worth going higher than that. It would\ndefinitely require substantially more effort and there is likely not too\nmuch in the way of exciting canyon there.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>Accessing the lower section: Drive or hike up the first couple sets\nof small switchbacks to a green gate on the left (before the main road\ntakes off straight east for a while). You could park here, and walk a\nshort distance up the steep rocky road past this green gate. Up canyon a\ncut and an obvious trail, which narrows up, and has a ladder, going\nupstream toward a popular swimming hole. You can descend from here (not\nreally worth it), or head upstream, boulder hopping your way to the base\nof the large waterfall (~80ft) that goes around either side of a\nboulder. To get there, you will want to cross the creek twice, and get\nall the way up to the bottom of the gorge, maybe 50 feet below the\nwaterfall, where a steep path cuts up to the right and to a ledge that\ntraverses along the top.</p>\n<p>Middle gorge section: Continue boulder hopping upstream past this\nwaterfall. I think progress is easier if you stay to the right. Go all\nthe way until you see the last, gorgeous pool, of this section. Up to\nthe left you can find a small trail that follows the base of the cliff.\nAfter climbing a ways, the route makes a fairly obvious turn up to the\nright, and begins a section of exposed class III climbing. Some solid\ntrees in here help. An easy slab traverse off the top of this scramble\nbrings you to the continuation of the small faint path, and around the\nridge to the downstream side of the cable tyrolean traverse. You can\nrappel in here.</p>\n<p>Accessing the upper section: A switchbacking road that heads North of\n70 at Rock Creek provides access to the canyon. It can be driven if you\nwould like to shuttle, but hiking it is not a problem either as long as\nyou start earlier as it is well in the sun. The road is very narrow,\nsteep, and sandy with sharp switchbacks. We made it halfway up in my\noutback, but probably could have made it 95% of the way to the upper\nsection if we were motivated. A small 4WD pickup would have no problems\nuntil the final switchback which has big ruts. A larger truck might be\ntoo big to squeeze up the road. There is parking at most of the\nswitchbacks.</p>\n<p>Upper section: Pass the green gate and follow the road as it cuts off\neast, then does a whole bunch more switchbacks up over 2000 ft total.\nThe final switchback is very rutted and you might want to park before.\nYou'll get to the top at a sort of pass. Drop down the other side of the\npass and stay to the right side of this drainage to get below some\nfairly thick manzanita staying in the pines. Before the drainage drops\noff steeply, cut off to the right to get on top of the ridge. We found a\nnice game trail that took us to a gully that drops straight north into\nthe canyon. This gully kind of sucks, but seems like the best way down.\nOverall the route is not bad.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>Upper section:</p>\n<p>Where you hit the creek you can boulder hop on dry land down to a\nnice bed rock canyon where you will suit up. Soon after is a narrow slot\nwhich can be downclimbed with some high stemming, and would cause some\nproblems with higher flow. Below here is a section with a large slab on\nthe left and boulders on the right. Climbing down the left is easy, but\nthe creek cutting to the right would be awesome to explore. More of the\nsame continues, choosing between staying high and climbing through\nboulders down to the middle gorge. We only found one rappel necessary in\nthis section.</p>\n<p>Middle gorge: Walls head up and the boulders get bigger through here.\nYou can climb down into a right crack where a slab slid off to the left,\nand the water finds a sieve to drop through the middle of. Scrambling\naround out of this crack will take you to the top of a cable tyrolean\ntraverse, which can be used to bypass high flows. We rappelled off of\nhere, down two stages. A cascading falls into a pothole past here can be\nrappelled or bypassed then jumped on the left. If flows are high, you\ncan follow a ledge to the left, and rappel down off a tree to the pool\nat the base of the gorge. But more fun, is to jump the next small drop,\nthen the next exciting rappel here bolted off a boulder in the center.\nYou can rappel two stages, bringing you down to the large ending pool at\nthe bottom.</p>\n<p>The canyon opens up downstream a bit, and the 120 foot falls follows,\nrappelled off the middle of a large boulder off of 3 bolts, followed by\nsome beautiful pools, a fun slide, and the trail exiting left.</p>\n<p>Lower section: Boulder hopping and a couple jumps.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>You'll come out right near the railroad bridge at the bottom.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a\nhref=\"http://www.canyoneering.info/CA/NorCal/RockCreek/index2.html\">CanyoneeringInfo</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n",
