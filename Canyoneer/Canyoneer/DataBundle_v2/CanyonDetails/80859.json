  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>Hyatt Creek is a fun little half day trip for those in the\nMcCall/Riggins area. The hike out along hazard creek is pleasant and\nscenic. The slog from the trail turnoff to the top of the falls is\npretty rough, but you get two awesome rappels right down the face of a\ncool waterfall as a reward. We scouted the falls at the end of May and\nthey were ripping. Much too high to descend in my opinion. By the middle\nof August the flow was super tame and refreshing.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>Park at the Hazard Creek trailhead. Follow the trail for about 1.75\nmiles until you see Hyatt creek falls coming in on your left. (We chose\nto mountain bike this section which saved us about an hour of hiking\ntotal. We stashed our bikes at the turn off to the falls) This is the\nroute. Cross where the creek crosses the trail and soon after you will\nsee a social trail going towards the base of the falls. Follow that\ntrail until it starts to disappear. If you are looking towards the falls\nyou will see a steep ramp on the right side of the falls. That is your\nroute to the top. Route find up the ramp to the top of the falls. There\nis a lot of loose rock in this section so be careful. Once you get to\nthe top there is a good place to downclimb to the creek near the top of\nthe first drop.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>Anchor from a big burned tree right at the top of the first falls.\nThis drop took up most of our 200 ft rope. This rappel will deposit you\non big shelf in the middle of the waterfall. The waterfall is super\nslippery and there is some potential for rockfall so be careful. There\nis plenty of room to walk around and you can even bail out here if you\nneed to. We chose to descend the DCL half of the lower falls. We girth\nhitched a fallen log for our anchor. This drop is about 125 ft. This\ndrop is also very slick. It deposits you at the base of the waterfall.\nYou get much more wet on the second rappel than the first. Follow a\nsocial trail/bushwhack back to where you left the main hazard creek\ntrail. The rocks at the bottom of the waterfall are also extremely\nslick. Both rappels put you right in the flow which felt great on a hot\nday.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>Follow hazard creek trail back to your car.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n",
