{"description":"<div class=\"mw-content-ltr mw-parser-output\" lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><p>Razzle Dazzle creek is an unnamed tributary of Davis Creek in the Gifford Pinchot National Forest near Randle, WA. It is a short and sweet alternative to Davis when flows are running high. Its normally low flow, easy approach, straightforward descent, and non-committing nature makes it a great beginner and off-season route.\n<\/p>\n<ul><li>Watershed: 0.3mi^2.<\/li><\/ul>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>To get to the creek, drive up FR 63 as if you were going to run Davis. The road crosses the creek about 2.8 miles in. Park anywhere along the road here. The final falls is visible from the road. \n<\/p>\n<ul><li>Update 2023: Close to the falls are a couple of small rock slides. It's passable, but larger vehicles squeaking through might lose some paint.<\/li><\/ul>\n<p>The approach begins just around the bend in the road past the creek. The approach is straightforward and parallels the creek for ~0.25mi, gaining ~500' of elevation. Pass numerous burrows of ground-dwelling varmints. You'll likely get views of the upper set of falls on your way up. Drop in to the creek at around 2,600'.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>DCR = Down Canyon Right\nDCL = Down Canyon Left\n<\/p>\n<ul><li>R1: 90' two-stage rappel from a rock creek center.
