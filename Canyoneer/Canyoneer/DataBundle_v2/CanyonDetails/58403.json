  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>Razzle Dazzle creek is an unnamed tributary of Davis Creek in the\nGifford Pinchot National Forest near Randle, WA. It is a short and sweet\nalternative to Davis when flows are running high. Its normally low flow,\neasy approach, straightforward descent, and non-committing nature makes\nit a great beginner and off-season route.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Watershed: 0.3mi^2.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>To get to the creek, drive up FR 63 as if you were going to run\nDavis. The road crosses the creek about 2.8 miles in. Park anywhere\nalong the road here. The final falls is visible from the road.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Update 2023: Close to the falls are a couple of small rock slides.\nIt's passable, but larger vehicles squeaking through might lose some\npaint.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The approach begins just around the bend in the road past the creek.\nThe approach is straightforward and parallels the creek for ~0.25mi,\ngaining ~500' of elevation. Pass numerous burrows of ground-dwelling\nvarmints. You'll likely get views of the upper set of falls on your way\nup. Drop in to the creek at around 2,600'.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>DCR = Down Canyon Right DCL = Down Canyon Left</p>\n<ul>\n<li>R1: 90' two-stage rappel from a rock creek center. Check the rock\ncarefully as it will rock from side-to-side; it appeared stable in the\ndirection of pull.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>R2: 100' two-stage rappel from a rock cairn DCR at water level.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>R3: 75' DCR from a small tree about 20' up the hillside.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>R4: 150' from a large cedar DCL.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There may be more falls further up the creek. It may be possible to\naccess the full route from above via road but has not been verified.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>What exit? Walk down the creek to your car (30s).</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<p>None.</p>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n<p>This canyon was first descended by Ryan Ernst, Haruka-James Clay\nLipscomb, Barry Specht, and Jake Huddleston on 2/15/2020.</p>\n",
