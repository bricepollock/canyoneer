{"name":"Fries Creek Canyon","rappelCountMax":6,"description":"<div class=\"mw-content-ltr mw-parser-output\" lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><p>Right in Squamish. Start is just across from Fishermans Beach. A nice few drops, but probably not worth the 4 hour approach hike with bush wacking steep loamy terrain. Very pretty.\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>There is a reasonable good trail starting at 49.75642, -123.15861 which works its way up several noses. It travels under the power lines mostly following Fries Creek. At about 300m elevation the trail goes to the lake. After this you mostly bushwack back to the ridge. There are some old logging roads which make this easier for a bit, but then you bushwack to cross the tributary coming in from the south and follow the game trails up an up. Traverse around to the start of the canyon at about 437m elevation.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>The first descent was done using mostly natural anchors. The 2nd last drop, which is just a little over 30m, was bolted with 2 bolts canyon left. You will need to set up a handline off a natural anchor to safely get to the bolts which give a good low abrasion line down the falls.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>once all of the drops have been completed, walk down canyon for a couple of hundred metres until you find a way up the steep sides on canyon right. The trail is up there, you just have to find it.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Red_tape\">Red tape<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Beta_sites\">Beta sites<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>First descent, Michael Henson and Jon Obst, October 8th 2022.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Background\">Background<\/h2><\/div>\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nParsed by mw‐api‐ext.codfw.main‐6779cc57fc‐9nn7z\nCached time: 20240914192115\nCache expiry: 2592000\nReduced expiry: false\nComplications: [show‐toc]\nCPU time usage: 0.005 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.006 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 21\/1000000\nPost‐expand include size: 0\/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 0\/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 2\/100\nExpensive parser function count: 0\/500\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0\/20\nUnstrip post‐expand size: 0\/5000000 bytes\nNumber of Wikibase entities loaded: 0\/400\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%    0.000      1 -total\n-->\n<\/div>","vehicle":null,"riskRating":"PG","permit":"No","geojson":null,"url":"https:\/\/ropewiki.com\/Fries_Creek_Canyon","version":"1fae6332c868828c051b81c3e483bc436a3eaee9d76a5679b3fa5e7ab4292334","months":["Sep"],"timeRating":"IV","technicalRating":3,"rappelCountMin":6,"shuttleSeconds":null,"id":73857,"latitude":49.7394,"longitude":-123.1882,"quality":0,"rappelLongestMeters":35,"waterRating":"C1"}
