Convenient road access and a friendly trail lead to the base of exquisite and popular Murhut Falls. The descent begins with an exciting rappel in the full flow and becomes quite intriguing further downstream. The atmosphere intensifies in a narrow hall with a logjam strainer and a siphon. Abundant cascades further on offer some enjoyable downclimbing. An impressive waterfall with a large boulder pile and wide cascades at its base is a grand prelude to the aquamarine waters of the Duckabush River.\n<\/p><p>Watershed: 2.8mi^2. Highest point in the watershed is ~4500ft elevation.\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>From the trailhead, a large pullout on the north side of the road, follow the signed trail 0.8mi to Murhut Falls.  The view from bench is the checkpoint.\n<\/p><p>To get to the top of the big falls, head up the steep wooded slopes behind the upper viewpoint. Bear gradually right as you gain elevation until well above the falls. If it's not easy, you're in the wrong place. Head downhill to the creek just upstream of the waterfall. It's a little steep, but easy, as the forest is very open and there is hardly any brush.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Beta has been updated to reflect current conditions as of the 2024 season opener. \n<\/p><p><i>Murhut Falls<\/i> (R1 &amp; R2).  Take care of those below if throwing your ropes \/ rope bags and yell <b>ROPE<\/b> loudly.\n<\/p>\n<ul><li>R1: 130' (DCL - tree). The anchor is webbing around a tree trunk at ground level. There is a convenient platform 5' below for the anchor manager and for passengers to get on rappel. An easy downclimb but recommended to attached a long safety lanyard as it may be slippery and there is exposure. At the bottom of the falls there is a grand ramada directly behind the base of the falls and a small cave on the bottom left.<\/li>\n<li>R2: 40' (DCR - fallen log). It is suggested to use a retrievable anchor as these fall are in sight of the trail. There is a bypass DCL. The viewpoint on the trail is just below R2.<\/li><\/ul>\n<p>Continue downstream. Two small waterfalls can be downclimbed DCR.\n<\/p>\n<ul><li>R3: 25' (Center Right - log) into shallow pool with a large strainer spanning the downstream side.

Downclimb 100' through log debris and boulders DCL.<\/li>\n<li>R4: 40' (DCL -tree)<\/li>\n<li>R5: 75' (Center - log) low-angle. May be possible to downclimb in low-flow.<\/li>\n<li>R6: 80' (DCR - tree). Vertical falls. Rappeller's option to go in direct flow or stay on the side. Excellent opportunity for a guided rappel by anchoring off a massive log for the bottom anchor. In high flow, this rappel ends in a deep pool with a possible hydraulic. Bypass available DCR.<\/li>\n<li>R7: 25' (DCL - tree) into small gorge, deep enough for a dynamic disconnect. Optional short technical jump. In high flow there may be a hydaulic.

Check water levels before jumping.\n<\/p><p>There is an early exit DCR if you want to avoid the steep bushwack climb up from the river.\n<\/p>\n<ul><li>R9: 50' (DCL - tree) appears to be a 100' drop from the top but the bottom 50' is an easy downclimb right, left, or center. The tree is near the edge and not the strongest looking, a meat anchor back up is recommended.<\/li><\/ul>\n<p>There is another early exit DCR shortly below the bottom of R9 if you want to avoid half of the steep bushwack up from the river. \n<\/p><p>To continue, creek walk and downclimb a distance of about 500' to the river.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>From the confluence of Murhut Creek and Duckabush River, exit the canyon DCR. Bushwhack up the slope, trending southeast. Ascend the slope for about 200ft until you encounter an old logging road grade (described as FR 032 on FS topo maps from 2016). Follow this mostly level grade east until it eventually intersects FR2530.  The grade is overgrown but a use trail is developing. The overgrown road hike takes about 30 minutes to get to Lower Parking. \n<\/p>\n<ul><li>Alternately, you can float\/ creek walk down the Duckabush River to the bridge if you placed a shuttle vehicle at Lowest Parking.  At high flow the river swim is not recommended. At low flow the river swim is not recommended due to foot entrapment. <b>SOMEONE ON THE TEAM SHOULD BE TRAINED IN SWIFTWATER RESCUE<\/b> if swimming the river. Foot entrapment is the number one cause of river fatalities.<\/li><\/ul>\n<p>The best thing about Murhut Canyon may be the after-canyon swimming hole at the bridge. There is a rope swing and jumping platforms from 10' to 20'. A great place to cool off and clean off your wetsuit and gear.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Red_tape\">Red tape<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>None.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Beta_sites\">Beta sites<\/h2><\/div>\n<ul><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20210527212206\/www.canyoneeringnorthwest.com\/MurhutCreek\/Murhut_Creek.php\">CanyoneeringNorthwest.com (archive.org)<\/a> &#160;: Murhut Creek<\/li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https:\/\/www.fs.usda.gov\/Internet\/FSE_DOCUMENTS\/stelprdb5359348.pdf\">Murhut Falls Trail Info #828<\/a><\/li><\/ul>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Background\">Background<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>If camping the night befo\n<\/p>\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nParsed by mw‐api‐ext.codfw.main‐6779cc57fc‐c62wm\nCached time: 20240914191954\nCache expiry: 2592000\nReduced expiry: false\nComplications: [show‐toc]\nCPU time usage: 0.006 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.008 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 21\/1000000\nPost‐expand include size: 0\/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 0\/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 2\/100\nExpensive parser function count: 0\/500\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0\/20\nUnstrip post‐expand size: 0\/5000000 bytes\nNumber of Wikibase entities loaded: 0\/400\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%    0.000      1 -total\n-->\n<\/div><div class=\"mw-content-ltr mw-parser-output\" lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><p>re or after Collins Campground on Duckabush Road is 1 mile from the bridge and has several nice riverside sites.
