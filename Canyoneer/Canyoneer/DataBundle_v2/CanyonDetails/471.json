It may have lost the anchor material that was already very sparse in 2017.

The gate has a combination lock. If you contact the ranger station to inquire, they may be able to give you the code to open the gate. The trail is good for 4x4 capable vehicles, but the steepness may present some challenges to vehicles that are not in good shape.\n<\/p><p>If the gate is locked, or you don't have a shuttle vehicle, you can follow the fire road up the ridge, on foot for a fairly steep hike which winds around the ridge until a small pond at the top.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Right by the small pond at the top of the ridge, is a trail that leads into the gully. Follow the gully down into an area which requires some mild bushwacking. You may pass some small orange markers tied to shrubs. Continue on and you will reach a section where the bushes have grown togethor into a type of tunnel you must duck and crawl through. There may or may not be a trail cairn. Continue on further and it begins to open up from a shrubby, dirt laden area into a much wider area with tall trees and boulders. Downclimb and hike down canyon for about 30-45 minutes until the first rappel.\n<\/p><p>R1 - 250' Off a slightly overhanging tree canyon left. If you want to take this as a 200' rather than a 250', you may use a series of ledges to the canyon left. The ledges are exposed and rockfall can ricochet quite far from the canyon wall, so use caution when rappelling and belaying.\n<\/p><p>R2 - 130' high off the tree, set back in the watercourse.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Follow a well marked path canyon left, that leads up out of the last waterfall and towards the campground.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Red_tape\">Red tape<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>A metal gate blocks a potential 4x4 shuttle road.
