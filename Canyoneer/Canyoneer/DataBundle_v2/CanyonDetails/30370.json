{"permit":"No","shuttleSeconds":null,"longitude":1.302,"id":30370,"description":"<div class=\"mw-content-ltr mw-parser-output\" lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><p>This is an outstanding via ferrata, one of the best in Spain. It is quite long having many vertical sections, a bridge, and a point where you span from one wall to the other across a gorge. Due to this span which requires a long stride, children and other people that are short cannot finish the via ferrata, at least not without any assistance. Most people 5'4\" or taller (estimated) should be able to make the span on their own. Shorter people, with assistance, can probably make the span because the via ferrata has a cable that extends out that the climber can connect their safety carabiner to, in order to still be protected. The views of the reservoir below the via ferrata are stunning.\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>To find, navigate in Google Maps to the parking area named 'Via Ferrata Regina Peramola' at 42.11756, 1.3034. This is on the left side of the road at km marker 148 (some websites incorrectly state the parking is at km marker 149). From here, you hike up the drainage for a couple hundred meters until the trail splits -- the return trail is what continues up the drainage, but you want to take the split to the right up the hill. The trail is well traveled from here to the start of the route at 42.1224, 1.302.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>The start of the route has the bottom 6m (20') of cable and rungs chopped away, but it is relatively easy to climb the cliff to the right and traverse over to the rungs. There may be a rope hanging from the bottom rung. It is easier to climb the cliff to the right and use the rope as a handline, than it would be to batman directly up the rope to the first rung. The climbing is not particularly difficult, but some people might want a safety belay for this.\n<\/p><p>Map:\n<style data-mw-deduplicate=\"TemplateStyles:r1062633282\">@media all and (max-width:720px){.mw-parser-output .content .thumb>div:not(.thumbinner){display:flex;justify-content:center;flex-wrap:wrap;align-content:flex-start;flex-direction:column}}body.skin-vector .mw-parser-output div.thumb>div:not(.thumbinner){font-size:94%;text-align:center;overflow:hidden;min-width:100px}body.skin-minerva .mw-parser-output div.thumb>div:not(.thumbinner){margin:0 auto;max-width:100%!important}<\/style> \n<\/p>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\">\n<div style=\"display:table;\">\n<span class=\"mw-default-size\" typeof=\"mw:Error mw:File\/Frameless\">\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>Crux move with a 5'7\" young woman spanning the gap:\n<link rel=\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\" href=\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1062633282\"> \n<\/p>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\">\n<div style=\"display:table;\">\n<span class=\"mw-default-size\" typeof=\"mw:Error mw:File\/Frameless\">\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Red_tape\">Red tape<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Some websites report that this via ferrata is closed, but as of Aug 2018 the safety cable was in good shape the entire length of the via ferrata. There are obvious areas where old damaged cable had been recently replaced, and the whole route was well protected. And there are no posted signs at the parking or at the start of the route that say it is closed (other via ferratas that are closed are usually posted). In addition, the via ferrata is in a very remote area and climbers are not likely to be seen.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Beta_sites\">Beta sites<\/h2><\/div>\n<ul><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http:\/\/translate.google.com\/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=es&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http:\/\/deandar.com\/ferratas\/via-ferrata-regina\">DeAndar.com (Translated)<\/a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http:\/\/deandar.com\/ferratas\/via-ferrata-regina\">(Original)<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http:\/\/latrencanous.com\/ferratas\/regina\/topo.pdf\">Latrencanous.com<\/a> &#160;: Via Ferrata Regina<\/li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http:\/\/climbing7.wordpress.com\/2010\/09\/11\/la-regina-de-peramola-oliana-catalunya-espagne-\">Climbing7<\/a> &#160;: Via Ferrata La Regina de Peramola<\/li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http:\/\/descensodebarrancos.com\/ferratas\/regina\/regina.html\">DescensoDeBarrancos.com<\/a> &#160;: Via ferrata Regina o de Oliana<\/li><\/ul>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Background\">Background<\/h2><\/div>\n\n\n<\/div>","riskRating":null,"rappelLongestMeters":null,"timeRating":null,"version":"34247984863664bb9135cc7d0463158fac8604e3b77d0ef2e6a5a76317ebcd86","quality":5,"url":"https:\/\/ropewiki.com\/Via_Ferrata_Regina","latitude":42.1224,"months":[],"geojson":null,"vehicle":null,"waterRating":null,"technicalRating":null,"name":"Via Ferrata Regina","rappelCountMin":null,"rappelCountMax":null}
