  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>This canyon drops through Entrada sandstone then alabaster (gypsum)\nwith a short technical section in each interspersed with more open\ncanyon. you then exit by climbing up to the ridge LUC and bypassing the\ntechnical sections then following the canyon back up to the top.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>easy walk with some light bushwhacking and scrambling over deadfall\nin a gradually narrowing canyon.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>the first obstacle is a 30' or LAPAR/meat anchor. could also build\nsome kind of anchor from the rocks in the hanging pothole in the center\nof this. continue downclimbing through the sandstone until: 1st\nmandatory rap: 20' from a cairn. this gets you out of the sandstone\nslot. after this the canyon is open for a couple of hundred feet and\nthen slots up again through the alabaster (gypsum) section next rap: 10'\noff a log canyon center (easy to ghost) final rap (can be\ndownclimbed/jumped): 7' off a big rock or choke point. we retrieved our\nanchor material from the bottom</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>after the last rap in the gypsum, take your harness off and climb up\na steep ridge RDC. follow this up until the drainage indicated on the\nkml drops back into the canyon above the sandstone technical section.\nfrom here you can climb back up in the drainage. there are some class 4\nor maybe easy class 5 moves that can be bypassed by climbing out of the\ncanyon RUC and rapping back in off of a tree (better to just have a\ndecent climber that can assist).</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><img src=\"rwl_en.png\" title=\"rwl_en.png\" alt=\"rwl_en.png\" /><a\nhref=\"http://dougscottart.com/hobbies/SlotCanyons/Deadman.htm\">Doug\nScott's New Mexico Slot Canyons</a> : Deadman Canyon</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n",
