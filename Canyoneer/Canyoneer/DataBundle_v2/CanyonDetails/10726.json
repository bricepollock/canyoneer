pothole in the center of this.\ncontinue downclimbing through the sandstone until:\n1st mandatory rap: 20' from a cairn. this gets you out of the sandstone slot. \nafter this the canyon is open for a couple of hundred feet and then slots up again through the alabaster (gypsum) section\nnext rap: 10' off a log canyon center (easy to ghost)\nfinal rap (can be downclimbed\/jumped): 7' off a big rock or choke point. we retrieved our anchor material from the bottom\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>after the last rap in the gypsum, take your harness off and climb up a steep ridge RDC. follow this up until the drainage indicated on the kml drops back into the canyon above the sandstone technical section. from here you can climb back up in the drainage. there are some class 4 or maybe easy class 5 moves that can be bypassed by climbing out of the canyon RUC and rapping back in off of a tree (better to just have a decent climber that can assist).\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Red_tape\">Red tape<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Beta_sites\">Beta sites<\/h2><\/div>\n<ul><li><a
