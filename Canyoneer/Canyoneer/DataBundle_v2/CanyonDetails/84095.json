  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>A not-so-great hike, to a not-so-great canyon. In comparison to Hot\nLoop this route requires more effort for very little pay off. The two\ndrops are short and could possibly be downclimbed or bypassed in dry\nconditions. The route starts off pretty clean but gets brushy as you\ncontinue.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>Start at Jacks Canyon Th and hike up, and across Horse Mesa to the\ndrop in.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>Connect with Jacks Canyon trail and follow it back to your\nvehicle.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n<p>We believe we were the first to explore the top section of the canyon\non 1/22/2024. An amputated elk skull and man-made dam at the bottom\nslickrock section show signs of previous exploration. - Eric Moorcroft,\nCooper Smith, Jason Firstowski</p>\n",
