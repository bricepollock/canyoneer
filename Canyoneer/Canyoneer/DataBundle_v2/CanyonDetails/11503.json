Water level must be at or below the mark indicated in the guide book.

Biggest danger in the canyon was the undercut on CR of big pool. Do not get swept under. Upon getting off rappel, jump off ledge straight into middle of pool at edge of boil and swim hard straight across - do not head right or let yourself get carried to the back right wall. If pulled into the wall and undercut keep feet up against wall lying on back and use arms to steer down stream.\n2 hours for a proficient group.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>20 minutes beautiful hike down calm end of stream and across Makarora River and wheatin fields.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Red_tape\">Red tape<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Beta_sites\">Beta sites<\/h2><\/div>\n<ul><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http:\/\/kiwicanyons.org\/?p=1540\">KiwiCanyons.org<\/a> &#160;: Ore Stream<\/li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http:\/\/canyonchronicles.com\/canyoning-ore-creek?kmlidxna\">CanyonChronicles.com<\/a> &#160;: Ore Creek<\/li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http:\/\/icopro.org\/canyon\/view\/id\/174\">Icopro.org<\/a> &#160;: Ore Stream<\/li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http:\/\/descente-canyon.com\/canyoning\/canyon-description\/23823\">Descente-Canyon.com<\/a> &#160;: Ore Stream<\/li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http:\/\/icopro.org\/canyon\/view\/id\/401\">Icopro.org<\/a> &#160;: Ore Stream<\/li><\/ul>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Background\">Background<\/h2><\/div>\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nParsed by mw‐api‐ext.codfw.main‐6779cc57fc‐9vsr7\nCached time: 20240914192014\nCache expiry: 2592000\nReduced expiry: false\nComplications: [show‐toc]\nCPU time usage: 0.005 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.006 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 21\/1000000\nPost‐expand include size: 0\/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 0\/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 2\/100\nExpensive parser function count: 0\/500\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0\/20\nUnstrip post‐expand size: 0\/5000000 bytes\nNumber of Wikibase entities loaded: 0\/400\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%    0.000      1 -total\n-->\n<\/div>","geojson":{"type":"FeatureCollection","features":[{"geometry":{"coordinates":[[169.244064,-44.176243,0]],"type":"Point"},"properties":{"name":"Start"},"type":"Feature"},{"properties":{"name":"End"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[[169.254074,-44.183605,0]]}},{"properties":{"name":"Parking"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[[169.26178,-44.187309,0]]},"type":"Feature"}]},"rappelLongestMeters":25,"longitude":169.2514}
