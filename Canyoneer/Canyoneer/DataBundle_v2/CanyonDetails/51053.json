  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>Identified and expecting a canyoneering First Descent, but when\narriving in the canyon, we found fresh anchors recently put in. I had\npreviously posted some info for this canyon when recruiting partners for\nit, so not sure if that was used. We have no idea who the group was that\njust went through this canyon before we got there. There is no beta or a\nposting for this canyon in Ropewiki by anyone so far. Maybe the party\nwill come forth to be identified. Put in a generic (temporary) name to\nsee if it has been named by this earlier party.</p>\n<p>UPDATE: 12-14-19: Found that the First Descent was done by Rick Kent\nand team 1-23-10. In the statement above, there was another party that\nran the canyon in front of Scott Swaney's team, and still unknown who it\nwas at this time. Rick Kent's trip was almost ten years earlier.</p>\n<p>Rick had named the canyon in 2010 Desperation Canyon. Never has been\nput on any public canyoneering beta site</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<p><a\nhref=\"https://www.facebook.com/scott.swaney/media_set?set=a.10156155605047930.1073742448.668617929&amp;type=3\">https://www.facebook.com/scott.swaney/media_set?set=a.10156155605047930.1073742448.668617929&amp;type=3</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n<p>This report is for a descent of this canyon on 2-18-18 led by Scott\nSwaney &amp; Team (See above TRIP REPORT).
