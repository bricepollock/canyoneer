  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>Bottleneck Canyon is a short and sweet route in the Wynoochee River\nValley on the Olympic Peninsula. Blink and you’ll miss it as you drive\nby, the creek drains a very small catchment on the east side of the\nvalley, with surprisingly good bang for your buck. The only real\nentrance fee is a short but annoying bushwhack through some dense\nvegetation with a great many fallen and rotten logs to navigate. The\napproach will soon be forgotten as you descend a rapid fire set of small\nbut scenic falls and end up right back at the road where you\nstarted.</p>\n<p>Fast groups could easily combine this canyon with Clark Creek further\nup the valley for a full day of canyoning. Flows are known to become\nquite low in both canyons by mid to late summer. This canyon may also be\na good winter route due to its low elevation, easy access, and small\ncatchment.</p>\n<p>This canyon requires rigging a traverse line to access an exposed\nanchor. Groups should be familiar with how to rig retrievable traverse\nlines. <strong>Please do not leave fixed traverse lines in\ncanyons!</strong> They are unnecessary and potentially unsafe as they\noften cannot be fully inspected for damage prior to use.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Watershed: 0.65mi^2. Highest point in the drainage is 3900ft\nelevation.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p><strong>Driving Directions</strong>: From Olympia, take Hwy 12 from\nOlympia to the town of Montesano. This is the last stop for fuel and\nother supplies before heading north. From Montesano, take Wynoochee\nValley Road north for 33 miles until it abruptly turns to gravel and\nbecomes NF-2312. Continue another 6.8 miles until the creek for\nBottleneck Canyon appears on the right side of the road. Find a suitable\nspot to park along the side of the road.</p>\n<p><strong>Canyon Approach</strong>: From the creek, walk up the road\n(north) and look for a suitable place to cut into the dense forest.\nThere is no official route here. Some trimming and flagging for future\napproaches may be helpful at some point. (If a decent approach route is\nestablished, it would be great for someone to record a track and update\nthe KML map in the near future). The first rappel is at approximately\n1,400' elevation.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p><strong>DCR</strong> = Down Canyon Right</p>\n<p><strong>DCL</strong> = Down Canyon Left</p>\n<p><strong>R1</strong>: DCL - 50’ From a tree. This anchor allows you to\nrappel in the flow DCR through a curved chute, or the dry side DCL to\navoid the flow.</p>\n<p><strong>R2</strong>: Center canyon - 25’ from a log.</p>\n<p>Downclimb: Directly after R2, downclimb into a small pool. This\ndownclimb may be tricky for some, so a human anchor may be necessary for\nsome members of the group.</p>\n<p><strong>R3</strong>: DCR - 25’ from an old log. The log is quite old\nand rotten and caution should be taken. Another option: use a human\nanchor to send a teammate or two down. They can then spot other members\nof the group when downclimbing.</p>\n<p><strong>R4</strong>: DCR - 20’ traverse line from unlinked bolts to a\n60’ rappel from a bolted anchor. <strong>Please leave the traverse line\nbolts unlinked, and do not leave a fixed traverse line</strong>. Groups\nshould be familiar with how to rig a retrievable traverse line. A\ntraverse line might not be necessary in low water.</p>\n<p><strong>R5</strong>: DCL - 10' from log. Below: downclimb through a\nlogjam.</p>\n<p><strong>R6</strong>: DCR - 70’ from a tree. This rappel requires\nnavigating a pile of logs that have collected at the bottom of the\nrappel. Care should be taken both during the rappel and also the rope\npull, as the rope is likely to get stuck in the log debris.</p>\n<p><strong>R7</strong>: DCR - 60' from a tree. The watercourse splits at\nthe top of the falls here, with most or all of the flow on canyon left.\nThis rappel line takes the lower flow/dry side of the falls.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>Walk the road back to your vehicles.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<p>The northern end of Wynoochee Valley is closed seasonally from Oct 1\nthrough April 30 and is gated at approximately 47.44722, -123.55027 on\nFR 2270. (Oddly in 2023, the season was extended until November 1.)\nAccess is still legal on foot or by mountain bike. Bottleneck is about\n1mi, +200ft further up the road.</p>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n<p>This canyon was first descended on 5/31/21 by Stephanie Moe, Gretchen\nMallari, Zach Kiefer, and Jake Huddleston. The creek itself is unnamed\non topo maps, so “Bottleneck” canyon was agreed on as a name for several\nreasons. On the final sequence, it was observed that vehicles often\nrapidly slowed down or even had to reverse in order to get a good look\nat the falls, creating a traffic jam. The first descent team also sent\nup a celebratory beer for the last person on the last pitch, so a beer\nrelated name seemed appropriate. Bottoms up!</p>\n",
