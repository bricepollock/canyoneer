class=\"mw-content-ltr mw-parser-output\" lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><p>Remarkably accessible Zion-esque mini-slots in Southern California! Three small drainages cut steeply through a sloping slab of coarse sandstone providing short twisty slots with some nice fluted dryfall rappels and neat downclimbs. A little scrub bashing through the drainage below the slots but no poison oak seen. The canyons are technically not too difficult and short and may be suitable for beginners as long as there is at least one experienced individual. It is a great place to practice teamwork, meat anchoring, partner-assisted downclimbs, retrievable anchors like fiddlesticking, and potentially sandtraps. The sandstone is extremely soft (not suitable for permanent anchors) so be prepared to create anchors. Knowledge of meat anchor techniques and a capable last person climber will save a lot of time, as well as linking together drops (don't pull the rope before evaluating your next move downcanyon!).\n<\/p><p>Recommended: 200ft rope. Work gloves and good traction shoes for the abrasive sandstone. Adequate webbing for anchors. A fiddlestick and sandtrap extend anchor options. A folding saw for scrub in the drainage would improve the route.\n<\/p><p>Below is a description for Sauce and Slice, named as these are in the headwaters of Apple Canyon. Sauce is probably the better of the two canyons and it is suggested to do first. The slots are more pleasant in morning or afternoon when the sun is not beating directly into them. A third canyon is not as deeply incised and remains undescended- if you record a first descent update it here!\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p><b>Driving:<\/b> From the Quail Lake Rd exit of I-5, turn south onto Copco Ave. After just under a mile turn off on the paved side road with a National Forest sign. After a little over a mile turn right (straight) onto the dirt Edison Spring Road. 2WD option: If you have a 2WD vehicle, park at the large cleared road junction 0.75 miles from the pavement. 4WD option: If you have 4WD and are comfortable with slightly rutted deep sand, continue on 0.4 miles to a junction, turn right, and continue on 0.5 miles to park at the pullout near the ridgeline. \n<\/p><p><b>Hiking:<\/b> (1) 2WD option: Follow the road as with the 4WD driving route then turn off to follow the buried pipeline clearing steeply uphill to the ridge. This is steep and loose, but direct. 0.7 miles to reach the ridge. 4WD option: Hike the ridge west 600 feet to join with the 2WD hiking route. (2) Continue along the main ridge (surprisingly good animal trail) about 800 feet then follow the sub-ridge south between Sauce and Slice. Just before you reach the sandstone cliff at the end of the ridge, descend to the bottom of the drainage on the left for Sauce OR to the right for Slice.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p><b>Sauce:<\/b> (1) 8ft downclimb. (2) Double drop of 8ft then 5ft, both of which most should be comfortable downclimbing. (3) 30ft rappel (likely requiring a mid-canyon chockstone pinch webbing anchor an additional 20ft upcanyon). (4) 70ft rappel with a trickier 8ft downclimb beyond. There is an arch on the canyon right wall that can be slung with webbing as anchor; watch your step getting to it. Option 1 is to rappel 90ft through the two obstacles (recommended). Option 2 is to rappel 70ft, then do a partner-assist downclimb. (5) Easy downclimbs end the canyon. Beware spiky yuccas!\n<\/p><p><b>Slice:<\/b> (1) 5 ft downclimb. (2) 20ft rappel. A fiddlestick off the base of the bush on canyon right works well; the bush could also be slung with webbing. (3) 10ft drop. Use of a meat anchor for a rappel and most capable climber downclimbing last should work for most groups. Otherwise build an anchor. (4) 15ft drop. Use of a meat anchor for a rappel and most capable climber downclimbing last should work for most groups. Otherwise build an anchor. (5) 10ft drop. Use of a meat anchor for a rappel and most capable climber downclimbing last (potentially with an assist from below) should work for most groups. Otherwise build an anchor. (6) Two drops of 25ft and 20ft end the canyon. Probably best done as a 90ft rappel using a chockstone pinch. Otherwise rappel 25ft and build an additional anchor for the final drop. The final drop has an awkward narrow start.\n<\/p>\n<style data-mw-deduplicate=\"TemplateStyles:r1062633282\">@media all and (max-width:720px){.mw-parser-output .content .thumb>div:not(.thumbinner){display:flex;justify-content:center;flex-wrap:wrap;align-content:flex-start;flex-direction:column}}body.skin-vector .mw-parser-output div.thumb>div:not(.thumbinner){font-size:94%;text-align:center;overflow:hidden;min-width:100px}body.skin-minerva .mw-parser-output div.thumb>div:not(.thumbinner){margin:0 auto;max-width:100%!important}<\/style> \n<div class=\"thumb tright\">\n<div style=\"display:table;\">\n<span class=\"mw-default-size\" typeof=\"mw:Error mw:File\/Frameless\">\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<link rel=\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\" href=\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1062633282\"> \n<div class=\"thumb tright\">\n<div style=\"display:table;\">\n<span class=\"mw-default-size\" typeof=\"mw:Error mw:File\/Frameless\">\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<link rel=\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\" href=\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1062633282\"> \n<div class=\"thumb tright\">\n<div style=\"display:table;\">\n<span class=\"mw-default-size\" typeof=\"mw:Error mw:File\/Frameless\">\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Sauce and Slice basically share the same exit. From the canyon exit follow the wash down a short distance, working your way through some light bushwhacking. Veer off from the wash to the right following the slight ridge past the sandstone slab, heading towards the powerline tower on the top of the hill. Go underneath the tower and follow the overgrown bulldozer track, either turning off halfway up to approach the next canyon or all the way to the ridge to return to the car.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Red_tape\">Red tape<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>USFS land.
