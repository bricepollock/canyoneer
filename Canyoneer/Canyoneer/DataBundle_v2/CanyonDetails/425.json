Since the gate to the Wildwood parking area is posted as closing at 8 pm, it is tempting to drive into Vogel Flats instead, turn right, follow the road to its end, and park. Only park at the very end of Stonyvale Road. The property along this portion of the road is all privately owned.\n<\/p><p>Find the Stone Canyon Trail and follow it across the watercourse of Big Tujunga and up the mountain.  At 3,015ft elevation, notice the large white rock face in the canyon as the trail turns to the right — this is R5-R7.  After donning helmets, leave the trail at the drop-in at 3380ft elevation and proceed down loose scree for 120 vertical feet along a faint use trail. Full gloves are also advised to protect your hands from yucca spines.\n<\/p><p>Alternately, drop into the canyon earlier, saving 500ft of elevation gain and bypassing the first seven rappels.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>The rappels begin almost immediately.\n<\/p><p><b>R1<\/b>: 78' from two bolts slightly RDC.

This is a two-stage rappel; 65' to the end of the sloping rappel that is probably down climbable in dry conditions, then the remaining distance over the lip is steeper.\n<\/p><p>11\/5\/16 note: if skipping the upper portion of the rappel, the bottom section would be a 30' rappel from a cairn anchor at the bottom over the middle of the rocks. Check to see if there is an anchor here before deciding to skip the upper section of this R12. Also, use caution on the rope pull going RDC in the curve if not going straight. UPDATE: 3\/17\/17 - cairn anchor moved to a lower shelf that avoids putting a curve in the rope pull. Rap from this location is much closer to 30' where cairn described above is more like 50'. It is probably not possible to see the cairn from the top of rap 12; however, one should never depend on these cairns being here as they are in the watercourse and will probably always need remade.\n<\/p><p>R13-R17 are five back-to-back rappels, and some of them may be combined.  If you are short on anchor material and are not familiar or comfortable with releasable anchors, consider your pull strategy carefully for these last five rappels.\n<\/p><p><b>R13<\/b>: ~60' from two bolts LDC\n<\/p><p><b>R14<\/b>: ~40' from a fallen log center of the watercourse.
