As both creeks were canyons, they didn't find their pass\nout and as a result were overdue. Keith Seddon named both creek\n\"Hartleys Mistake Canyons\".</p>\n<p>A party consisting of Keith Maxwell, Rose Adams, Tom Williams, Dave\nNoble, Stephanie Davenport and Bob Sault went down the canyon on 22 Oct\n77.(Kameruka Magazine Vol 16 No 2 - July 78). Photos of the first\ndescent can be seen here: <a\nhref=\"https://www.david-noble.net/canyoning/wolgan/wolgancanyons2.html\">https://www.david-noble.net/canyoning/wolgan/wolgancanyons2.html</a></p>\n<p>Earlier, in 1972, a MMS party of Keith Jones, Barbara Cameron-Smith,\nGreg Retallack and others explored the top of the canyon and descended\nthe first abseil before retreating the same way.</p>\n",
