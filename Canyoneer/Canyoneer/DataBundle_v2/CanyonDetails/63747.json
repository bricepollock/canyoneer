  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>May be one of the cooler canyons within an easy drive from the Front\nRange. It's all ghostable, and would actually be pretty fun at higher\nflows. At lower flows, i.e., most of the time, it's still fun, but more\nfor the views and cool rock. Look for some slides - the rock is very\nsmooth, and there are both wet and dry slides, although all require\neither a spot and confidence sliding into a hard landing or a rope.</p>\n<p>High flows on this creek probably only last a week or two sometime\nbetween April and late May in a good snow year, so if you want to do it\nwhen it's really flowing, you'll need to time things pretty well.</p>\n<p>ETHICS NOTE: This is a ghosting canyon. If you absolutely need to\nleave tat on anchors, expect it to be cleaned off by the next party.\nEvery drop is ghostable and should be ghosted. If you aren't comfortable\nwith standard ghosting techniques, either build up your skillset before\ncoming here or find a friend who is. If you're comfortable using a\nfiddlestick or similar tool, you'll probably have no problem here, with\nthe exception of the last drop (see note below).</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>The track shown on the map is approximate. This area isn't hard at\nall to bushwhack through. The approach essentially involves diverting\nfrom the Dry St. Vrain trailhead and working your way ENE over to the\ncanyon. You may be able to follow game or hunter trails to make life\neasier (look for cairns). Dropping down into the actual stream is a bit\ntricky in places - watch your footing and don't get skewered on a downed\ntree. Once you're in the stream, the going is easy to get to the first\ndrop.</p>\n<p>NOTE ON PARKING: parking is limited at the Dry St. Vrain trailhead,\nand the last 1/2 mile to the trail definitely requires high clearance or\nan absolute lack of care for the condition of your underbody. Parking on\nthe 2WD road is unfortunately very limited, and may piss off locals, so\nbeware.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>The canyon starts with some short warm-up downclimbs, then, you'll\nbreak into some awesome views of Cook Mountain and a few more\nsubstantial drops. Whether you rap or downclimb is up to you, but\nanchors abound. Watch out, while the pegmatite is sticky, the gneiss is\nslick and super slick when wet. Makes for some great rappel slides on\nsome drops when it's even just a little wet, hence the name of the\ncanyon. No jumps, slides into pools, etc., but a very interesting\nlandscape to explore.</p>\n<p>The fun of this canyon is finding your own anchors and leaving no\ntrace as you descend. Anchors are numerous, mainly in the form of large\nlogs, boulders, and big, hearty trees.</p>\n<p>On the first descent, we found the longest rap to be 120 ft, but the\nmax length will depend on the anchors and sequencing you choose, so\nconsider bringing a 200 ft rap rope to be safe.</p>\n<p>NOTE ON THE LAST DROP: The last drop (the one after you boulder hop\nfor a ways, after all the slabby sections of canyon), in particular, was\na puzzle to ghost on the first descent. We ended up using a very sneaky\nanchor that required some specialized ghosting kit, and it still took a\nfair bit of time to get things set up. There are bolts on the last drop,\nbut they almost certainly weren't placed by canyoneers.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>Once you go down the last drop, walk a short distance downstream to\nthe North St. Vrain. From there, walk upstream. You should be able to\nfind and follow a small boot path on the south valley wall not far from\nthe river. It's not very continuous, though, so don't be afraid to climb\nover some wood and boulders closer to the river. You shouldn't need to\ncross the river, although the North St. Vrain changes a lot after floods\n(e.g., after the 2013 floods), so be wary. Work your way up the south\nbank until you come to the campsites at the intersection between the Dry\nSt. Vrain trail and the North St. Vrain River. From there, walk the Dry\nSt. Vrain trail back to your car.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n<p>Dan Scott and Ellen Daugherty did the first known descent on May 16,\n2020.</p>\n",
