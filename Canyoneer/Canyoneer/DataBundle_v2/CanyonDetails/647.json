  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>A fun canyon with a few mellow waterfall rappels and spicy downclimbs\nthroughout the upper canyon and ending with an incredible beautiful big\nwaterfall rappel.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>From Cunningham TH follow main road south east. Shortly there will be\na small road heading south, follow road. After a few hundred feet leave\nroad heading east downhill into minor drainage. Follow minor drainage a\nfew hundred feet into Grant Creek.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>Follow drainage.</p>\n<p>Bypass first major falls downclimbing LDC. Handline down everyone and\nthen partner assist last person down.</p>\n<p><strong>R1:</strong> 50' off of tree LCD crossing water flow.</p>\n<p>Not too far down stream will come to R2.</p>\n<p><strong>R2:</strong> 60' off of tree RDC into water flow.</p>\n<p><strong>R3:</strong> 30' or bypass falls downclimbing tree RDC.</p>\n<p><strong>R4:</strong> 50' or bypass falls with partner assist\ndownclimbing loose dirt/rock LCD.</p>\n<p><strong>R5:</strong> 30' down boulder directly into water flow\nanchoring off of boulder or bypass falls downclimbing loose rock\nLCD.</p>\n<p>After much bouldering and downclimbing come to the big falls.</p>\n<p>Very little options for anchoring to go down immediate water flow. At\nvery top of falls to the bottom is right at about 200', if anchoring\nback from falls come prepared with lots of webbing or do a multi-stage\nrappel LDC as described below.</p>\n<p><strong>R6:</strong> 150' off of tree above waterfall LCD to ledge\nLDC. Ledge is big enough for about 4-5 people with a couple good tree\noptions for next stage. This will get you in the flow a little.</p>\n<p><strong>R7:</strong> 80' off of tree LDC on ledge. This will not be\nin the flow at all.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>After last rappel at big falls, continue to follow Grant Creek\nthrough boulders. As soon as north side (RDC) starts to flatten out a\nlittle, leave creek to cut across to Post Creek. Boulder hop up Post\nCreek about half a mile. At first major intersection with minor creek\ncoming in on LUC, leave Post Creek going right (east). There is a faint\ntrail, but best to head up directly taking least bushy route. After a\nlittle over a mile gaining about 1800' of elevation, remainder of route\nwill flatten out. Continue north staying on ridge top for about half a\nmile. Then head right (east) downhill a short distance then uphill to\nroad. Follow road back to Cunningham TH.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><img src=\"rwl_en.png\" title=\"rwl_en.png\" alt=\"rwl_en.png\" /><a\nhref=\"http://ropewiki.com/User:Super_Amazing_Map?id=Grant_Creek_Canyon_-_Arizona\">Super\nAmazing Map</a> : Grant Creek Canyon</li>\n<li><img src=\"rwl_en.png\" title=\"rwl_en.png\" alt=\"rwl_en.png\" /><a\nhref=\"http://hikearizona.com/decoder.php?ZTN=15712\">HikeArizona.com</a>\n: Grant Creek Canyon</li>\n<li><img src=\"book.png\" title=\"book.png\" alt=\"book.png\" /><a\nhref=\"http://ropewiki.com/User:Arizona_Technical_Canyoneering_Book?id=Grant_Creek_Canyon\">Arizona\nTechnical Canyoneering Book by Todd Martin</a> : Grant Creek Canyon</li>\n<li><img src=\"rwl_en.png\" title=\"rwl_en.png\" alt=\"rwl_en.png\" /><a\nhref=\"http://toddshikingguide.com/Hikes/Arizona/Southeast/Southeast20.htm\">ToddsHikingGuide.com</a>\n: Grant Creek Trail; Pinaleno Mountains</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><img src=\"rwl_en.png\" title=\"rwl_en.png\" alt=\"rwl_en.png\" /><a\nhref=\"http://candition.com/canyons/grant-creek-canyon\">Candition.com</a>\n:</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n",
