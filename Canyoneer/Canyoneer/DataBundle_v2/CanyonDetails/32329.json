  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>A short but fun canyon in the Colorado National Monument with 4\nrappels, all with free-hangs. The poison ivy (supposedly) grows thick in\nsummer so beware. Three of the rappels land in possible PO patches. In\nwinter and early spring it is easily avoidable.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Parking:</em> 39.0327, -108.6329</li>\n<li><em>Drop In:</em> 39.03462, -108.6487</li>\n<li><em>Exit Right:</em> 39.0375, -108.6403</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>Shortly after passing through the East Entrance to the Colorado\nNational Monument, take the right run into Devils Kitchen Picnic Area\nand park here. Walk back down the Devils Kitchen Picnic Area driveway to\nthe main road and the trailhead to Serpents Trail. Hike up Serpents\nTrail up until it meets the paved road. Continue up the paved road\nanother 1/4 mile making one right turn and one left turn, taking care\nnot to walk in the drivers' blind spots. Shortly after the bend head\nright off the road and follow the bench around the head of the canyon\nand to the first rappel.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>The first rappel drops you into the canyon. There are a total of 4\nrappels, from 60 to 85 feet, all of which have free-hangs of various\nlengths. Watch your landing zone as it may contain Poison Ivy. By late\nSpring and throughout Summer the PO can be thick and completely choke\noff the canyon in places. There are several beginner-friendly\ndown-climbs.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>Shortly after the final rappel, head right up a use trail and sidle\nsoutheasterly around and back up to the parking lot.</p>\n<p>Alternate Exit (especially to reach Adder Canyon): Exit on the left\nup a somewhat spicy 5.6 climb around 39.036945, -108.641385, upstream of\nthe use trail mentioned above. Work your way up the ridge between Adder\nand this canyon. We did a couple more 5.6 climbs, but the part of the\nridge that is extremely narrow can be avoided on the south side via a\nrocky gulley. Once you reach a red cliff band, cross north through Adder\ncanyon until you reach a line of trees breaking through the red cliff\nband. Above that (near the powerline), look carefully for a thin\nhandline made of bailing wire (held fine as of 03/2018), which allows\nyou to break through the rest of the cliff band and end up just north of\nAdder, with easy access to that canyon or back to the head of this\ncanyon. There is crypto in a few spots, but watch for game trails to\neasily avoid it.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><img src=\"rwl_en.png\" title=\"rwl_en.png\" alt=\"rwl_en.png\" /><a\nhref=\"http://candition.com/canyons/ivy-canyon\">Candition.com</a> :</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n",
