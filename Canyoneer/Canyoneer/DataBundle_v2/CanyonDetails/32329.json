{"shuttleSeconds":null,"description":"<div class=\"mw-content-ltr mw-parser-output\" lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><p>A short but fun canyon in the Colorado National Monument with 4 rappels, all with free-hangs. The poison ivy (supposedly) grows thick in summer so beware. Three of the rappels land in possible PO patches. In winter and early spring it is easily avoidable.\n<\/p>\n<ul><li><i>Parking:<\/i> 39.0327, -108.6329<\/li>\n<li><i>Drop In:<\/i> 39.03462, -108.6487<\/li>\n<li><i>Exit Right:<\/i> 39.0375, -108.6403<\/li><\/ul>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Shortly after passing through the East Entrance to the Colorado National Monument, take the right run into Devils Kitchen Picnic Area and park here. Walk back down the Devils Kitchen Picnic Area driveway to the main road and the trailhead to Serpents Trail. Hike up Serpents Trail up until it meets the paved road. Continue up the paved road another 1\/4 mile making one right turn and one left turn, taking care not to walk in the drivers' blind spots. Shortly after the bend head right off the road and follow the bench around the head of the canyon and to the first rappel.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>The first rappel drops you into the canyon. There are a total of 4 rappels, from 60 to 85 feet, all of which have free-hangs of various lengths. Watch your landing zone as it may contain Poison Ivy. By late Spring and throughout Summer the PO can be thick and completely choke off the canyon in places. There are several beginner-friendly down-climbs.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Shortly after the final rappel, head right up a use trail and sidle southeasterly around and back up to the parking lot.\n<\/p><p>Alternate Exit (especially to reach Adder Canyon): Exit on the left up a somewhat spicy 5.6 climb around 39.036945, -108.641385, upstream of the use trail mentioned above. Work your way up the ridge between Adder and this canyon. We did a couple more 5.6 climbs, but the part of the ridge that is extremely narrow can be avoided on the south side via a rocky gulley. Once you reach a red cliff band, cross north through Adder canyon until you reach a line of trees breaking through the red cliff band. Above that (near the powerline), look carefully for a thin handline made of bailing wire (held fine as of 03\/2018), which allows you to break through the rest of the cliff band and end up just north of Adder, with easy access to that canyon or back to the head of this canyon. There is crypto in a few spots, but watch for game trails to easily avoid it.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Red_tape\">Red tape<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Beta_sites\">Beta sites<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media<\/h2><\/div>\n<ul><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http:\/\/candition.com\/canyons\/ivy-canyon\">Candition.com<\/a> &#160;:<\/li><\/ul>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Background\">Background<\/h2><\/div>\n\n\n<\/div>","latitude":39.0342,"waterRating":"A","id":32329,"months":["Feb","Mar","Apr"],"version":"d08a6ed65b5fc8cec8a02c99238a238b5697be302ea8e6e0e9cf70fc9c4f7f06","technicalRating":3,"url":"https:\/\/ropewiki.com\/Serpent%27s_Canyon","quality":2.9,"vehicle":"Passenger","riskRating":null,"timeRating":"II","longitude":-108.6486,"permit":"No","geojson":{"type":"FeatureCollection","features":[{"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[[-108.6334772297001,39.03282448396331,0]]},"type":"Feature","properties":{"name":"Park"}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"coordinates":[[-108.6487,39.03462,0]],"type":"Point"},"properties":{"name":"Drop in"}},{"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[[-108.6403,39.0375,0]]},"properties":{"name":"Exit right"},"type":"Feature"}]},"name":"Serpent's Canyon","rappelCountMax":4,"rappelCountMin":4,"rappelLongestMeters":25.91}
