  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>Strawberry Creek forms on the southern slope of San Jacinto Peak\nwhere water from rainfall, snowmelt, and spring discharge gathers. The\ncreek flows down Marion Mountain through the city of Idyllwild, under\nHighway 74, and eventually becomes the San Jacinto River. The area\nburned in the Cranston fire of 2018, but the canyon itself was left\nrelatively unscathed. The creek is rife with lizards and wildflowers in\nJune and July and is often sheltered by live oak and sycamore trees.\nWater runs nearly year-round, but spring to early summer conditions will\nbe cool and refreshing. Idyllwild Arts often hosts a world class jazz\nfestival in the summer and that event might be an excellent pairing for\nthe canyon.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>With a car shuttle, the canyon approach is entirely downhill. You can\nfind legal parking on Idyllmont Rd or Double View Dr. just south of the\ncreek, then descend down to it via use trails.</p>\n<p>The less steep approach is to park off the road before reaching the\nbridge and passing onto Idyllwild Arts property (whether their road is a\npublic right of way is unknown but could be investigated). If you choose\nto park before reaching the bridge, do not block the overgrown driveways\n(one driveway in particular is a rescue cache). Walk down the road until\nyou turn off, pass across the school property through the woods and down\nto the creek.</p>\n<p>The canyon can be very hot during the summer. A water filter may be\nadvisable to keep pack weight down. You will be scrambling and boulder\nhopping for many hours and miles; in truth there isn’t any “easy\nwalking” after you descend into the creek.</p>\n<p>Bring ample webbing as the majority of anchors are directly in the\nwatercourse and comprised of pinches between rocks. A climber's nut tool\nis recommended as a way to clean and access anchors safely. Rope pulls\nare generally poor. Bring lots of rope in case you stick one in the\ncanyon.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>R1</strong>: 30ft Webbing anchor around large tree,\ndownclimb to the tree from above it. (Can be bypassed canyon left)</li>\n<li><strong>R2</strong>: 40ft rabbit hole in middle of watercourse, two\nstage. (This rappel is easily bypassed canyon left but is an interesting\nrappel) (This rappel could use some bolts or an extended webbing anchor\nto make the rope pull practical) NOTE: a second stage webbing anchor on\na pinch point DCL in the water course tunnel (dark in there) was\ninstalled 14JULY2019, thus fixing the pull issues. The top anchor can be\nghosted around a large tree limb too.</li>\n<li><strong>R2X</strong>: extra rappel with many direction choices off a\nlarge tree on top of a huge boulder.</li>\n<li><strong>R3</strong>: 80ft webbing pinch DCL four stages</li>\n<li><strong>R4</strong>: 15ft webbing pinch DCL in watercourse (This\nrappel is easily bypassed canyon left)</li>\n<li><strong>R5</strong>: 35ft pinch DCR awkward start five-foot\noverhang</li>\n<li><strong>R6</strong>: 80ft pinch middle canyon, DCL of the monster\nboulder. A beautifully sculpted low angle rappel.</li>\n<li><strong>R7</strong>: 40ft pinch middle canyon next to a hanging\nsycamore</li>\n<li><strong>R8</strong>: 80ft pinch in watercourse. Staying DCR for the\nsecond stage makes for a more straightforward rappel and pull.</li>\n<li><strong>R9</strong>: 150ft pinch point in middle of\nwatercourse.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>Following the final rappel, the watercourse grows wider as it joins\nan adjacent drainage. Exit via 1.2 miles of boulder hopping down to the\nbridge. When you reach the bridge, exit the watercourse to your waiting\nvehicles. Since 2020 it would appear that the watercourse has become\nsignificantly more overgrown. It may be wise to avoid the traditional\nexit until after the next large water event due to poison oak, stinging\nnettle, and chaparral.</p>\n<p>An alternate exit without the need for a shuttle was demonstrated in\nJune 2020. Immediately after the end of the technical section, instead\nof turning south, turn northeast and scramble up a small gully to the\neast (right) of the overgrown canyon that intersects with the main\ncanyon. It's steep going at first but eases up later with hiking across\nfairly level ground until you meet the service road to the north. This\nexit took 1:40 to the road and then 0:30 of road walking to get back to\nthe Lower Parking area. Additionally this should avoid issues at lower\nelevation with Grow issue.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<p>Ideally, park at Inspiration Point and drop down into the canyon from\nthere. No access issues and you will not be crossing any private\nland.</p>\n<p>There is a large active illegal marijuana grow around the 3400ft mark\nDCL above the canyon ridge. Those tending the grow have confronted\ncanyoneers on some trips. If you stick to the canyon you will avoid the\ngrow, and the growers... hopefully</p>\n<p>Strawberry Creek is part of San Bernardino National Forest, but not\ndesignated as wilderness. Area status can be found <a\nhref=\"https://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/sbnf/recarea/?recid=74106\">here</a>.\nIf you plan to enter the creek via Idyllwild Arts, be prepared to see\nsigns telling you that creek access requires a permit. You might contact\nIdyllwild Arts for said permit; they may or may not understand what\nyou're asking for. Some parties keep a low profile and just walk on\nthrough the school during summer or on days where school is not in\nsession. If you do access the creek via the school, stick to the kml\ntrack or you'll disturb local residents on the south side of the\ncreek.</p>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<p><a\nhref=\"https://www.facebook.com/davangel/media_set?set=a.10157552805988628&amp;type=3\">David\nAngel's first descent facebook photos</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n<p>First documented descent was on July 6th, 2019 by <a\nhref=\"http://ropewiki.com/User:Dangel\">David Angel</a>, Morgan D, <a\nhref=\"http://ropewiki.com/User:Farnstrom\">Fredrik Farnstrom</a>, Cyndi\nLang, Sarah Truebe, and <a\nhref=\"http://ropewiki.com/User:Randy88fj62\">Randy Worth</a>. Due to the\npopularity of the area with locals, and proximity to climbing areas, the\npossibility exists that this canyon has previously been descended.\nHowever, no evidence of anchors or visitation was found between rappels\n3 and 9. Damaged plastic irrigation tubing - possibly from an illegal\nmarijuana grow operation - was observed in several places; this may have\nbeen transported into the canyon during a fire or storm.</p>\n<p>David Angel was first made aware of this canyon while he was\nattending <a href=\"https://www.idyllwildarts.org/summer/\">band camp</a>\nas a 13-year-old cellist. He made several trips down to the creek to\nhave lunch with friends. He descended the canyon until the downclimbs\nbecame spicy. 26 years later he scouted the canyon and decided it would\nmake an excellent first descent.</p>\n",
