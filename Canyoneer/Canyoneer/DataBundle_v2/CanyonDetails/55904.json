The creek flows down Marion Mountain through the city of Idyllwild, under Highway 74, and eventually becomes the San Jacinto River. The area burned in the Cranston fire of 2018, but the canyon itself was left relatively unscathed. The creek is rife with lizards and wildflowers in June and July and is often sheltered by live oak and sycamore trees. Water runs nearly year-round, but spring to early summer conditions will be cool and refreshing. Idyllwild Arts often hosts a world class jazz festival in the summer and that event might be an excellent pairing for the canyon.\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>With a car shuttle, the canyon approach is entirely downhill. You can find legal parking on Idyllmont Rd or Double View Dr. just south of the creek, then descend down to it via use trails.\n<\/p><p>The less steep approach is to park off the road before reaching the bridge and passing onto Idyllwild Arts property (whether their road is a public right of way is unknown but could be investigated). If you choose to park before reaching the bridge, do not block the overgrown driveways (one driveway in particular is a rescue cache). Walk down the road until you turn off, pass across the school property through the woods and down to the creek.\n<\/p><p>The canyon can be very hot during the summer. A water filter may be advisable to keep pack weight down. You will be scrambling and boulder hopping for many hours and miles; in truth there isn’t any “easy walking” after you descend into the creek.\n<\/p><p>Bring ample webbing as the majority of anchors are directly in the watercourse and comprised of pinches between rocks. A climber's nut tool is recommended as a way to clean and access anchors safely. Rope pulls are generally poor. Bring lots of rope in case you stick one in the canyon.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<ul><li><b>R1<\/b>: 30ft Webbing anchor around large tree, downclimb to the tree from above it.

Exit via 1.2 miles of boulder hopping down to the bridge. When you reach the bridge, exit the watercourse to your waiting vehicles. Since 2020 it would appear that the watercourse has become significantly more overgrown. It may be wise to avoid the traditional exit until after the next large water event due to poison oak, stinging nettle, and chaparral.\n<\/p><p>An alternate exit without the need for a shuttle was demonstrated in June 2020. Immediately after the end of the technical section, instead of turning south, turn northeast and scramble up a small gully to the east (right) of the overgrown canyon that intersects with the main canyon. It's steep going at first but eases up later with hiking across fairly level ground until you meet the service road to the north. This exit took 1:40 to the road and then 0:30 of road walking to get back to the Lower Parking area. Additionally this should avoid issues at lower elevation with Grow issue.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Red_tape\">Red tape<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Ideally, park at Inspiration Point and drop down into the canyon from there.

You might contact Idyllwild Arts for said permit; they may or may not understand what you're asking for. Some parties keep a low profile and just walk on through the school during summer or on days where school is not in session. If you do access the creek via the school, stick to the kml track or you'll disturb local residents on the south side of the creek.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Beta_sites\">Beta sites<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media<\/h2><\/div>\n<p><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/davangel\/media_set?set=a.10157552805988628&amp;type=3\">David Angel's first descent facebook photos<\/a>\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Background\">Background<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>First documented descent was on July 6th, 2019 by <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http:\/\/ropewiki.com\/User:Dangel\">David Angel<\/a>, Morgan D, <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http:\/\/ropewiki.com\/User:Farnstrom\">Fredrik Farnstrom<\/a>, Cyndi Lang, Sarah Truebe, and <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http:\/\/ropewiki.com\/User:Randy88fj62\">Randy Worth<\/a>. Due to the popularity of the area with locals, and proximity to climbing areas, the possibility exists that this canyon has previously been descended. However, no evidence of anchors or visitation was found between rappels 3 and 9. Damaged plastic irrigation tubing - possibly from an illegal marijuana grow operation - was observed in several places; this may have been transported into the canyon during a fire or storm.\n<\/p><p>David Angel was first made aware of this canyon while he was attending <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https:\/\/www.idyllwildarts.org\/summer\/\">band camp<\/a> as a 13-year-old cellist. He made several trips down to the creek to have lunch with friends. He descended the canyon until the downclimbs became spicy. 26 years later he scouted the canyon and decided it would make an excellent first descent.\n<\/p>\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nParsed by mw‐api‐ext.codfw.main‐6779cc57fc‐xd2mh\nCached time: 20240914191912\nCache expiry: 2592000\nReduced expiry: false\nComplications: []\nCPU time usage: 0.005 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.006 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 9\/1000000\nPost‐expand include size: 0\/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 0\/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 2\/100\nExpensive parser function count: 0\/500\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0\/20\nUnstrip post‐expand size: 0\/5000000 bytes\nNumber of Wikibase entities loaded: 0\/400\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%    0.000      1 -total\n-->\n<\/div>","longitude":-116.745,"version":"ae4f9fb95a035ffc9537a2ba8b4c582832cbba2fed402a5748e8e73c11262f3a","technicalRating":3,"quality":3.9,"waterRating":"B","riskRating":null,"permit":"No","shuttleSeconds":1800,"rappelCountMin":9,"name":"Strawberry Creek","timeRating":"III","rappelLongestMeters":45.72,"vehicle":"Passenger","id":55904}
