Once on top and in the right place, you should see a reasonably well defined track on top, follow along the top of the ridge before dropping into the creek at a point that suits.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Depending on how high up in the canyon you dropped in, will dictate how long it takes you to reach the giant boulder \/ chock stone that blocks the creek, you are about to start the canyon \"proper\". There was a sling here, we did not need it as it was an easy scramble down under the boulder. Once out the other side, a short abseil drops you further into the creek, then, it is about to get a lot more spectacular and interesting.\n<\/p><p>A walk along a tree root, a LONG way above the canyon floor to a tree perched on a chock stone is the first of 3 abseils to get to the bottom of this canyon. The first abseil puts you onto a section of canyon where there is another sling, we had a 50mtr rope, so it reaches to the bottom of the next abseil easily and was easy enough to pull down. This abseil is tight and dark and finishes in a deep, dark pool.\n<\/p><p>The final abseil is off a bolted anchor right at the start of the abseil, there was ZERO grip on any surface of this waterfall, so, we just slid down until we landed in a large deep pool. Looking up from this pool is just spectacular.\n<\/p><p>From here, it is just a few minutes and you are back at the Wollangambie River.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>There are two ways, downstream to one exit on the other bank of the Wollangambie or head upstream to Horseshoe Bend where you descended and crossed the Wollangambie a few hours earlier.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Red_tape\">Red tape<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Beta_sites\">Beta sites<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media<\/h2><\/div>\n<p><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https:\/\/sleepwhenwearedead.net\/2018\/02\/27\/geronimo-and-horseshoe-canyons\/\">Sleep When We Are Dead 2018 trip<\/a>\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Background\">Background<\/h2><\/div>\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nParsed by mw‐api‐ext.codfw.main‐6779cc57fc‐lrxlc\nCached time: 20240914192018\nCache expiry: 2592000\nReduced expiry: false\nComplications: [show‐toc]\nCPU time usage: 0.005 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.006 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 21\/1000000\nPost‐expand include size: 0\/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 0\/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 2\/100\nExpensive parser function count: 0\/500\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0\/20\nUnstrip post‐expand size: 0\/5000000 bytes\nNumber of Wikibase entities loaded: 0\/400\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%    0.000      1 -total\n-->\n<\/div>","version":"38ca3925d7e53684aacac4ce487d8583ca6feebc3d2aa5c1b5700e4b14ebc8c1","permit":"No","longitude":150.3547,"geojson":null,"name":"Horseshoe"}
