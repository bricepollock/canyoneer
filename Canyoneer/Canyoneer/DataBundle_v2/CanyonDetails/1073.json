If the middle rock at the top of the entry\njump is covered in water, the flow is high or higher</p>\n<h3 id=\"waterflow\">Waterflow</h3>\n<p>The USGS stream gauge on the South Fork Snoqualmie River at Garcia\n(<a\nhref=\"https://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis/inventory/?site_no=12143400\">USGS\n12143400</a>) provides a good correlation of water levels in the canyon\nupstream.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<h3 id=\"driving\">Driving</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>From Seattle (I-90 Eastbound), take Exit 52 West Summit. Turn left\n(north) to proceed under the highway and turn left (west) onto\nNF-58.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>From Ellensburg (I-90 Westbound), take Exit 53 East Summit. Turn\nleft (west) on Yellowstone Trail Rd to go under I-90. Turn right (north)\nonto WA-906 and go about 0.7 miles, continuing on NF-9041. Turn left\n(west) on NF-58.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In a quarter mile, NF-58 passes under the westbound lanes of I-90.\nVery soon, you will arrive at a gravel pullout with a low rock wall on\nthe right (north) side of the road. This is the parking area for the\nstarting point of the canyon.</p>\n<h3 id=\"shuttle\">Shuttle</h3>\n<p>Continue west on NF-58 for 1.8 miles. At the fourth switchback, there\nis room to park on the side of the road. This location is very close to\nDenny Camp Falls. Park a car here for the shuttle. Alternatively, drive\nfurther on NF-58 to the <a\nhref=\"http://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/mbs/recreation/recarea/?recid=17980&amp;actid=50\">Franklin\nFalls Trail 1036</a> trailhead parking area.</p>\n<h3 id=\"hike\">Hike</h3>\n<p>Fall in the Wall can be viewed from the low rock wall. Take a short\nsocial trail to reach the jumping point above the pool (DCL) at the base\nof Fall in the Wall.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<h3 id=\"upper_stage_to_franklin_falls\">Upper stage to Franklin\nFalls</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Jump</strong>: Start with a 10' jump into the pool below \"<a\nhref=\"http://www.waterfallsnorthwest.com/nws/falls.php?num=4564\">Fall in\nthe Wall</a>\". The jump from the DCL rock platform can be reduced by\ndown-climbing closer to the water's edge. The target is the deep pool\njust downstream from the whitewater at the bottom of the falls. The\ncurrent will carry you downstream through the short narrow section\nbetween the rock platform and the opposite wall. Avoid jumping too far\nupstream or too far out as the recirculating current can carry you\nupstream toward the falls. (<a\nhref=\"http://ropewiki.com/File:Snoqualmie_River_(South_Fork)_fall-in-water.gif\">Photo</a>).</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Continue walking/swimming downstream until an obvious narrowing in\nthe water flow. There are multiple options to reach the pool below. Use\nthe DCL rim to gain a vantage point of all the options.\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Slide</strong>: an 8' slide drops you 10' into the boil\nbelow. If the flow is medium-high or above you can be knocked into the\nDCR wall as you drop.</li>\n<li><strong>Jump</strong>: a 20' jump (more of a step-off than a jump)\nfrom the left rim drops you in the center of the deep pool below. The\nwalls of the pool are overhanging, so what seems like a narrow gap from\nthe top is actually huge at water level. (as of late summer 2020, this\npool has filled in with sediment a bit - definitely shallower than last\nyear, but still jumpable - just expect to hit bottom harder than\nusual)</li>\n<li><strong>Rappel</strong>: numerous tree anchors on either side, or\nthe overhead tree. (There's sketchy metal bars on the left rim - best to\navoid them).</li>\n<li><strong>Bypass</strong>: pick a way through the undergrowth DCL to\nrejoin the river downstream of the pool. Alternative smaller jump\nlocations possible downstream.</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Continue downstream, down-climbing, jumping, and sliding as you\nchoose. A number of the smaller pools are surprisingly deep and can be\nvery fun. There are also a few places where exit on DCL is possible via\nsocial trails.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"franklin_falls\">Franklin Falls</h3>\n<p><strong>Note: The base of Franklin Falls is a popular hiking\ndestination. The USFS has requested that canyoneers avoid descending\nFranklin Falls during peak hiking times to reduced the temptation of\nuntrained people into technical terrain</strong></p>\n<p>The main Franklin Falls has two smaller falls just above it, not\nvisible from below.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Jump</strong>: The first of the falls can be jumped\n(shallow) or scrambled around like the rest of the river up this point.\nBut be sure to climb out of the large pool DCL and head up onto the\nriver bank, looking for webbing around a conveniently positioned\ntree.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>R1</strong>: 30' from a tree DCL (<a\nhref=\"http://ropewiki.com/File:Franklin-rap1.jpg\">photo</a>), into a\nlarge pool. Swim across to get your first glimpse of the lip of the main\nfalls. Adventurous hikers can sometime be found at these pools.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The next bolts are accessed by scrambling DCL to the outside elbow of\nthe canyon. If concerned about slipping into the flow, make use of the\nsingle hand-line bolt which can be used to protect the scramble.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>R2</strong>: less of a rap, and more of a safety line for\napproaching the lip of the main fall. Use this bolt to protect access to\nthe 6' pothole, and then for the walk across to the lip of the main\nfalls. Or, just jump down into the pothole and walk to the main rap if\nflow is low.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>R3</strong>: <a\nhref=\"http://www.waterfallsnorthwest.com/nws/falls.php?num=4704\">Franklin\nFalls</a> itself: 100’ from bolts at the very lip of the falls DCL.\nExpect tourists below to watch on in amazement.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"downstream_of_franklin_falls\">Downstream of Franklin Falls</h3>\n<p>It is possible to exit the canyon from the base of Franklin Falls by\nfollowing the main trail (the one with nicely built steps) down to\nwherever you parked. The section below Franklin Falls drops 60’ over 1/2\nmile; it has two bolted rappels, 15’ and 40’, and two notable jumps, 8’\nand 15’. Be extremely cautious as most of the pools in the lower section\nhave boulders or underwater ledges and are hazardous for jumping. There\nis a well maintained hiker trail all along the route DCL.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>R4</strong>: 15’ from single bolt DCL</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>R5</strong> (<a\nhref=\"http://www.waterfallsnorthwest.com/nws/falls.php?num=4567\">Denny\nCamp Falls</a>): 30' from bolts DCL</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>The last rappel of the route, Denny Camp Falls, is a waterfall that\nshoots out creating an arch. Immediately after this rappel is a large\npool, a use trail DCL from the bottom of the pool takes up to the actual\nofficial trail which then takes to the parking lot. Don't forget the\nlast jump of the canyon just below this trail - it's a fun way to wash\nup before the hike out.</p>\n<p>If you didn't shuttle, you can walk the wagon road trail that\nparallels the road, then only have to walk the road a short ways back to\nFall into the Wall.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<p>Any one of the following passes is required to park at the\ntrailhead:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a\nhref=\"http://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/r6/passes-permits/recreation/?cid=fsbdev2_027009\">National\nForest Day Pass</a></li>\n<li><a\nhref=\"http://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/r6/passes-permits/recreation/?cid=fsbdev2_027010\">Northwest\nForest Pass</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://store.usgs.gov/pass/index.html\">National Parks and\nFederal Recreational Lands Pass</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><img src=\"rwl_en.png\" title=\"rwl_en.png\" alt=\"rwl_en.png\" /><a\nhref=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20210527212206/www.canyoneeringnorthwest.com/SouthForkSnolqualmieRiver/South_Fork_Snolqualmie_River.php\">CanyoneeringNorthwest.com\n(archive.org)</a> : South Fork Snoqualmie River</li>\n<li><img src=\"rwl_en.png\" title=\"rwl_en.png\" alt=\"rwl_en.png\" /><a\nhref=\"http://ropewiki.com/User:Super_Amazing_Map?id=Snolqualmie_River_(South_Fork)_-_Washington\">Super\nAmazing Map</a> : Snolqualmie River (South Fork)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n",
