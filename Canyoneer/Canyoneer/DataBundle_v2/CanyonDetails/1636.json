As the creek descends it produces a set of amazing waterfalls, the most famous being Havasu Falls.\nThis non-technical backpacking adventure will take you onto Indian land, down to the Indian village of Supai and beyond.\nMany hikers just hike the trail and enjoy the waters without knowing that there are many adventures to be had in this ancient land... if you know its secrets.\nThe information detailed in this beta will help you plan your visit and make you aware of some of the amazing spots that this area has to offer.\n<\/p><p><b>DISCLAIMER: Before entering a mine, cave or jumping off a cliff, remember to use your own judgement! Your safety is your own responsibility.

You can camp at the Havasupai campground (near the Havasu Falls) or you can stay at the lodge (in the Supai Village). Either way you will need reservations, preferably reserving 6 months in advance. You may need perseverance calling the Indian Reservation and sometimes the phones don't work at all. \n<\/p><p>The best season to go is September\/October followed by May\/June. During these months the weather is not too hot and the days are still long. June is packed with visitors, as most young backbackers are out of college. September is less crowded and easier to find nice campsites. July and August is monsoon season, it may rain a lot or camp may be closed or evacuated due to flash flood danger. In April and November days may be too short or it may be too cold to endure long exposure to the nice cool waters, which flow at constant temperature of 70F all year around. \n<\/p><p>Plan your trip carefully, as there are limited facilities down at the Village of Supai. If you stay at the lodge you can go with just a day pack and have dinner there. If you stay at the campground you will need full backpacking gear and to carry food for several days. With advanced reservation you can arrange for mules to carry some of your stuff down (or back up) and then backpack with light loads. The hike down to Supai Village is 8 miles downhill (10 miles if going to the campground).\n<\/p><p>One can also take a Helicopter in or out from Supai Village. It costs $85 each way and it flies only on specific days of the week (best to call them to confirm). It is usually not worth it for the way in, but is a fantastic option for the way out as it saves 6 hours of uphill hiking and you'll be well rested for the drive home.\n<\/p><p>For more information and reservations go to <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external free\" href=\"http:\/\/havasupaifalls.net\">http:\/\/havasupaifalls.net<\/a>\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading3\"><h3 id=\"How_To_Get_There\">How To Get There<\/h3><\/div>\n<ul><li>From Kingman to the Hualapai Hilltop is a 2-3 hour drive (130 miles)<\/li>\n<li>From Peach Springs to the Hilltop is a 1-1.5h hour drive (70 miles)<\/li><\/ul>\n<p>It is recommended to drive out the evening before the hike down, spend the night in a motel or camp near the trailhead, and then start the hike the next day at dawn.

You can stop by on the way in or on the way back. In order to fully enjoy Havasu Canyon you will need at least 3 days, preferably more. A shorter itinerary might look like this:\n<\/p>\n<ul><li>First Day: Hike Down - Start at dawn, briefly stop at Havasu Spring, then bolt for camp to secure a nice site. After that go for a swim in Havasu Falls, explore the Crystal Mine. If you have time check out some of the other mines around camp or hike the Mesa Trail.<\/li>\n<li>Second Day: Waterfalls - Hike to Beaver Falls but take time to explore the interesting spots along the way. Go for a swim in Mooney Falls, stick to the wet route down to Beaver and try to find the Green and Blue rooms. If you are a small group you may have time to attempt the climb up the Vanadium mine or the hike down to the Colorado River still in daylight. But if you can afford it, it is better to allocate an extra day exclusively for the Colorado River hike.<\/li>\n<li>Third Day: Fly Back - Take it easy, pack camp and head for Supai Village. If you have time, stop to play at Havasu Falls, Rock Falls and New Navajo Falls along the way. Make sure you get to Supai by noon to catch the helicopter out. Reservations are not needed, but last flight is usually 1pm.<\/li><\/ul>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading3\"><h3 id=\"Havasu_Springs\">Havasu Springs<\/h3><\/div>\n<ul><li>The source of Havasu Creek is very unique. To get to it you walk upstream about 1\/4 mile from where Hualapai Canyon meets Cataract Creek. The easiest way to get there is to make a small detour on your hike in. When you first see Havasu Creek hike upstream for about 1\/4 mile rather than following the signs pointing downstream. Small springs cover this area and together they make the large Havasu Creek.<\/li>\n<li>Around the spring area there is an ancient Indian cliff dwelling, look on the walls on canyon right (right looking downstream). It's not very obvious, but if you look for it you may find it.<\/li>\n<li>Watch for signs restricting access; this area may be inaccessible<\/li><\/ul>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading3\"><h3 id=\"Supai_Village\">Supai Village<\/h3><\/div>\n<ul><li>You can refill bottles at a faucet on the east side of the Tourist Office building (right before helipad).<\/li>\n<li>Many opt to send postcards stamped with mules from Post Office (unique in the USA).<\/li>\n<li>Small Museum next to tourist office, you can ask at the office to give you access<\/li>\n<li>Be sure to check out the two smaller waterfalls above Havasu Falls proper (Rock Falls and New Navajo Falls), either on the way in or on the way out.<\/li>\n<li>The helicopter out of Supai only runs 2-4 days a week, make sure you plan accordingly. In my opinion this is the best return option. It costs $85 but allows you to spend an extra 1\/2 day and save 6h of hiking time and have a killer helicopter experience too. If too expensive, the next best thing is to hire a mule to lighten your load so you can hike with a day pack.

You can jump 30ft from the top of these falls in the pool below.<\/li>\n<li>There's a hidden rope you can grab to get to the very edge and then jump. I'm holding the rope in the picture.<\/li>\n<li>You can also just skip the rope and take a run and jump. (just make sure you jump in the right spot).<\/li>\n<li>Summer flash floods change the canyon every year, make sure the falls are still safe to jump when you go<\/li><\/ul>\n<ul><li>Once you're done jumping don't forget to sneak into the back of the waterfall<\/li><\/ul>\n<p><br \/>\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading3\"><h3 id=\"New_Navajo_Falls\">New Navajo Falls<\/h3><\/div>\n<ul><li>New Navajo Falls is a beautiful little Travertine grotto, very scenic.<\/li><\/ul>\n<p><br \/>\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading3\"><h3 id=\"Havasu_Falls\">Havasu Falls<\/h3><\/div>\n<ul><li>Some say it's forbidden to rappel the falls, but some people have done it and posted pictures online.

You can get on top of the cliff by climbing up Ghost Canyon which is just beyond the cemetery as you are walking into the canyon and near the top of Havasu Falls.<\/li>\n<li>Short distance before the falls the trail branches off to the right to go to Carbonate Mesa Trail. This is a flat hike through nice sky terraces with sweeping views of Havasu Falls, camp and below. THIS IS NOT FOR A MIDDAY HIKE. 30-45min round trip, only do it if want to kill some time some afternoon and it's too cold to go play in the water.<\/li>\n<li>You can get behind Havasu Falls at the bottom pool, climb the rocks to a grotto 15ft up and jump off into the waterfall, having the falls push you under the water, then out toward the pools.<\/li><\/ul>\n<p><br \/>\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading3\"><h3 id=\"Campground\">Campground<\/h3><\/div>\n<ul><li>Lower end of campground has nicer sites.

Lead was mined here for the last time during WWII. Ranger Gale Burack, who worked at Grand Canyon, wrote of her experiences in the miners camp where the campground now resides (Arizona Highways, September, 1984).<\/li>\n<li>To get to the mine cross the rim of the Havasu Falls pool and get into Carbonate canyon, head 1\/4 miles up canyon and on the right you'll find a big opening with a pipe sticking out, this is the entrance of the mine.<\/li><\/ul>\n<ul><li>This a cool 3 level mine. Not trivial to navigate, but not too complicated to explore. Inside the mine there's a big shaft that crosses the 3 levels, but the bottom can be reached by an alternate route climbing down static ropes.<\/li>\n<li>Watch for a hole at ground level near some wood false floor (see picture), there will be a rope hanging here. Follow the rope down to reach 2nd level of the mine. It's a awkward climb, but not too hard to get out. Check that all of you will be able to climb back up BEFORE you climb down. If you can't, stay out.<\/li><\/ul>\n<ul><li>Bring a 30ft webbing or rope to descend from 2nd to 3rd level, since a rope is not always there. This climb is only for experienced adventurers because if you fall down you will be trapped in a water shaft full of rotten logs. If you happen to fall in and your buddies do not rescue quickly you may die of exhaustion or hypothermia or both. Double wrap webbing or rope around your hands and wear gloves for maximum friction. The climb is not that hard, but it is not for everyone either.

This is a great place to stop for a few pics and to cool off.<\/li>\n<li>About 1\/4 of a mile down, there is a small stream which feeds into the creek, over the side of the cliff, effectively creating a place to shower.

Enter that current and just before you would be hit with the fall dive under water. You should see a small cave under the water. It is not very large and will be very dark. Swimming into it is like a leap of faith. I can hold my breath for two minutes but was still very unnerved. Once inside the cave feel your way deeper for about ten feet or so. You will emerge without warning into a small air pocket. There is a small shelf you can stand on and there is only enough room for two people. Looking back the tunnel is a green color that lights up the cave.'<\/li>\n<li>'I found the \"Green Room.\" It was eight feet down and eight feet back approximately and not all that easy to find having no more than a pair of goggles to aid me in my search. It was much smaller than I would have thought, but enough area to get your head up and breath for a little bit. Since I went in the morning, it was also very dark and not green at all. Just search underneath a big underwater overhang under the large falls of Beaver.'<\/li>\n<li>'I learn that you can swim behind Beaver Falls, descend about 7', go through a large hole for about 8' then ascend the 7' to a small cavern. (Careful - there's a stalactite that ends not too far above surface level - be very careful ascending!) It's called the Green Room, because of the color of the light that passes through the water and is apparently quite beautiful with ferns surrounding you.

We drank from Gatorade and Vitamin Water bottles.\n<\/p><p><br \/>\n<\/p><p><b>Special note for Colorado River rafters:<\/b> In 2018, during a 21-day rafting trip, we hiked up Havasu canyon after docking our boats at the confluence. We were stopped at Beaver Falls by a Havasupai guard with a walkie-talkie. He said that a daily entrance pass onto reservation land was $55pp, cash only. He would not take a credit card (we believed it would have been technically possible for him to call a cc number over his radio to charge from their office, but he would not try it). Although we had enough money back at the boats, there was no sign in the lower canyon advising us of the fee, and thus we did not know of it when we started the 3 mile hike up, so of course we did not have money on us. He turned all of our group back around the corner, out of sight of lower Beaver Falls. Keep this in mind if you are rafting and would like to visit the beautiful Havasupai land -- plan ahead either bringing cash or possibly arranging admission from the tribe in advance of your rafting trip (although timing the exact date of arrival during your rafting trip might be tricky).\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Beta_sites\">Beta sites<\/h2><\/div>\n<ul><li><a
