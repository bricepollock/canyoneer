As the creek\ndescends it produces a set of amazing waterfalls, the most famous being\nHavasu Falls. This non-technical backpacking adventure will take you\nonto Indian land, down to the Indian village of Supai and beyond. Many\nhikers just hike the trail and enjoy the waters without knowing that\nthere are many adventures to be had in this ancient land... if you know\nits secrets. The information detailed in this beta will help you plan\nyour visit and make you aware of some of the amazing spots that this\narea has to offer.</p>\n<p><strong>DISCLAIMER: Before entering a mine, cave or jumping off a\ncliff, remember to use your own judgement! Your safety is your own\nresponsibility. If something feels too dangerous or unsafe, don't do\nit!</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Special notes for Colorado River rafters in Red Tape section\nbelow</strong></p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>Havasu Canyon is best visited over a long weekend, spending a minimum\nof 3 days and 2 nights down in the canyon. You can camp at the Havasupai\ncampground (near the Havasu Falls) or you can stay at the lodge (in the\nSupai Village). Either way you will need reservations, preferably\nreserving 6 months in advance. You may need perseverance calling the\nIndian Reservation and sometimes the phones don't work at all.</p>\n<p>The best season to go is September/October followed by May/June.\nDuring these months the weather is not too hot and the days are still\nlong. June is packed with visitors, as most young backbackers are out of\ncollege. September is less crowded and easier to find nice campsites.\nJuly and August is monsoon season, it may rain a lot or camp may be\nclosed or evacuated due to flash flood danger. In April and November\ndays may be too short or it may be too cold to endure long exposure to\nthe nice cool waters, which flow at constant temperature of 70F all year\naround.</p>\n<p>Plan your trip carefully, as there are limited facilities down at the\nVillage of Supai. If you stay at the lodge you can go with just a day\npack and have dinner there. If you stay at the campground you will need\nfull backpacking gear and to carry food for several days. With advanced\nreservation you can arrange for mules to carry some of your stuff down\n(or back up) and then backpack with light loads. The hike down to Supai\nVillage is 8 miles downhill (10 miles if going to the campground).</p>\n<p>One can also take a Helicopter in or out from Supai Village. It costs\n$85 each way and it flies only on specific days of the week (best to\ncall them to confirm). It is usually not worth it for the way in, but is\na fantastic option for the way out as it saves 6 hours of uphill hiking\nand you'll be well rested for the drive home.</p>\n<p>For more information and reservations go to <a\nhref=\"http://havasupaifalls.net\">http://havasupaifalls.net</a></p>\n<h3 id=\"how_to_get_there\">How To Get There</h3>\n<figure>\n<img src=\"Hilltop.jpg\" title=\"Hilltop.jpg\" />\n<figcaption>Hilltop.jpg</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<ul>\n<li>From Kingman to the Hualapai Hilltop is a 2-3 hour drive (130\nmiles)</li>\n<li>From Peach Springs to the Hilltop is a 1-1.5h hour drive (70\nmiles)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It is recommended to drive out the evening before the hike down,\nspend the night in a motel or camp near the trailhead, and then start\nthe hike the next day at dawn. The first half of the hike is in full\nsunlight and starting early will avoid the heat. It will also allow you\nto get to camp earlier than other visitors and claim a better camping\nspot for your group. The lower end of campground has nicer sites. East\nside (crossing creek) is usually quieter and fills up later. The south\nside of the campground is the last to fill up.</p>\n<h3 id=\"motels\">Motels</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Grand Canyon Caverns: 5 miles east of turnoff 18, decent, closer to\nhilltop, with restaurant.

You can stop by on the way in or on the way back. In order to\nfully enjoy Havasu Canyon you will need at least 3 days, preferably\nmore. A shorter itinerary might look like this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>First Day: Hike Down - Start at dawn, briefly stop at Havasu Spring,\nthen bolt for camp to secure a nice site. After that go for a swim in\nHavasu Falls, explore the Crystal Mine. If you have time check out some\nof the other mines around camp or hike the Mesa Trail.</li>\n<li>Second Day: Waterfalls - Hike to Beaver Falls but take time to\nexplore the interesting spots along the way. Go for a swim in Mooney\nFalls, stick to the wet route down to Beaver and try to find the Green\nand Blue rooms. If you are a small group you may have time to attempt\nthe climb up the Vanadium mine or the hike down to the Colorado River\nstill in daylight. But if you can afford it, it is better to allocate an\nextra day exclusively for the Colorado River hike.</li>\n<li>Third Day: Fly Back - Take it easy, pack camp and head for Supai\nVillage. If you have time, stop to play at Havasu Falls, Rock Falls and\nNew Navajo Falls along the way. Make sure you get to Supai by noon to\ncatch the helicopter out. Reservations are not needed, but last flight\nis usually 1pm.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"havasu_springs\">Havasu Springs</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The source of Havasu Creek is very unique. To get to it you walk\nupstream about 1/4 mile from where Hualapai Canyon meets Cataract Creek.\nThe easiest way to get there is to make a small detour on your hike in.\nWhen you first see Havasu Creek hike upstream for about 1/4 mile rather\nthan following the signs pointing downstream. Small springs cover this\narea and together they make the large Havasu Creek.</li>\n<li>Around the spring area there is an ancient Indian cliff dwelling,\nlook on the walls on canyon right (right looking downstream). It's not\nvery obvious, but if you look for it you may find it.</li>\n<li>Watch for signs restricting access; this area may be\ninaccessible</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"supai_village\">Supai Village</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>You can refill bottles at a faucet on the east side of the Tourist\nOffice building (right before helipad).</li>\n<li>Many opt to send postcards stamped with mules from Post Office\n(unique in the USA).</li>\n<li>Small Museum next to tourist office, you can ask at the office to\ngive you access</li>\n<li>Be sure to check out the two smaller waterfalls above Havasu Falls\nproper (Rock Falls and New Navajo Falls), either on the way in or on the\nway out.</li>\n<li>The helicopter out of Supai only runs 2-4 days a week, make sure you\nplan accordingly. In my opinion this is the best return option. It costs\n$85 but allows you to spend an extra 1/2 day and save 6h of hiking time\nand have a killer helicopter experience too. If too expensive, the next\nbest thing is to hire a mule to lighten your load so you can hike with a\nday pack. More info www.havasupaitribe.com</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"rock_falls\">Rock Falls</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Rock Falls is the Indian's favorite swimming hole. You can jump 30ft\nfrom the top of these falls in the pool below.</li>\n<li>There's a hidden rope you can grab to get to the very edge and then\njump. I'm holding the rope in the picture.</li>\n<li>You can also just skip the rope and take a run and jump. (just make\nsure you jump in the right spot).</li>\n<li>Summer flash floods change the canyon every year, make sure the\nfalls are still safe to jump when you go</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"Jump.png\" title=\"Jump.png\" alt=\"Jump.png\" /> <img\nsrc=\"Jump2.png\" title=\"Jump2.png\" alt=\"Jump2.png\" /></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Once you're done jumping don't forget to sneak into the back of the\nwaterfall</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"Back.png\" title=\"Back.png\" alt=\"Back.png\" /> <img\nsrc=\"Back2.png\" title=\"Back2.png\" alt=\"Back2.png\" /></p>\n<h3 id=\"new_navajo_falls\">New Navajo Falls</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>New Navajo Falls is a beautiful little Travertine grotto, very\nscenic.</li>\n</ul>\n<figure>\n<img src=\"Navajo.png\" title=\"Navajo.png\" />\n<figcaption>Navajo.png</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<h3 id=\"havasu_falls\">Havasu Falls</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Some say it's forbidden to rappel the falls, but some people have\ndone it and posted pictures online. The water is so strong that you have\nto rappel dry, out of the water. If you do so, be discreet and to avoid\nany confrontation with the Indians.</li>\n<li>Hike on top of the cliffs above the campground and beyond. You can\nget on top of the cliff by climbing up Ghost Canyon which is just beyond\nthe cemetery as you are walking into the canyon and near the top of\nHavasu Falls.</li>\n<li>Short distance before the falls the trail branches off to the right\nto go to Carbonate Mesa Trail. This is a flat hike through nice sky\nterraces with sweeping views of Havasu Falls, camp and below. THIS IS\nNOT FOR A MIDDAY HIKE. 30-45min round trip, only do it if want to kill\nsome time some afternoon and it's too cold to go play in the water.</li>\n<li>You can get behind Havasu Falls at the bottom pool, climb the rocks\nto a grotto 15ft up and jump off into the waterfall, having the falls\npush you under the water, then out toward the pools.</li>\n</ul>\n<figure>\n<img src=\"hfalls.jpg\" title=\"hfalls.jpg\" width=\"250\" />\n<figcaption>hfalls.jpg</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<h3 id=\"campground\">Campground</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Lower end of campground has nicer sites. East side (crossing creek)\nis usually quieter and last to flll up. Fern Spring at north end of camp\nis reliable (no treatment). South side of campground is the last to fill\nup.</li>\n<li>If you can't find a site with a table available, ask some other\ngroup if you can share one</li>\n<li>Hang food and trash from trees. Squirrels will chew through tents\nand packs to steal food.</li>\n<li>There are a few abandoned mines that you can explore right around\ncamp. (see notes below)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"crystal_mine\">Crystal Mine</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>This is the largest of the mines in Carbonate Canyon, adjacent to\nHavasu Falls, where rails and timbers still can be found descending\nthree levels. Lead was mined here for the last time during WWII. Ranger\nGale Burack, who worked at Grand Canyon, wrote of her experiences in the\nminers camp where the campground now resides (Arizona Highways,\nSeptember, 1984).</li>\n<li>To get to the mine cross the rim of the Havasu Falls pool and get\ninto Carbonate canyon, head 1/4 miles up canyon and on the right you'll\nfind a big opening with a pipe sticking out, this is the entrance of the\nmine.</li>\n</ul>\n<figure>\n<img src=\"crystal.png\" title=\"crystal.png\" />\n<figcaption>crystal.png</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<ul>\n<li>This a cool 3 level mine. Not trivial to navigate, but not too\ncomplicated to explore. Inside the mine there's a big shaft that crosses\nthe 3 levels, but the bottom can be reached by an alternate route\nclimbing down static ropes.</li>\n<li>Watch for a hole at ground level near some wood false floor (see\npicture), there will be a rope hanging here. Follow the rope down to\nreach 2nd level of the mine. It's a awkward climb, but not too hard to\nget out. Check that all of you will be able to climb back up BEFORE you\nclimb down. If you can't, stay out.</li>\n</ul>\n<figure>\n<img src=\"crysta2.png\" title=\"crysta2.png\" />\n<figcaption>crysta2.png</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<ul>\n<li>Bring a 30ft webbing or rope to descend from 2nd to 3rd level, since\na rope is not always there. This climb is only for experienced\nadventurers because if you fall down you will be trapped in a water\nshaft full of rotten logs. If you happen to fall in and your buddies do\nnot rescue quickly you may die of exhaustion or hypothermia or both.\nDouble wrap webbing or rope around your hands and wear gloves for\nmaximum friction. The climb is not that hard, but it is not for everyone\neither. Use your own judgment.</li>\n</ul>\n<figure>\n<img src=\"crystal3.png\" title=\"crystal3.png\" />\n<figcaption>crystal3.png</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<h3 id=\"another_mine\">Another Mine</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Next to center of campground and visible from main trail on canyon\nleft .</li>\n<li>Exposed climb required to access the 2 entrances, not very long,\njust one level, but cool.</li>\n</ul>\n<figure>\n<img src=\"moremines.png\" title=\"moremines.png\" />\n<figcaption>moremines.png</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<h3 id=\"mooney_falls\">Mooney Falls</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Some say it's forbidden to rappel the falls, but some people have\ndone it and posted pictures online. The water is so strong that you have\nto rappel dry, out of the water. If you do so, be discreet and avoid any\nconfrontation with the Indians.</li>\n<li>It is possible to swim to the left of the falls to the rock wall,\nand then shimmy your way across the rock (while staying in the water) to\na small cave that is located just above the water line, approximately\n15–20 feet (5 to 6 meters) away from the falls (only attempt if you are\na strong swimmer).</li>\n<li>There is an island located in the middle, which breaks the pool into\ntwo streams. Standing on this island allows for very dramatic pictures,\nas it looks you are engulfed by the waterfall.</li>\n</ul>\n<figure>\n<img src=\"mooney.jpg\" title=\"mooney.jpg\" width=\"250\" />\n<figcaption>mooney.jpg</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<h3 id=\"ghost_canyon\">Ghost Canyon</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>deep and narrow burial canyon with a warm spring and 300ft walls\njust below Mooney. Great place to escape midday summer sun. Where Ghost\ncanyon intersects Havasu creek it creates a grotto (set of pretty\nwaterfalls) on the west side of the Havasu creek.</li>\n<li>About 300 yards down from the Mooney Falls pool is a very cool cave\non the left filled with ferns and water pouring down over the top. This\nis a great place to stop for a few pics and to cool off.</li>\n<li>About 1/4 of a mile down, there is a small stream which feeds into\nthe creek, over the side of the cliff, effectively creating a place to\nshower. Follow the trail off to the right towards the creek, then back\ntowards Mooney Falls a bit and you'll find this mini-waterfall.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"cataract_mine_vanadium_mine\">Cataract Mine / Vanadium Mine</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>On canyon left down from Mooney Falls, immediately after Ghost\nCanyon</li>\n<li>This mine requires a 256ft climb of a metal ladder to main entrance.\nThe pipe ladder ascends to a vanadium deposit several hundred feet above\nthe canyon floor.</li>\n<li>Near the top, barely visible in this image, are the words \"Enter the\nDragon,\" presumably painted by a local tribe member.</li>\n<li>Historical reports says it's only 30ft deep tunnel and that the\nbottom part of ladder is missing since indian boys were injured climbing\nup to the mine.</li>\n<li>Climbing equipment recommended to attempt the ascent, will need to\nclimb first section of ladder that is missing, see pictures below to get\nan idea</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"vanadium.png\" title=\"vanadium.png\" alt=\"vanadium.png\" />\n<img src=\"vanadium2.png\" title=\"vanadium2.png\" alt=\"vanadium2.png\" />\n<img src=\"vanadium3.png\" title=\"vanadium3.png\"\nalt=\"vanadium3.png\" /></p>\n<h3 id=\"buddha_cave\">Buddha Cave</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>A short distance below Mooney, where the canyon is starting to\nnarrow, the trail will go by a cave with a Buddha painting in it.</li>\n<li>You'll have to climb 6ft to get there, but it is easy. The cave\nprovides shade and peace to visitors.</li>\n</ul>\n<figure>\n<img src=\"buddha.png\" title=\"buddha.png\" />\n<figcaption>buddha.png</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<h3 id=\"jacuzzi_spring\">Jacuzzi Spring</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>A short distance down the canyons there is a spring that bubbles up\ncreating a sort of natural jacuzzi in the middle of the river. You can\nrecognize the location because it's immediately above a 10ft waterfall\n(see picture below).</li>\n<li>In the middle of the big pool at the top there is a massive water\njet that push upward, very fun to \"body surf\" it!</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"jacuzzi.png\" title=\"jacuzzi.png\" alt=\"jacuzzi.png\" /> <img\nsrc=\"jacuzzi2.png\" title=\"jacuzzi2.png\" alt=\"jacuzzi2.png\" /></p>\n<h3 id=\"rope_swing\">Rope Swing</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>A short distance down from the Jacuzzi Spring there used to be a\nrope swing that was really fun, but in 2012 I could not find it\nanymore.</li>\n<li>I was told the pool got too shallow after some flash flood, so it's\nno more. Still fun to look for it.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"swing.png\" title=\"swing.png\" alt=\"swing.png\" /> <img\nsrc=\"swing2.png\" title=\"swing2.png\" alt=\"swing2.png\" /></p>\n<h3 id=\"beaver_falls\">Beaver Falls</h3>\n<p>These pools are small, but still offer good swimming. Like the\nprevious three falls, there are many places to cliff-jump and there are\nmany good sites to explore. My suggestion is to visit the falls\nfollowing the Wet route IN and the Dry route OUT. There are two\nunderwater caves that are called the Green Room and the Blue Room.</p>\n<h4 id=\"wet_route\">Wet Route</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>If the group has an adventurous spirit take the “wet route” to\nBeaver Falls; if you choose this option there will be the opportunity to\nswim to the “Blue Room” -- an under water air pocket accessed by\nswimming beneath the first tier of the waterfall! Once you emerge from\nthe green room, the thrill of discovering this canyon secret will help\nyou steel your courage to JUMP off the main fall (18’) into the frothy\npool below (have someone check depth first!)</li>\n<li>Once at the base at the falls you can engage in the hunt for the\nfabled Green Room, another underwater cave that is harder to get than\nthe Blue Room.</li>\n<li>About 50 yards down from Beaver there is a cliff about 60 feet high\nthat you can jump off of, you'll recognize it by the deep blue pool. If\nyou jump it, there’s not an easy way to get back up…but it can be\ndone.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 id=\"dry_route\">Dry Route</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>The trail will lead to a point where there appears to be no way to\ngo, except for getting wet. But to the right, on the rock ledge, there\nis a rope hanging down (always test ropes you did not place before\nclimbing them). Climb up this rope. It is a difficult climb of around 8\nfeet (2.4 m).</li>\n<li>In 2012 rope was replaced with a wood ladder that makes the climb\nvery easy, both up and down</li>\n<li>Follow the trail up and follow it downstream. There is a rock\nchute/slide located to your left; this is the difficult access to the\nfalls. There is an easier access point if you hike to the point just\nbefore the trail turns north to continue down the canyon. Look for ducks\nhere. River rafters have beaten a path to the 60ft ledge where they\njump. Go on upstream, gradually working your way to the creek bed. Climb\ndown to the creek and the falls are just upstream.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 id=\"blue_room_top_tier_beaver_falls_dive_3ft_down_and_6ft_in\">Blue\nRoom (Top Tier Beaver Falls, dive 3ft down and 6ft in)</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Go to the top tier of the Beaver falls, start in from the left side\nand slip underwater and into a small cave.</li>\n<li>It is not very hard to get to as it is only a few feet behind the\nwall. Dive 3ft down and 6ft in into a small cave.</li>\n<li>You can feel the cave with your feet from the outside. Watch your\nhead going in. From the inside, you can stick one foot out and help\nother people get in by letting them grab your leg and pulling them in.\nWatch their head.</li>\n<li>Red arrow below marks the location of the underwater entrance\n(notice the difference that a sunny vs cloudy day makes on water\ncolors).</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"Havasu_Beaver_Blue_Room_1.png\"\ntitle=\"Havasu_Beaver_Blue_Room_1.png\"\nalt=\"Havasu_Beaver_Blue_Room_1.png\" /> <img\nsrc=\"Havasu_Beaver_Blue_Room_2.png\"\ntitle=\"Havasu_Beaver_Blue_Room_2.png\"\nalt=\"Havasu_Beaver_Blue_Room_2.png\" /></p>\n<ul>\n<li>No need for flashlight/headlamp inside this cave</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"Havasu_Beaver_Blue_Room_3.png\"\ntitle=\"Havasu_Beaver_Blue_Room_3.png\"\nalt=\"Havasu_Beaver_Blue_Room_3.png\" /> <img\nsrc=\"Havasu_Beaver_Blue_Room_4.png\"\ntitle=\"Havasu_Beaver_Blue_Room_4.png\"\nalt=\"Havasu_Beaver_Blue_Room_4.png\" /></p>\n<h4\nid=\"green_room_bottom_tier_beaver_falls_dive_9ft_down_and_10ft_in\">Green\nRoom (Bottom Tier Beaver Falls, dive 9ft down and 10ft in)</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Accessing the Green Room is not for everyone. It requires strong\nswimming skills and the aid of diving goggles/mask.</li>\n<li>We could not access the Green Room because pool was filled in from\nlast flash flood (August 2012). Below are quotes from people that claims\nvisited the fabled Green Room:</li>\n<li>'If you go to the beach at the base of beaver falls you will see an\neddy current that brings you close to the fall. Enter that current and\njust before you would be hit with the fall dive under water. You should\nsee a small cave under the water. It is not very large and will be very\ndark. Swimming into it is like a leap of faith. I can hold my breath for\ntwo minutes but was still very unnerved. Once inside the cave feel your\nway deeper for about ten feet or so. You will emerge without warning\ninto a small air pocket. There is a small shelf you can stand on and\nthere is only enough room for two people. Looking back the tunnel is a\ngreen color that lights up the cave.'</li>\n<li>'I found the \"Green Room.\" It was eight feet down and eight feet\nback approximately and not all that easy to find having no more than a\npair of goggles to aid me in my search. It was much smaller than I would\nhave thought, but enough area to get your head up and breath for a\nlittle bit. Since I went in the morning, it was also very dark and not\ngreen at all. Just search underneath a big underwater overhang under the\nlarge falls of Beaver.'</li>\n<li>'I learn that you can swim behind Beaver Falls, descend about 7', go\nthrough a large hole for about 8' then ascend the 7' to a small cavern.\n(Careful - there's a stalactite that ends not too far above surface\nlevel - be very careful ascending!) It's called the Green Room, because\nof the color of the light that passes through the water and is\napparently quite beautiful with ferns surrounding you. Tom Cruise was\nthere a few years ago.'</li>\n</ul>\n<h4\nid=\"false_green_room_bottom_tier_beaver_falls_marginal_diving_involved\">False\nGreen Room (Bottom Tier Beaver Falls, marginal diving involved)</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>There is another “Green Room” in the bottom falls . This Green Room\nisn’t a submerged room but it is a pocket behind a waterfall. Its fun to\ntry to get into it. Enter it from the side and slip into the small\nopening grabbing on the rocks to push yourself inside. Once inside there\nwere no strong currents, but there were some outside of the cave.</li>\n<li>To come out you can just dive down and let the waterfall flush you\nout, but <strong>watch out for hydraulics</strong>!</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"falsegreen.png\" title=\"falsegreen.png\"\nalt=\"falsegreen.png\" /> <img src=\"falsegreen2.png\"\ntitle=\"falsegreen2.png\" alt=\"falsegreen2.png\" /></p>\n<h3 id=\"past_beaver_falls\">Past Beaver Falls</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>From Beaver Falls you can hike up and down Beaver canyon (1h\nstrenuous climb up boulder strewn canyon, not sure it's worth it)</li>\n<li>From Beaver Falls you can hike 3 miles down to the confluence with\nthe Colorado River (add 3h-5h more hours for the round trip). There are\nmultiple ways to reach the Colorado, yet the best is to go back up the\nchute to the trail and follow that downstream. This spot is also popular\nfor river rafters to stop and to head up the canyon.</li>\n<li>Stick to the trail (not the creek), follow the cairns and you'll do\nonly 5 creek crossings.</li>\n<li>Colorado river is 7h-10h round trip from campground. If you want to\ndo it be ready to leave predawn and come back in the dark, and do not\nexpect to have much time to play in the waterfalls.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>Options for the return:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Leave camp at 4-5am for a grueling 10 mile hike uphill. (8 miles if\nleaving from lodge)</li>\n<li>Take it easy, play in the falls and time it to take the helicopter\nout at noon.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>You should arrive at the hilltop at about the same time. You might\nconsider leaving a carefully packed cooler in the car with some dry ice\nand your favorite beverage to wait for your return.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<p>There are several spots along the campground where picnic tables have\nbeen set <em>in the watercourse</em>. Most of the times these are there\nto aid crossing of the stream, but some of these tables also make for a\nfantastic \"pool bar\" where you can rest legs and feet in the cool water\nwhile having a post-hike Happy Hour with your friends. Remember that\nalcohol is forbidden in the Indian reservation. We drank from Gatorade\nand Vitamin Water bottles.</p>\n<p><img src=\"poolbar.png\" title=\"poolbar.png\" alt=\"poolbar.png\" /> <img\nsrc=\"poolbar2.png\" title=\"poolbar2.png\" alt=\"poolbar2.png\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Special note for Colorado River rafters:</strong> In 2018,\nduring a 21-day rafting trip, we hiked up Havasu canyon after docking\nour boats at the confluence. We were stopped at Beaver Falls by a\nHavasupai guard with a walkie-talkie. He said that a daily entrance pass\nonto reservation land was $55pp, cash only. He would not take a credit\ncard (we believed it would have been technically possible for him to\ncall a cc number over his radio to charge from their office, but he\nwould not try it). Although we had enough money back at the boats, there\nwas no sign in the lower canyon advising us of the fee, and thus we did\nnot know of it when we started the 3 mile hike up, so of course we did\nnot have money on us. He turned all of our group back around the corner,\nout of sight of lower Beaver Falls. Keep this in mind if you are rafting\nand would like to visit the beautiful Havasupai land -- plan ahead\neither bringing cash or possibly arranging admission from the tribe in\nadvance of your rafting trip (although timing the exact date of arrival\nduring your rafting trip might be tricky).</p>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><img src=\"rwl_en.png\" title=\"rwl_en.png\" alt=\"rwl_en.png\" /><a\nhref=\"http://brennen.caltech.edu/swhikes/havasu.htm\">Chris Brennen's\nAdventure Hikes (Southwest)</a> : Havasu Canyon</li>\n<li><img src=\"rwl_en.png\" title=\"rwl_en.png\" alt=\"rwl_en.png\" /><a\nhref=\"http://toddshikingguide.com/Hikes/Arizona/GrandCanyon/Canyon8.htm\">ToddsHikingGuide.com</a>\n: Havasu Canyon</li>\n<li><img src=\"rwl_en.png\" title=\"rwl_en.png\" alt=\"rwl_en.png\" /><a\nhref=\"http://canyonchronicles.com/havasu-creek?kmlidx=217646538137783992549.0004e405e207c7a7551e2\">CanyonChronicles.com</a>\n: Havasu Creek</li>\n<li><img src=\"book.png\" title=\"book.png\" alt=\"book.png\" /><a\nhref=\"http://ropewiki.com/User:Grand_Canyoneering_Book?id=Havasu_Creek\">Grand\nCanyoneering Book by Todd Martin</a> : Havasu Creek</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n",
