A maintained trail leads down on the north side of the road, although it's easy to miss.  It's located right along the road about 50ft west of the parking area.  There may or may not be a sign indicating the way to the falls.  The Forest Service seems to have an ongoing war with the locals -- as soon as a new sign goes up, it promptly disappears.\n<\/p><p>The maintained trail switchbacks down to the top of a beautiful viewing platform overlooking the main falls.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Red_tape\">Red tape<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Please resist the temptation to run Panther Creek Falls. The area above and below the falls has been closed to entry after a hiker fell to her death in 2018.\n<\/p><p>Unlike other parts of the country, canyoning is not widely known or recognized in the Pacific Northwest.  Individuals climbing, rappelling, or slack-lining around such \"show waterfalls\" are far more likely to garner negative reactions from the general public at large.
