  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p><strong>WARNING: as of 30JAN2021 there has been major rockfall in\nUpper Deimos. The \"rubble room\" (rappel 3) floor has collapsed as a\nlandslide over the drop and rockfall danger persists. This part of the\ncanyon is not safe for travel. There is a work-around (see rappel 3\ndescription below). Lower Deimos via the Sneak route is ok.</strong></p>\n<p>This is <a\nhref=\"http://bluugnome.com/cyn_route/dv/dv_deimos/dv_deimos-canyon.aspx\">BluuGnome.com</a>\nfavorite Death Valley canyon, and several other seasoned Death Valley\ncanyoneers agree this is one of the best canyons in Death Valley. The\nsteep approach affords beautiful views of the salt encrusted Badwater\nBasin below.</p>\n<p>The approach to the canyon has exposed third class scrambling over\ntalus, scree, and crumbling rocks. In the first 1000 feet of climbing,\nthere are few unexposed places to rest, and the slope is around 100%\ngrade. <strong>If you are not confident with exposure, or are\nuncomfortable with heights and the potential for rock to crumble under\nyou on a steep, loose slope, this may not be the canyon for\nyou</strong>. Good route finding is necessary on the first part of the\napproach to avoid ending up in an adjacent ridge or canyon with a\ndifficult traverse to get back on track. Teams should be spaced so that\nno one is left behind. A handline might be necessary to help anyone who\ngets stuck.</p>\n<p>The canyon itself is narrow, with rock smoother than in the other\nranges. The rappels listed below is not necessarily the number all teams\nwill encounter depending on climbing skills. There are many fun\ndownclimbs that can be done with a strong climber and partner assist,\nbut less skilled climbers may require a meat anchor. Long sleeves or\nelbow padding are very helpful in the skinnier downclimbs.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>Waypoints in the KML map contain detailed descriptions of all the\nrappels (courtesy of <a\nhref=\"http://bluugnome.com/cyn_route/dv/dv_deimos/dv_deimos-canyon.aspx\">BluuGnome.com</a>).</p>\n<p>The rappels numbered here match with the .kml.

Approaching this anchor is\na bit exposed; can be done with a fixed/rappel line from further up the\ncanyon. From this anchor the rappel is safe, directly off the boulder\nand down a clean face. This anchor can be rebuilt with 30 to 40 feet of\nwebbing in place of rope around the horn.<br />\n<strong>Rap 3: Previous 95</strong>' from a under a large boulder \"the\nrubble room\" anchored off a chock stone DCR.
