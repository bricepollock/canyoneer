  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>Rock Creek is a major drainage flowing into the Columbia River in the\ntown of Stevenson. The upper headwaters of the creek, however, sports a\ncanyon with a number of waterfalls in quick succession. Rock Creek holds\ngood water late into the summer. Rock Creek would get run all the time\nif it weren't such a long hike in and out. Recommend an early start and\nbe prepared for a long day out.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>This page describes the classic approach to Rock Creek. Another\n\"shortcut\" approach would be to come in via <a\nhref=\"http://ropewiki.com/Alt-Rock_Creek\">Alt Rock</a>. This will drop\nyou in right above R4 in Rock Creek's technical section. Sadly, however,\nthis approach doesn't spare you the hike out.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<h3 id=\"directions_lower_trailhead\">Directions: Lower Trailhead</h3>\n<p>From the Bridge of the Gods, turn right on Hwy 14 and continue 1.5mi\neast to turn off left/north towards Skamania Lodge on Rock Creek Dr.\nTurn left again in 0.3mi onto SW Foster Creek Rd. Continue 0.4mi and\ncontinue straight onto SW Ryan Allen Rd for another 0.5mi before turning\nleft again onto Red Bluff Rd (becomes gravel). Follow Red Bluff Rd for\n5.7mi to a bridge across Rock Creek. (<a\nhref=\"http://ropewiki.com/Rock_Creek_(Tsolo_Scramble)#Extra_Bonus:_Steep_Creek_Falls\">Steep\nCreek Falls</a> is just upstream / left of the bridge.) Continue west on\nRed Bluff Rd for 1.5mi to a junction where the main road swings left to\ncross a second bridge over Rock Creek. (This is probably the best\ncheckpoint for flow on the creek.) Continue up the main road for another\n1.75mi to where the PCT crosses the road. Watch carefully as it’s not\nwell signed, but the trail is obvious.</p>\n<h3 id=\"directions_upper_trailhead\">Directions: Upper Trailhead</h3>\n<p>From the PCT trailhead, hike or short shuttle hop up the road about\n1mi to Rock Creek Pass where the road crosses the path and abruptly\nbegins to descend. Find a place to park off the road.</p>\n<h3 id=\"hiking_in\">Hiking In</h3>\n<p>From the pass, turn right on an ATV track that climbs steeply up the\nhill. The track winds around the southern end of a local high point and\nthen heads off northwest. The track is obvious and mostly easy to\nfollow; the going is pretty quick. Follow up and down along the\nridgecrest for about 3mi. On reaching about 3000ft elevation (approx UTM\n10 571947mE 5070147mN), break north off the road and descend wherever is\neasiest (bushwhack) down into the drainage. Expect somewhat thrashy\nforested terrain through huckleberry and vine maple, but it’s only a\nquarter-mile to the creek. We entered the creek about UTM 572121mE\n5070611mN.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>About 10min downstream encounter a short downclimb.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>R1: 35ft.</li>\n<li>R2: 20ft. Big plunge pool can be skirted DCL.</li>\n<li>R3: 50ft into a pool. A short distance downstream is a mandatory\npool.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Bit of a hike to the next falls.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Reach another drop (25ft). Can downclimb DCL or rappel.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Canyon opens up with an enormous slabby cliff-face visible on the\nright. Enter an area of bedrock: a giant ramp / cascade leading\ndownwards. Not far ahead a tributary enters on the left; this is\n\"Alt-Rock\". Ahead there are five waterfalls in the next 0.5mi. All of\nthe lower falls can be rappelled out of the water if the flow is\nhigh.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>R4: 35ft. Funnels into a slot with horsetail at the bottom.</li>\n<li>R5: 45ft highly photogenic falls.</li>\n<li>R6: 20ft. Use anchor DCL to drop down narrow chute to the right of\nthe main falls. Another deep pool below and interesting cave-like\nspace.</li>\n<li>R7: 45ft. Two-tier drop into a swimmer. Hanging pothole between the\ntiers is chest-deep.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Short walk from R7 to the next falls.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>R8: 30ft. Another giant plunge-pool at the bottom.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>Below the last falls it's a 2mi hike downstream to the PCT footbridge\n- so you may want to de-wetsuit. Expect it to take a couple of hours.\nThis is not your average streamwalk as there are numerous sections of\nbedrock, short narrows, giant boulder gardens, and a couple of logjam\nobstacles to keep you busy. You will pass the Indie-Rock and Post-Rock\ntributaries on the way out.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Logjam #1: Climb under a giant old-growth log DCR, then up on top of\nit. Use it as a ramp to do a descending traverse to the DCL side of the\nfalls and drop into a pool. Swimmer.</li>\n<li>Logjam #2: Bear DCR to find an easy way way to hike through the jam.\nThis one is relatively close to the footbridge.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When you see an obvious blue-green cliff DCL, you are approaching the\nend. Upon reaching the footbridge, easiest exit from the creek up to the\nbridge is DCL.</p>\n<p>Cross the bridge and follow the PCT SW (DCR), climbing steadily for\nabout 0.5mi to reach your car at the trailhead.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<p>While no signs are present, canyoners have been ticketed at the Lower\nParking area (PCT trailhead on Red Bluff Rd). Apparently a\n<em>Washington State Discovery Pass</em> is required for parking here.\nThe road is patrolled occasionally by the Washington State Department of\nNatural Resources (DNR).</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Tip: You can avoid the need for a pass by parking at the trailhead\nfor Alt Rock. This requires a slightly longer shuttle.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><img src=\"rwl_en.png\" title=\"rwl_en.png\" alt=\"rwl_en.png\" /><a\nhref=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20210527212206/www.canyoneeringnorthwest.com/RockCreek2/Rock_Creek.php\">CanyoneeringNorthwest.com\n(archive.org)</a> : Rock Creek</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n<p>The main stem of Rock Creek was likely first descended by Evan\nTopinka.
