{"id":508,"technicalRating":3,"latitude":38.781,"shuttleSeconds":null,"description":"<div class=\"mw-content-ltr mw-parser-output\" lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><p>The technical section is located within Arches NP and a permit is required.  Permits are obtained through Recreation.gov (see Red Tape section below).  Access is by driving up to I-70 and exiting Yellow Cat and passing through Yellow Cat Mesa.\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Getting_There\">Getting There<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Drive 19 mile on dirt road that has sand and a bumpy clearance section at the end. There are stories of cars getting stuck.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>From the parking area at the fence line, follow the dirt road west about 30 yards or so, and try to find the faint beginnings of the MMI drainage.  It can be hard to find at first but will become more defined.  As you cross the open desert here looking for the start of the drainage there isn't a clear path or use trail, so try to minimize damage to the land and plant life.  Once in the drainage continue to the head of the MMI canyon.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>The canyon has 3 raps off of natural anchors, but it is possible for R1 and R2 to be combined--though that might make for a difficult pull.  There is an alternative bolted anchor that skips the first, and potentially second anchor, but the writer of this beta has not used that anchor.  \n<\/p>\n<ul><li><b>R1:<\/b> Anchored from a single-leaf ash tree or cairn down a low angle slab that could also be downclimbed.<\/li>\n<li><b>R2:60’ <\/b> Anchored from a sling around a large boulder. This rappel lands atop a boulder filled ravine.  Go off rappel on top of the boulders and then pick your way over and through the rest of the boulders.<\/li>\n<li><b>R3: 12’ <\/b> anchored from a juniper about 40’ back shortly after a canyon comes in from the left.<\/li>\n<li><b>R3: 99 ft.<\/b> This is anchored from a tree quite a ways back and will require about 50 feet of webbing to build an anchor that will reach over the edge.  The edge is also severely rope grooved--from below it looks like a comb--and would be very easy to stick a rope here.  Make sure the quick link goes over the edge and test the pull here.<\/li><\/ul>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading3\"><h3 id=\"Poison_Ivy\">Poison Ivy<\/h3><\/div>\n<p>Once finished with the last rap, the rest of the MMI drainage is a hike-a-canyon section to the Exit Options.  Shortly after the last rap there is a 30-40’ section of canyon with poison ivy present.  Great care is needed to pass this section without brushing up against the ivy.  Furthermore, there are also brushy plants in this section with leaves that look like holly (fremont mahonia) and each point on each leaf has a spike. Trying to get through this section while avoiding the poison ivy means you will get accosted by the other sharp plants, but that is a much preferable alternative to a poison ivy rash. Make sure you know how to identify it before doing this canyon.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading3\"><h3 id=\"Climber's_Exit\"><span id=\"Climber.27s_Exit\"><\/span>Climber's Exit<\/h3><\/div>\n<p>The standard exit is up the official NPS-established \"Climbers Exit\" to the Covert Arch trail. Follow the MMI drainage until it opens up, keeping a lookout for a small foot path on the west that can be difficult to spot. There may or may not be a small NPS sign at the path way.  If you get to the junction of Lost and Found Canyon and the Hiker's Exit canyon you have gone past the Climber's Exit and will need to back track.  \n<\/p><p>Once you find the start of the Climbers' Exit proceed up the path staying on the slickrock. The exit slab climb is approximately 80’ of class 4 exposure (fairly easy with careful foot placements (rarely need to use hands), but a slip\/fall would have severe consequences).  There are 3 bolts to protect this section and it is possible for a leader to belay others up.  Above this section go up to a wall and then traverse left to exit to the rim.  The Climbers Exit is not recommended when wet or snow covered as it would be hazardous if not impossible to exit under those conditions. If using the climbing route up the slab, there will be a use trail along the rim back to the car. Look for rocks and park signs for the use trail to avoid stepping on the cryptobiotic soil and vegetation.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading3\"><h3 id=\"Hiker's_Exit\"><span id=\"Hiker.27s_Exit\"><\/span>Hiker's Exit<\/h3><\/div>\n<p>Alternatively the canyon can be exited via the Hiker's Exit to the Lost Spring Hiker's Exit Trailhead.  This is also known as the Long, or Winter Exit as it is the route required to exit if ice, snow, or water is present on the Climber's Exit.  This exit option will require setting up a car shuttle in advance, however.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Red_Tape\">Red Tape<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading3\"><h3 id=\"Permits\">Permits<\/h3><\/div>\n<p>A permit is required for any and all canyoneering within the boundaries of Arches National Park.  Permits have group-size limits that varies depending on canyon or route.  Permits cost $6 for a group and currently there is no quota limit, but that might change at some point in the future.  A separate permit is required for each canyoneering route.\n<\/p><p>Permits must be obtained online through the link below and are available online 8:00AM MT one day in advance up to 5:00PM MT the day of the trip.
