All bolted. The rock can be quite grippy due to mineral accretion but don't rely on that as there are plenty of slippery moss patches. It's a good idea to rig a handline for R3. The PG is for the hanging pool (\"marmita\") on R4. Although probably escapable through a small hole partway down, it would take the rope through the hole and might be difficult. Better to avoid it LDC. R5 was a particularly difficult pull for us, it might be a good idea to extend the rap ring away from the hangers with some webbing. Some other raps had hard pulls due to anchor placement.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Continue down the creek, enjoying a short toboggan and some small jumps.

At least, explain what you're doing to anyone you come across and ask if it's ok if you continue.
