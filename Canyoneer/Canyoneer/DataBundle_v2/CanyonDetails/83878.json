This yielded the discovery of a breathtaking tableland on Mt Glennie covered in ferns, palm trees and walking stick palms. The ridgeline up was difficult - kilometers of Lantana. Because of this, we ran out of time to descend into the main event of the canyon. We were able to abseil the first waterfall, approximately 55-60 meters of rope used. The section immediately below this fall contained ~100m of creek hopping covered in giant rocks, gaps in the rocks showed evidence of a possible river cave existing there. Below this is what is expected to be the main canyon. The only section o seen was what looked like multi-tier falls (extremely steep cascades), which looked like 2x50m pitches (due to the angle). No good natural anchors were seen near the edge of the first of these falls. Future exhibitions should access the top of the plateau via the creek with a walk up the ridge on creek left.\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Red_tape\">Red tape<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Beta_sites\">Beta sites<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media<\/h2><\/div>\n<ul><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/1ahhJ6Y0FUM\">YouTube.com<\/a>&#160;: Trapped In Paradise, Terrace Creek<\/li><\/ul>\n<p><br \/>\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Background\">Background<\/h2><\/div>\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nParsed by mw‐api‐ext.codfw.main‐6779cc57fc‐xl2fx\nCached time: 20240914191815\nCache expiry: 2592000\nReduced expiry: false\nComplications: [show‐toc]\nCPU time usage: 0.006 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.007 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 21\/1000000\nPost‐expand include size: 0\/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 0\/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 2\/100\nExpensive parser function count: 0\/500\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0\/20\nUnstrip post‐expand size: 0\/5000000 bytes\nNumber of Wikibase entities loaded: 0\/400\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%    0.000      1 -total\n-->\n<\/div>","id":83878,"rappelLongestMeters":null,"technicalRating":null,"timeRating":null,"url":"https:\/\/ropewiki.com\/Exordium_Canyon","months":[],"riskRating":null,"geojson":null,"shuttleSeconds":null,"version":"edcbb750afff60f6c98a96faa931a2135aefa7985b6da7d5711398e64aefb6a6","rappelCountMin":null}
