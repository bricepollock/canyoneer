  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>A reece was undertaken to explore the prospect of a canyon existing\non Terrace creek. This yielded the discovery of a breathtaking tableland\non Mt Glennie covered in ferns, palm trees and walking stick palms. The\nridgeline up was difficult - kilometers of Lantana. Because of this, we\nran out of time to descend into the main event of the canyon. We were\nable to abseil the first waterfall, approximately 55-60 meters of rope\nused. The section immediately below this fall contained ~100m of creek\nhopping covered in giant rocks, gaps in the rocks showed evidence of a\npossible river cave existing there. Below this is what is expected to be\nthe main canyon. The only section o seen was what looked like multi-tier\nfalls (extremely steep cascades), which looked like 2x50m pitches (due\nto the angle). No good natural anchors were seen near the edge of the\nfirst of these falls. Future exhibitions should access the top of the\nplateau via the creek with a walk up the ridge on creek left.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><img src=\"rwl_en.png\" title=\"rwl_en.png\" alt=\"rwl_en.png\" /><a\nhref=\"https://youtu.be/1ahhJ6Y0FUM\">YouTube.com</a> : Trapped In\nParadise, Terrace Creek</li>\n</ul>\n<p>{{#ev:youtube|1ahhJ6Y0FUM}}</p>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n",
