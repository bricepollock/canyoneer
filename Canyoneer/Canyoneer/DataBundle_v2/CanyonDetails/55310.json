The canyon walls are made of a haphazard fusing of eroding basalt columns and often the canyon is only wide enough to accommodate one person. Those from the Southwest might enjoy the challenge of stemming portions of the canyon. \n<\/p><p>Beware of ticks in the area. For those particularly sedentary (efficient or tired), a 0.5 mile shuttle can be setup. There is an abundance of dispersed campgrounds in the area, even some with outdoor toilets! The map has 2 campsites marked: 1. Camping right next to the canyon (GPS point labeled 'Devil's Canyon Campsite\/Park') and 2. Camping with a view of the river and hoodoo wall (GPS point labeled 'Camping').\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>From the point labeled 'Devil's Canyon Campsite\/Park', proceed straight towards the creek and enjoy possibly the shortest approach in the PNW.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>R1: 120' DCR. The anchor has been set low due to the crumbly nature of the rock. The anchor could be difficult to reach in high low. Look out for the American Dipper nest behind the waterfall.
