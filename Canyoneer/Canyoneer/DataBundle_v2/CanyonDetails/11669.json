MGA556726\n<\/p><p>Follow the Fortress Ridge fire trail. Head right where the road forks after about 700m.\nAfter another 700m you will see an old fire road heading off to your right. Ignore this and instead continue west along the Fortress Ridge walking track.\nAfter 500m on this track, turn right onto a foot track that heads north, then NE, down a ridge. Continue for approximately 1km before arriving at the creek.\nIf you are wearing wetsuits you can put them on here, but in warm weather you are better off following the creek downstream until you need to start wading.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Walk alongside the creek, or walk in it where you need to, occasionally climbing over branches, logs and rocks.\nThe first, short section of canyon starts with a short down climb that can also be jumped, followed immediately by a 20m swim. The canyon opens up again following this.\nThe next section of canyon starts with a scramble down a large boulder that takes you to a 2m water jump.\nAfter some more scrambling and wading you come to the third and most impressive canyon constriction. It starts with a 6m abseil from a bolt on the left hand side of the canyon. This can also be jumped, but the water is not particularly deep (usually less than 2m) and there are rocks that need to be avoided.\nAfter some more swimming and scrambling the canyon comes to an end. Continue along the creek for about 100m to the very end, where it plunges over an impressive waterfall. This is a spectacular spot for lunch.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Exit. The canyon ends at the top of a 70m waterfall, MGA427752 with great views.\nTo exit go back upstream 50m and exit on to easy track to the west, keep left at the top cliff line to access the Fortress Ridge Track and follow that back to car. There are some spectacular views available from the track, or with a quick detour onto The Fortress.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Red_tape\">Red tape<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Beta_sites\">Beta sites<\/h2><\/div>\n<p><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external free\" href=\"https:\/\/ozultimate.com\/canyoning\/track_notes\/fortress.htm\">https:\/\/ozultimate.com\/canyoning\/track_notes\/fortress.htm<\/a>\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media<\/h2><\/div>\n<p><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external free\" href=\"https:\/\/sleepwhenwearedead.net\/2016\/01\/10\/empress-and-fortress-canyons-10-01-16\/\">https:\/\/sleepwhenwearedead.net\/2016\/01\/10\/empress-and-fortress-canyons-10-01-16\/<\/a>\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Background\">Background<\/h2><\/div>\n\n\n<\/div>","waterRating":"B","vehicle":"Passenger","latitude":-33.6445,"id":11669,"longitude":150.3593,"months":["Dec","Jan","Feb","Mar"],"riskRating":null,"timeRating":"III","technicalRating":3,"name":"Fortress","url":"https:\/\/ropewiki.com\/Fortress","rappelLongestMeters":6}
