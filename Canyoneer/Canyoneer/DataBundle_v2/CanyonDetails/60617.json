It is recommended to use a Fiddle-stick on this rappel due to how far back the anchor is from the edge, but if you do, you'll need a full 200 feet of rope to reach the bottom. If you are short at all you won't make it, so it's best to have your rope a little over 200ft.  \n<link rel=\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\" href=\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1062633282\"> \n<\/p>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\">\n<div style=\"display:table;\">\n<span class=\"mw-default-size\" typeof=\"mw:Error mw:File\/Frameless\">\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>The rappel is two-stage, with the first stage being less than 20 feet, leading to the pour-off where the rappel becomes free-hanging for most of its remaining length.
