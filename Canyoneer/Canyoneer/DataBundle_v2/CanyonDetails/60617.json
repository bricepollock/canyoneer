The canyon above the alcove is nothing more than a glorified pour-off, though it does slot-up and provide some views worth seeing if you are in the area.  It is located in the same general area as <a href=\"\/w\/index.php?title=Crumbling_Canyon&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Crumbling Canyon (page does not exist)\">Crumbling Canyon<\/a>, and can be combined with it for a more worthwhile outing.\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Park before the Forest Service gate and hike along highway 6 until at the base of the approach gully.  As you head up the approach gully, stay to the right as it forks and continue up a very narrow and steep chute resembling a slot canyon itself.  Escape out of the gully to your right as soon as the cliffs permit it and contour southeast around the hillside, descending down into the drainage when it is visible.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Heading down canyon, you will encounter a few down-climbs as the canyon quickly deepens. \n<style data-mw-deduplicate=\"TemplateStyles:r1062633282\">@media all and (max-width:720px){.mw-parser-output .content .thumb>div:not(.thumbinner){display:flex;justify-content:center;flex-wrap:wrap;align-content:flex-start;flex-direction:column}}body.skin-vector .mw-parser-output div.thumb>div:not(.thumbinner){font-size:94%;text-align:center;overflow:hidden;min-width:100px}body.skin-minerva .mw-parser-output div.thumb>div:not(.thumbinner){margin:0 auto;max-width:100%!important}<\/style> \n<\/p>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\">\n<div style=\"display:table;\">\n<span class=\"mw-default-size\" typeof=\"mw:Error mw:File\/Frameless\">\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>The down-climbs will lead to a chamber before the final drop to the alcove.  This chamber should have a large piece of lumber across it serving as an anchor for the final and only rappel.  It is recommended to use a Fiddle-stick on this rappel due to how far back the anchor is from the edge, but if you do, you'll need a full 200 feet of rope to reach the bottom. If you are short at all you won't make it, so it's best to have your rope a little over 200ft.  \n<link rel=\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\" href=\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1062633282\"> \n<\/p>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\">\n<div style=\"display:table;\">\n<span class=\"mw-default-size\" typeof=\"mw:Error mw:File\/Frameless\">\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>The rappel is two-stage, with the first stage being less than 20 feet, leading to the pour-off where the rappel becomes free-hanging for most of its remaining length.
