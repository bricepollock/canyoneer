  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>The alcove making up the most prominent feature of Cobble Cave\nCanyon, is very visible for those heading southbound on highway 6, and\nis often visited from the bottom by intrigued motorists. The canyon\nabove the alcove is nothing more than a glorified pour-off, though it\ndoes slot-up and provide some views worth seeing if you are in the area.\nIt is located in the same general area as <a href=\"Crumbling_Canyon\"\ntitle=\"wikilink\">Crumbling Canyon</a>, and can be combined with it for a\nmore worthwhile outing.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>Park before the Forest Service gate and hike along highway 6 until at\nthe base of the approach gully. As you head up the approach gully, stay\nto the right as it forks and continue up a very narrow and steep chute\nresembling a slot canyon itself. Escape out of the gully to your right\nas soon as the cliffs permit it and contour southeast around the\nhillside, descending down into the drainage when it is visible.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>Heading down canyon, you will encounter a few down-climbs as the\ncanyon quickly deepens. The down-climbs will lead to a chamber before\nthe final drop to the alcove. This chamber should have a large piece of\nlumber across it serving as an anchor for the final and only rappel. It\nis recommended to use a Fiddle-stick on this rappel due to how far back\nthe anchor is from the edge, but if you do, you'll need a full 200 feet\nof rope to reach the bottom. If you are short at all you won't make it,\nso it's best to have your rope a little over 200ft. The rappel is\ntwo-stage, with the first stage being less than 20 feet, leading to the\npour-off where the rappel becomes free-hanging for most of its remaining\nlength. The rappel is very scenic, but communication can be difficult\nwith the sound of traffic on highway 6 below. </p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>Simply walk out of the alcove and follow social trails back to\nhighway 6, following it back to your vehicle.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<p>None</p>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n<p>The Canyon cuts through Cretaceous Conglomerate, which was deposited\nduring the Sevier Orogeny, similar to the famous <a\nhref=\"Box_Canyon_(Maple_Canyon)\" title=\"wikilink\">Maple Canyon</a> of\nSanpete County. The water smoothed cobbles of this conglomerate are\nPrecambrian Quartzite and Paleozoic Limestone, which are some of the\noldest exposed rocks of the region.</p>\n",
