  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>From the Mureung Valley Parking Area:-</p>\n<p>There are plenty of Maps on the trails. You’re looking to take the\nblue trail (which is number 3). Don’t be misled by signs to Yongchu\nFalls. Aim for marker 3-3 on this trail. After climbing a steep metal\nstairway you will come to a fork in the path. A sign points left to\n‘Love Rock’ or forwards and down towards Cheongoksan. Head towards\nCheongoksan. When the trail meets the stream – your descent begins.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>From the trail, the descent is quite straight forward at first; just\na succession of wet scrambles. There are no conservation issues or\nenvironmental concerns. You will occasionally find initials carved into\nthe rocks or small abandoned items like broken sunglasses – suggesting\nthat people frequently use this place to dodge the crowds on the main\ntrail. After 200m you will come to the main feature of the canyon; a\nshort slot section that consists of 3 drops in quick succession. There\nare no ‘accessible’ bolts to use (at the top of the second drop there is\nan old piton placed in a crack above what could possibly be reached by\nhand). The first jump is a straight forward 7-8m drop into a deep, black\nplunge pool. If you want to set up a line, you can scramble up the ledge\nto the left of the drop, and use the largest tree there. It sets up a\nperfect line for the abseil and for retrieval. This ledge also allows\nfor the option of making a bigger jump. You needn’t have any concerns\nabout the depth of the plunge pool – it is definitely over 5m deep. The\nsecond jump is a little bit more intimidating. The launch is a little\nwet and slippery. You also have quite a narrow target to aim for. We did\nthis descent in low water levels (there was less than one inch depth to\nthe water going over the fall), but you could see from the top where the\ndeepest part of the pool was – where all the leaves had settled in the\nstill pool. The jump is about 11m. There are no options for natural\nanchors on this drop (bear that it mind). The third drop is Yongchu\nFalls; a popular picnic spot for hikers and families. This pool is also\nrelatively shallow – and more subject to change as the river bed is made\nup of boulders here. There is an option for a tree anchor on river left\nhere (but you’ll need a rope longer than the 9-10m of Yongchu Falls.\nAfter this, the descent is much less technical. It consists of wet\nscrambles down to Ssang Falls. Then there is a shallow swim through a\nnice little gorge, and then you’ll want to egress river right. There\nwould be little value left in sticking to the stream from this point\nonwards.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>Take the main trail back to the car park. It is all well signposted.\nJust keep heading down.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<p>Parking Fee : ₩ 6,000 / Admission Fees: ₩ 2,000 per Adult</p>\n<p>Access is prohibited. And this is enforced. Strictly. Hikers in the\narea will alert the rangers, who do patrol regularly. There is some\npotential for severe fines if you wilfully and blatantly disregard the\nNational Park rules. As soon as you’re at the second jump you will be in\nview of anyone who is on the trail.</p>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a\nhref=\"https://www.google.com/maps/d/edit?hl=en&amp;authuser=0&amp;mid=1V-S2aDtsrLaYjmVQleNdVAvotKQ\">https://www.google.com/maps/d/edit?hl=en&amp;authuser=0&amp;mid=1V-S2aDtsrLaYjmVQleNdVAvotKQ</a></li>\n<li><a\nhref=\"https://www.facebook.com/koreancanyoning/\">https://www.facebook.com/koreancanyoning/</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a\nhref=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h8vG1G8Oq6s\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h8vG1G8Oq6s</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n<p>Unbolted</p>\n"
