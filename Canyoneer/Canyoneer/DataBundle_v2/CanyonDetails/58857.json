Avoid swimming too close to the dangerous geysers as your figurine may be launched skyward only to fall back into the pool.  Watch out the current is very swift at the top of the rock and could sweep your figurine off the slaby rock and over the 1000mm drop!  Since there are no bolt installed yet, your figurine will have to come up with some clever rigging to rappel R1.  Alternately, you can tie your figurine on some para-cord with a clove hitch and lower him(her) down the very sporty R1 directly in the full brunt of the waterfall.  After R1 is another good swim across the middle pool to R2.  R2 is not as tall at about 600mm, but presents similar hazards.  After R2 is the biggest pool, where your figurine can swim as much as desired until exiting anywhere along the pools spacious banks.\n<\/p><p>If your figurine is properly trained in jumping from such extreme heights (1000mm), he(she) can dispense with any technical gear for the canyon run.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Cross back over the flower bed, then the grass back to the sidewalk.
