  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>This is a perfect canyon for your favorite little figurine to\npractice in extreme water flow. The flow is ultra stable at class C4\nthanks to a sizable electric pump that recirculates the water through\nits 3 massive pools.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>Park at the Foothill Ranch Library, walk North to a sidewalk going\nEast, go East to Rue de Fortune, then South until you see the big\ngeysers on your right. Cross the grass, try not to trample the flowers\nat the edge of the top pool.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>Have your figurine swim out to the top of R1. Avoid swimming too\nclose to the dangerous geysers as your figurine may be launched skyward\nonly to fall back into the pool. Watch out the current is very swift at\nthe top of the rock and could sweep your figurine off the slaby rock and\nover the 1000mm drop! Since there are no bolt installed yet, your\nfigurine will have to come up with some clever rigging to rappel R1.\nAlternately, you can tie your figurine on some para-cord with a clove\nhitch and lower him(her) down the very sporty R1 directly in the full\nbrunt of the waterfall. After R1 is another good swim across the middle\npool to R2. R2 is not as tall at about 600mm, but presents similar\nhazards. After R2 is the biggest pool, where your figurine can swim as\nmuch as desired until exiting anywhere along the pools spacious\nbanks.</p>\n<p>If your figurine is properly trained in jumping from such extreme\nheights (1000mm), he(she) can dispense with any technical gear for the\ncanyon run.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>Cross back over the flower bed, then the grass back to the sidewalk.\nHike uphill (North) following your approach path back to your car.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<p>I think my favorite figurine took a beating on the first descent: <a\nhref=\"https://www.facebook.com/willie.hunt.735/videos/10220051034618896/\">https://www.facebook.com/willie.hunt.735/videos/10220051034618896/</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n",
