Using a shortcut up the west side of the West fork after finishing the Left or East fork bypasses the longer hike that is normally used to get the top of the West fork. This is a description of a trip route rather than the beta for the individual canyons.  There is already excellent beta for the Shillelagh canyons from several providers listed below.   \nBoth forks have as their highlights two rappels followed by some easy romping through some nice but short slot sections making these canyons perfect for those looking for an easier day or for beginners looking for a great canyon.   With that in mind, combining both forks with a shortcut approach, concentrates the fun, the rappels, and the cool scenery into a half or at the latest a leisurely three quarter day.\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Follow the route provided by one of the beta providers listed below for the right or East fork of Shillelagh. They all use the same route. Upon finishing the left or East fork, once down canyon at the confluence with the left or West Fork, walk up the West fork canyon about  100 yards to where some easily climbed ledges appear.  From here it is an easy climb up to the ridge.   Follow the edge up canyon to where there is a down climb back into the canyon floor and just above the first rappel.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2
