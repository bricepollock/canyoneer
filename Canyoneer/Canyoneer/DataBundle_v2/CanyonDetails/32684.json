  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>The Class 4 rating is for the anchor-building requirement, as two of\nthe anchors are deadmen in the watercourse.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Trailhead:</strong> <em>38.12051,-108.85757</em></li>\n<li><strong>Approach Breakdown:</strong>\n<em>38.12329,-108.84551</em></li>\n<li><strong>Road:</strong> <em>38.12637,-108.84192</em></li>\n<li><strong>Head of Canyon:</strong> <em>38.12963,-108.84505</em></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>From the Trailhead, hike east cross-country for about 500 feet past a\nsmall butte and steep hillside strewn with white rocks. Head north up\nthe wide ravine to the Breakdown in the caprock. This breakdown is an\neasy scramble to gain the top layer of rock. Once on top of the mesa,\nhead due north for about 1/2 mile to a dirt road. Go left on the dirt\nroad to the Head of the Canyon.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>After about 1/4 mile of pleasant creek-walking, an obvious drop is\nreached. This is best set up as a 2-stage rappel in order to facilitate\nthe rope-pull. The anchor is a deadman on the right side of a\nsand-filled pothole and the rappel drops 60 feet into a hanging pothole\nwith a large chockstone blocking the exit. The second stage of the\nrappel is done by re-rigging and rappelling off this chockstone, which\ndrops 90 feet to the floor. All of the passengers can be sent down from\nthe top anchor on a 150-foot rappel, but the rope pull does not seem\npossible without the last person doing it in two stages. Before the\nfinal rappel, several downclimbs, one through a rabbit hole, and one\ndown a long crack on the left are encountered. The final rappel is off a\ndeadman anchor and drops 60 feet, in front of two pools, the lower one\nin the shape of a heart. The rest of the canyon can be downclimbed.</p>\n<p>==Exit= Boulder-hop down the drainage down until it flattens out and\nyou should be able to see the cars.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n",
