A great one to do on a rainy day when everything else is running at flood stage.  Super short and can be run in a couple hours even in the rain.  Don't bother later in spring, summer or fall.  It's not worth your time.  You've been warned.\n<\/p>\n<ul><li>Watershed: 0.9mi^2.<\/li><\/ul>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>From the parking area, head down the slope to the south until you intercept an overgrown logging grade (maybe 100ft away).  Head upstream a short distance, then drop down to meet the creek. Head downstream wherever is easiest to the top of R1.  There's some nice bedrock just above the falls.  Current can be pushy in flood conditions.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<ul><li>R1: 100ft from a tree DCR.  A doubled 200ft rope will just make it to the bottom from the anchor.<\/li><\/ul>\n<p>Head downstream and practice your parkour skills getting over, under and through a few log jams.  Use caution approaching R2.\n<\/p>\n<ul><li>R2: 50ft from a tree DCL.  An anchor further back will better position you in the flow.  In 2021 there was a lot of debris at the bottom of the falls.<\/li><\/ul>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Looking downstream from R2, note the mossy ridge immediately DCL.  This is your exit ramp.  Follow it all the way back up to the road (~300ft elevation gain).  Keep going until you run into the road and walk back to your cars.  You will cross the old logging grade on the way.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Red_tape\">Red tape<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>None.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Beta_sites\">Beta sites<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Background\">Background<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>First descent was in January 2021 by Kevin Clark, Wade Hewitt, Ashley Driscoll, and Wim Aarts.\n<\/p>\n<ul><li>Some history on the name <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http:\/\/www.foresthiker.com\/?p=3527\">Lousignont<\/a>.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n<\/div>","shuttleSeconds":null,"id":63019,"riskRating":null,"rappelLongestMeters":30.48,"name":"Lousignont Creek","months":["Dec","Jan","Feb"],"vehicle":"Passenger","geojson":{"type":"FeatureCollection","features":[{"properties":{"name":"Parking"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"coordinates":[[-123.37204456329347,45.74519333849382,0]],"type":"Point"}},{"geometry":{"type":"LineString","coordinates":[[-123.37202310562135,45.74520082561745,0],[-123.37213039398195,45.74518585136917,0],[-123.37262392044069,45.74513344146857,0],[-123.37298870086671,45.74530564524294,0],[-123.3733642101288,45.745425438859606,0],[-123.37366461753847,45.74553774514179,0],[-123.37408304214479,45.74561261587106,0],[-123.37428689002992,45.745552719295695,0],[-123.37434053421022,45.74544790013412,0],[-123.37428689002992,45.74530564524294,0]]},"properties":{"stroke":"#00CD00","name":"Approach"},"type":"Feature"},{"properties":{"name":"Descent","stroke":"#FF0000"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"coordinates":[[-123.3742654323578,45.74529815813335,0],[-123.37399721145631,45.74517087711687,0],[-123.37354660034181,45.745036108665474,0],[-123.37326765060426,45.744833955378326,0],[-123.37310671806337,45.7446243141592,0],[-123.37287068367006,45.74438472323049,0],[-123.37273120880128,45.74424246563006,0],[-123.37258100509645,45.7441002076671,0]],"type":"LineString"}},{"properties":{"name":"Exit","stroke":"#A200FF"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"LineString","coordinates":[[-123.37251663208009,45.74411518220659,0],[-123.37250590324403,45.744392210462586,0],[-123.37244153022766,45.7446093397563,0],[-123.37243080139162,45.74474410923797,0],[-123.3724629878998,45.74490882705151,0],[-123.37216258049013,45.745073544379046,0],[-123.37207674980165,45.74517087711687,0]]}}]},"waterRating":"C","rappelCountMin":2,"longitude":-123.3721,"permit":"No","version":"9732cac922d6e1214ddf7c81cffd01be2a90c5c5060a2e3963f09f74d4db9aa2","url":"https:\/\/ropewiki.com\/Lousignont_Creek","quality":2,"technicalRating":3}
