Unfortunately, people have dumped trash off the cliff above which has accumulated in the canyon over the years, included a crashed motorcycle (intro photo).  The full route adds one more bad down climb or 25 foot rappel (R0) and a half mile of bushwhacking in a creek bed.  Descending the erosion gully for the sneak route bypasses most all the bushwhacking and gets quickly to the rocky canyon part.  The times listed are for the sneak route vs. the full route instead of the normal range.\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>From Trabuco Canyon road where it crosses the Trabuco Canyon wash, follow the dirt and gravel road 1.9 miles to a spot with a loop pull-off on the North side.  Park there, off the main road as there is a parking restriction on the main road.  Hike up Cadillac Grade road which goes West (not straight up the erosion slope due North) from the parking area.  For the sneak route, follow Cadillac Grade for 0.66 miles (450 foot gain) to an erosion gully with a telephone pole in it.  Or for the full route hike 1.47 miles (1100 foot gain) to a sharp bend back West.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>From the erosion gully (sneak route) down climb 100 feet down, approx 300 feet horizontal to the main creek.  Hike down the creek (minimal bushwhacking) a bit until you get in the the good part of the canyon.  The low angle and short R1 requires 50 feet of rope, because the anchor point LDC is far back.  After passing along all the trash in the best part of the canyon, you quickly reach the 55 foot R2, which starts low angle, but drops 30 feet quite steep.  At the bottom is the crashed motorcycle.  From the road (full route) traverse over into the creek bed above a giant oak tree down stream.  Bushwhack your way down stream a half mile with the crumbly R0 about 1\/3 way down. Bring a strong pair of tree limb loppers if you choose the full route!\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Hike down canyon for 5 minutes, exit right
