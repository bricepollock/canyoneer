Gingercake Creek Canyon, on the eastern flank of the Linville Gorge Wilderness, has been equipped to run in true Class C fashion. There are 5-6 rappels, a small jump, and a couple swimmers - all within a 0.3 mile stretch of rugged creek terrain! The first 2 rappels are more or less interesting depending on water levels, but the rest of it is as good as it gets in NC and are absolute classics. For full value, head out when flow is up - but be prepared for some added spice during the final 3 raps!\n<\/p><p>Gingercake makes a great training ground for rigging and efficiency practice, as well as general team dynamics. Depending on your team's overall proficiency, this half-day creek can easily be combined with other nearby routes for a mega day outing. Wetsuit is strongly advised, but you could get by without one in the dead of summer if you move quickly and have a high tolerance for cold water.\n<\/p>\n<style data-mw-deduplicate=\"TemplateStyles:r1062633282\">@media all and (max-width:720px){.mw-parser-output .content .thumb>div:not(.thumbinner){display:flex;justify-content:center;flex-wrap:wrap;align-content:flex-start;flex-direction:column}}body.skin-vector .mw-parser-output div.thumb>div:not(.thumbinner){font-size:94%;text-align:center;overflow:hidden;min-width:100px}body.skin-minerva .mw-parser-output div.thumb>div:not(.thumbinner){margin:0 auto;max-width:100%!important}<\/style> \n<div class=\"thumb tright\">\n<div style=\"display:table;\">\n<span class=\"mw-default-size\" typeof=\"mw:Error mw:File\/Frameless\">\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Access FR 496 from HWY 181 near the Brown Mountain Overlook, and head west for 3.15 miles - at which point you'll come to the intersection with FS4060 (a permanently gated road). Park here at the obvious, grassy pull out - which is big enough for 4-5 cars depending on how you park. Gingercake Creek Canyon is directly below the forest road. From the western most side of the parking, start heading into the forest and down the mountain. Initially, you'll be able to follow a faint game path for the first 1\/3-1\/2, but eventually it will be swallowed by the jungles of the American Southeast. At that point, just follow the path of least resistance until you hit the creek. Full disclosure: the last 1\/3 of the approach is extremely dense with rhododendron. Staying \"more right\" on the way down should keep you out of the thickest spots, but it's still going to be thick regardless. Once on the creek, you'll be either right at the head of the canyon (the first rappel) or less than 50 yards upstream of it. Typically folks suit up at the cars, before the approach, then harness\/gear up at the creek.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Pro Tip: Once you hit the creek after the initial approach, stay in the watercourse for the rest of the canyon for maximum fun!\n<\/p>\n<ul><li><b>R1<\/b>: 35ft (11m).
