  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>The most straightforward access is via Sunday Creek Rd from the\nMaleny-Kenilworth Rd. Stay on Sunday Creek Rd through Charlie Moreland\nCampground, ignoring the forestry side-roads. Continue up onto the\nridge, and look for a NPWS sign ‘Dry Sclerophyll Forest’. Park anywhere\naround this sign you can find space; there is a small pull-over in the\nnext saddle. Proceed to the crest immediately south of the Dry\nSclerophyll sign, and there is a small cairn at 462145 7054485 on the\nwestern side of the road that marks the start of a shortcut track across\nthe gully to the Great Walk track. Take this, and when you hit the Great\nWalk turn left. Follow the Great Walk to a signposted side track that\nleads down to the top of the falls (461243 7054397).</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>P1 (Summer Falls), 32m- from a sling around an ironbark on the TR\nimmediately adjacent to the access track to the top of the falls, on a\nledge up above the actual platform at the top of the falls themselves.\nThis is a poor location for an anchor, but there are no other decent\noptions that allow a line through the flow. Get on rope at the actual\nlip of the falls, not the anchor, which produces about a 15m pitch.\nNeeds bolting, but is an extremely sensitive location for it. It is\nworthwhile bringing replacement anchor in case removed by NPWS.</p>\n<p>P2 (Summer Falls), 33m- from a sling around a fig on the TL, climb\nacross the flow and out onto a little ledge. The second half of this\npitch is through the flow, and could be dangerous in moderate flow. P2\nlands in a deep pool, with a 7m cascade on the other side. WARNING- both\npitches down Summer Falls have sharp rock, be careful with your rope\nmanagement.</p>\n<p>P3, 16m- Boulder hop through a short, inescapable gorge (easiest TL),\nand then swim across a 30m pool. P3 is immediately around the corner.\nFiddlestick (or bring a sling+maillon) off the large eucalypt on the TR.\nCan be downclimbed TL with care. Short deep pool.</p>\n<p>P4, 18m- Immediately following the P3 pool, from a single expansion\nbolt on rock face TR. Line goes right down low-velocity cascade. Has\navoidable pool at base. Can be scrambled.</p>\n<p>P5, 15m- Immediately following the P4 pool, has avoidable swim at\nbase. No anchors, and no great options for naturals, but there are two\nholes for concrete screws (Hilti HUS-3H 6x65mm screws) at the top of the\npitch on the TL, plugged with parsnips. Can be scrambled.</p>\n<p>P6 and P7- These are currently not bolted, but are 2x approximately\n5m cascades immediately after P5. Could be bolted for 12-15m pitches,\nbut can be easily downclimbed.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>There are two straightforward options:</p>\n<p>1. Continue downstream from P5, until you reach the nose of the TR\nridge directly in front of you (around 460997 7054877). Exit up this\nextremely steep, untracked, but fairly open ridge until you hit an old\nfiretrail. Follow that though a clearing back to Sunday Ck Rd. Turn\nright, and eventually you’ll find your car.</p>\n<p>2. Scramble back up to the top of P3, and there is an exit ridge on\nthe TR (461209 7054591. This ridge is steep, but has a faint footpad. It\nwill take you back to the Great Walk, turn left and retrace your steps\nvia the shortcut track to your car.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n",
