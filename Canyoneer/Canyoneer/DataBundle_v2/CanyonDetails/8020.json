  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>The insurgence to the cave is very big, about 10 to 15 m wide and 25\nto 30 m tall. In the dry season, the river is big enough to form rapids\nover the rocks. In the wet season, the local people say the entire\nentrance is submerged and a lake is formed. The resurgence is about 0.7\nkm away straightline distance, and the survey of the cave passage was\nwell over 1 km.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>There is a pit that intersects the cave about 1/3 of the way through.\nIt is possible to do a through-trip, but much rigging is required to\nstay out of the fast-moving parts of the river. The coordinates are for\ninsurgence.</p>\n<p>There is an article on the exploration of Cueva del Río San Ramón\n(including maps) in the NSS News March 1993 issue</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><img src=\"rwl_en.png\" title=\"rwl_en.png\" alt=\"rwl_en.png\" /><a\nhref=\"http://speleosphere.org/index.php?content=showcave&amp;id=9963023\">Speleosphere.org</a>\n: Cueva del Río San Ramón</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n",
