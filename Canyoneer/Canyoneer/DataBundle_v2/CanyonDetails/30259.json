The full route for Cibecue Creek is surely more beautiful and interesting but may require an overnight bivy and special arrangements with the guide. On it's own, Tank is a worthwhile trip containing a couple down climbs, a slide into a pool, a swim, several nice rappels and ending in a very scenic view overlooking Cibecue Creek.\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>A long rock hopping hike down a dry creek bed for approximately 5 miles with a couple easy down climbs and several still pools that can be avoided. The approach will take approximately 2.5 to 3 hours.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<ul><li><b>Slide:<\/b> A usually dry, 15-foot slide into a deep pool. The top portion of the slide can be down climbed.<\/li>\n<li><b>R1:<\/b> Rock Pinch, canyon left, 95 foot, 2-tier rappel. If you have a big group and all arrive at the first rappel station at the same time, setting up a twin rappel is recommended. If the group does not get to Cibecue Creek by a certain time, the guide will not allow your group to go through the corridor to save time and you will have to hike around it.<\/li>\n<li><b>R2:<\/b> Rock Pinch, canyon right, 120-foot, into a waist deep pool.<\/li>\n<li><b>R3:<\/b> Rock Pinch, canyon left, 55-foot.<\/li>\n<li><b>R4:<\/b> Tree, mid-canyon, 90-foot. Before descending, be sure to hike canyon right for 200 feet to see Cibecue Creek's impressive 3rd waterfall (from the bottom).<\/li><\/ul>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>The exit is typically done by going down Cibecue Creek to the Salt River.

The purpose of the guide is for archeological protection and not as a technical canyon guide. You must have an experienced canyon leader in your group. It is also required to hire a driver to move your vehicle from the trailhead to the exit point at the Salt River. The White Mountain Apache guide can arrange this. In addition, a hiking permit is required and may be obtained online.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Beta_sites\">Beta sites<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media<\/h2><\/div>\n<ul><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http:\/\/6ixgun.com\/journal\/tank-cibecue-canyon\">Mark Kilian's Adventures<\/a> &#160;: Tank &amp; Cibecue Canyon<\/li><\/ul>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Background\">Background<\/h2><\/div>\n\n\n<\/div>","permit":"Yes","riskRating":null,"rappelCountMin":4,"quality":2.8,"vehicle":"4WD","latitude":33.8523,"longitude":-110.4709,"shuttleSeconds":null,"version":"787734663b7fcf52f9a9efee8f9be80abb269407c273cdbc8dc1a5b47f7da1eb","months":["Apr","May","Jun","Jul","Aug","Sep","Oct"],"url":"https:\/\/ropewiki.com\/Tank_Canyon","name":"Tank Canyon"}
