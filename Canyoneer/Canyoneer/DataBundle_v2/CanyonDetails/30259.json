  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>Located on the White Mountain Apache Reservation, Tank Canyon is\nusually done as an alternate entry into Cibecue Creek. The full route\nfor Cibecue Creek is surely more beautiful and interesting but may\nrequire an overnight bivy and special arrangements with the guide. On\nit's own, Tank is a worthwhile trip containing a couple down climbs, a\nslide into a pool, a swim, several nice rappels and ending in a very\nscenic view overlooking Cibecue Creek.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>A long rock hopping hike down a dry creek bed for approximately 5\nmiles with a couple easy down climbs and several still pools that can be\navoided. The approach will take approximately 2.5 to 3 hours.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Slide:</strong> A usually dry, 15-foot slide into a deep\npool. The top portion of the slide can be down climbed.</li>\n<li><strong>R1:</strong> Rock Pinch, canyon left, 95 foot, 2-tier\nrappel. If you have a big group and all arrive at the first rappel\nstation at the same time, setting up a twin rappel is recommended. If\nthe group does not get to Cibecue Creek by a certain time, the guide\nwill not allow your group to go through the corridor to save time and\nyou will have to hike around it.</li>\n<li><strong>R2:</strong> Rock Pinch, canyon right, 120-foot, into a\nwaist deep pool.</li>\n<li><strong>R3:</strong> Rock Pinch, canyon left, 55-foot.</li>\n<li><strong>R4:</strong> Tree, mid-canyon, 90-foot. Before descending,\nbe sure to hike canyon right for 200 feet to see Cibecue Creek's\nimpressive 3rd waterfall (from the bottom).</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>The exit is typically done by going down Cibecue Creek to the Salt\nRiver. This involves two additional rappels.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<p>It is required to hire a White Mountain Apache guide as an escort.\nThe purpose of the guide is for archeological protection and not as a\ntechnical canyon guide. You must have an experienced canyon leader in\nyour group. It is also required to hire a driver to move your vehicle\nfrom the trailhead to the exit point at the Salt River. The White\nMountain Apache guide can arrange this. In addition, a hiking permit is\nrequired and may be obtained online.</p>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><img src=\"rwl_en.png\" title=\"rwl_en.png\" alt=\"rwl_en.png\" /><a\nhref=\"http://6ixgun.com/journal/tank-cibecue-canyon\">Mark Kilian's\nAdventures</a> : Tank &amp; Cibecue Canyon</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n",
