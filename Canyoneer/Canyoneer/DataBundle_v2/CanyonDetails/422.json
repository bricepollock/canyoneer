is unmarked on the topographical map and was named by Chris Brennen (<a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"http:\/\/brennen.caltech.edu\/advents\/sprcld.htm\">[1]<\/a>) because of its proximity to the similarly named, smaller Cloudburst Canyon.\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>The typical descent of this canyon requires a shuttle car; see Exit for a loop option without a car at the bottom.  Begin by parking an exit vehicle at the end of the trail, located at 34.2620, -118.1176, watching for \"no parking\" signs.  Drive another vehicle to the trail head, located at 34.2545, -118.1021.  There is a small parking area and a usually-locked white metal gate.  \n<\/p><p>Instead of hiking up the asphalt road, begin the approach on a trail which begins about 50 feet before the white gate on Mt. Disappointment Road.  The approach this way is a bit quicker than the traditional route going up the asphalt road guarded by the gate.  The hike is about a mile and a half.\n<\/p><p>At the DropIn marked on the gpx points there is about a 15min hike\/\"downclimb\" before you reach R1. This DropIn had a Tree slung with webbing as an anchor. We threw 100ft of rope and rapped down to where the canyon levels out a bit and then it was about 10min more before we reached R1.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p><b>R0:<\/b>\nThere is sometimes webbing on a tree crossing the trail at the drop in point as shown in the GPS file to make a rappel of 195 '. Some groups may want the extra safety of being on rope rather than walking down the steep fine sand and earth (as quoted by C. Brennan). Chris Brennan's beta and some groups traverse down the loose earth and skip this rappel so it is listed as R0.\n<\/p><p><b>R1:<\/b> \n60 ft\nBolt anchor on the rock LDC. if using a single 120' rope, it has to be a rope of exactly 120' and deployed evenly or bend a shorter rope on the pull side. \n<\/p><p><b>R2:<\/b> \n110 ft\nR2 is immediately after R1 with two bolts RDC. This rappel can be completed with a single 200 ft rope by stopping the rappel on the ledge 8' from the bottom but it requires care to be on the ledge while belaying\/pulling the rope to avoid falling backwards. This remaining 8' has lots of grip to scuttle down or traverse sideways. Otherwise plan on two 120' ropes to rappel, belay and pull from the very bottom of the slope to a level surface.\n<\/p><p>Hike approximately 5 minutes to arrive at R3. \n<\/p><p><b>R3:<\/b> \n55 ft\nAnchor on tree RDC. It will be necessary to climb up about 10 ft to reach this anchor. This rappel has lots of loos dirt and rocks so care should be taken not to pitch rocks down on your belayer unintentionally. It is possible to down-climb RDC but most will choose to rappel.\n<\/p><p>Hike approximately 10 minutes to arrive at R4. \n<\/p><p><b>R4:<\/b> \n50 ft\nBolt anchor on a rock LDC close to the edge.\n<\/p><p>Hike a few steps to arrive at R5. \n<\/p><p><b>R5:<\/b>\n65 ft\nThe anchor is located on a short tree LDC. The 65 feet goes all the way to the bottom of the slope. Even though the bottom section of the rappel can be a downclimb, it is fine to continue the rappel all the way to a level surface with enough rope deployed. Depending on the group. This could arguably be down climbed with one tricky move on a large downward sloping bolder LDC or through the tight rabbit hole RDC to come out under the boulder.\n<\/p><p>Hike approximately 5 minutes to arrive at R6. \n<\/p><p><b>R6:<\/b> \n125 ft\nUse the anchor on the large tree in the Center of the canyon which has fallen perpendicular to the main path.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Hike approximately 30 minutes to arrive at the exit location, where at least one vehicle should be located. \n<\/p><p>There are many large dead fallen trees from the 2015-2016 winters that are clogging the beginning of the exit route down canyon. Make your way through the Byzantine corridor of unstable downed trees making sure to stay Canyon Left as much as possible until you pickup a Use trail Heading DCL marked by cairns. After passing the ruins of an old cabin the trail continues LDC on a use trail winding down to Gabrieleno Trail. DO NOT VEER LEFT OR RIGHT ON THIS TRAIL! Instead continue down hill on the use trail marked by cairns until reaching the old disused fire road (Ladybug Canyon Road).  At this point, turn right and follow the old fire road 700ft to the white forest gate at 34.260718, -118.11648 and your exit vehicle.\n<\/p><p>Watch for <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http:\/\/www.pcta.org\/2013\/poodle-dog-bush-warning-8891\/\">Poodle-dog-bush<\/a> on this section! It can cause contact dermatitis and can be transmitted in the same way that poison oak is transmitted (active for up to a year or sometimes more even when dead!).\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading3\"><h3 id=\"Loop_option\">Loop option<\/h3><\/div>\n<p>This canyon can also be done without a shuttle; at the bottom of the canyon, turn right on the first trail (Gabrieleno Trail), take it up to the road and turn right on Mount Wilson Road to walk a quarter mile back to your car. This adds 2 miles to the trip or about an hour to an hour and a half of time.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Red_tape\">Red tape<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Beta_sites\">Beta sites<\/h2><\/div>\n<ul><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http:\/\/brennen.caltech.edu\/advents\/sprcld.htm\">Chris Brennen's Adventure Hikes (St Gabriels)<\/a> &#160;: Supercloud Canyon<\/li>\n<li>[<a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external free\" href=\"http:\/\/ropewiki.com\/User:Super_Amazing_Map?id=Superclo\">http:\/\/ropewiki.com\/User:Super_Amazing_Map?id=Superclo<\/a><\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n<\/div><div class=\"mw-content-ltr mw-parser-output\" lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><p>ud_Canyon_-_California_(San_Gabriels) Super Amazing Map] &#160;: Supercloud Canyon\n<\/p>\n<ul><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/fzoh_WWiaDg\">That Adventure Life<\/a>&#160;: SuperCloud Canyon<\/li><\/ul>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media<\/h2><\/div>\n<ul><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http:\/\/candition.com\/canyons\/supercloud-canyon\">Candition.com<\/a> &#160;: SuperCloud Canyon<\/li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https:\/\/www.duffyknox.com\/Content\/n-f5S3bd\/photography\/sports\/Canyoneering\/Supercloud-canyon-June-2011\/\">Supercloud June 2011<\/a><\/li><\/ul>\n<p>Night Canyoneering:\n{{#ev:vimeo|111887060}}\n<\/p>\n<ul><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http:\/\/wikiloc.com\/wikiloc\/view.do?id=8696545\">Wikiloc.com<\/a> &#160;: Super Cloud Canyon<\/li>\n<li>Filmed 12-28-20 <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external free\" href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/fzoh_WWiaDg\">https:\/\/youtu.be\/fzoh_WWiaDg<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/fzoh_WWiaDg\">That Adventure Life<\/a>&#160;: SuperCloud Canyon<\/li><\/ul>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Background\">Background<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>First known canyoneering descent by: Mark Duttweiler &amp; Chris Brennen on February 2nd, 2000.\n<\/p>\n\n\n<\/div>","technicalRating":3,"waterRating":"A","rappelCountMin":6,"version":"f0d8223d147df281848d7ab77b50e778cd0d686ae236696c8f8d3da3ed75e753","vehicle":"Passenger","id":422}
