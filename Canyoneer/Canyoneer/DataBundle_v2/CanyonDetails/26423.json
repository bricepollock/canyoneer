In this canyon you can find some really nice but difficult rappels, delicate jumps, deep green pools, some swimming passages with a strong current. The canyon is very technical but with proper water flow it provides a lot of satisfaction and intense feelings. River Arzino is very well known for its beautiful emerald color and it is probably the most beautiful river in Friuli region. The canyon is named Arzino 0, because this river has already 4 canyons in its lower reaches, named Arzino 1,2,3 and 4 which are more suitable for whitewater kayaks. \n<\/p><p><b>Canyon is not suitable for<\/b>  \n<\/p><p><b>beginners!<\/b>  \n<\/p><p><b>Zone:<\/b>  Italy – Friuli – Val d&#39;Arzino \n<\/p><p><b>Dimensions:<\/b> Entrance: 570 m Exit: 460 m Height: 110 m Length: 900 m   \n<\/p><p><b>Period<\/b>  August - November (Avoid it after rain.) \n<\/p><p><b>Times:<\/b>  Approach: 10 min (with 1 car or 1 min with 2 cars) Progression: 1,5 - 2 h Return: 15 min (with 1 car or 5 min with 2 cars) \n<\/p><p><b>Shuttle:<\/b>  No (Shuttle is not necessary) \n<\/p><p><b>Equipment:<\/b>  Expedition (with 10mm bolts with maillons and slings) \n<\/p><p><b>Rope:<\/b>  1 x 50m \n<\/p><p><b>Highest waterfall:<\/b>  23 m \n<\/p><p><b>Possible exit<\/b>  Yes (many, on the left side) \n<\/p><p><b>Maps:<\/b>  Carta Tabacco 13 \n<\/p><p><b>Attraction:<\/b>  Regional \n<\/p><p><b>Difficulty:<\/b>  V5 a5-a6 II\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>From Tolmezzo (near Centro sportivo) take the road to Verzegnis and Chialcis, cross the bridge over Tagliamento river and drive to village Chialcis. In Chialcis take the road to Sella Chianzuran, cross the saddle and drive downhill into Val d&#39;Arzino. On your right you will see the turning (sign) for Pozzis, drive onward through 2 very sharp bends and approximately 500 meters further on you will arrive at a small parking lot on the right side. On the left side there is a very small chapel and iron cross. From the direction of Udine is better to use the road to Spilimbergo – Flagogna – Sequalins – San Francesco. \n<\/p><p><b>Checkpoint:<\/b>  The checkpoint is on the entrance of the canyon or 70 m lower from the small metal bridge, which is accessible from the large parking before the sharp road bend. \n<\/p><p><b>Do not enter the canyon, if the water flow is higher than 0.5m on the webpage:<\/b> \n<\/p><p><b>Protezione Civile.fvg.it, better is 0.4m.<\/b>\n<\/p><p>From the parking lot follow the road uphill to the first sharp bend. On the left side of this bend take the sand (dirt) road which leads to the bridge over the Arzino (20 m from the main road). Here is the entrance for the canyon.\n<\/p>\n<style data-mw-deduplicate=\"TemplateStyles:r1062633282\">@media all and (max-width:720px){.mw-parser-output .content .thumb>div:not(.thumbinner){display:flex;justify-content:center;flex-wrap:wrap;align-content:flex-start;flex-direction:column}}body.skin-vector .mw-parser-output div.thumb>div:not(.thumbinner){font-size:94%;text-align:center;overflow:hidden;min-width:100px}body.skin-minerva .mw-parser-output div.thumb>div:not(.thumbinner){margin:0 auto;max-width:100%!important}<\/style> \n<div class=\"thumb tright\">\n<div style=\"display:table;\">\n<span class=\"mw-default-size\" typeof=\"mw:Error mw:File\/Frameless\">\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p><b>C 3m:<\/b> 1 bolt with maillon (R) <b>D 1.5m:<\/b> (L) - exposed  \n<\/p><p><b>MC 1m&#160;:<\/b> 1 bolt (L) – hard to reach  \n<\/p><p><b>C 11m:<\/b> 1 bolt with maillon (L) – into the flow  \n<\/p><p><b>T 1.5m<\/b> \n<\/p><p><b>T 3m:<\/b> On the right side of the flow into the very turbulent pool (white water), it is advisable to secure the first canyoneer down with rope.  \n<\/p><p><b>C 18m:<\/b> 1 bolt with maillon (L) – Don't jump into the first pool on the right (no exit), the rappeling point (bolt) is far on the left on a small rock covered with grass (it is very difficult to find).
