{"rappelCountMax":16,"description":"<div class=\"mw-content-ltr mw-parser-output\" lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><p>West New York Canyon is (to my current knowledge) the most exciting canyon on the south side of the North Fork of the American River. After bushwhacking and boulder hopping a bit to get to the first drop, it starts out with a series of pretty continuous, enjoyable waterfalls. Downstream, a bit before the confluence, the pace picks up, with a quality narrow gorge with several beautiful, exciting falls.\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>First set your shuttle. If you have a couple of really nice off-roading rigs, you could probably set your shuttle here: 39.1978, -120.4989\n4WD and high clearance (goes in a subaru, if you're not too picky) set your shuttle here: 39.1892, -120.5014\nOtherwise you should be able to get at least to here: 39.1822, -120.5067\nNext drive back to the dirt road here: 39.1805, -120.5347. Park at the beginning and walk, or drive it out as far as half a mile to start. \n<\/p><p>Hike out (or drive) the road as it heads along the ridge. Cut off as it climbs a slight bit out of a low saddle, and aim for the ridge that cuts North East into the canyon. Follow this down until things start to look cliffy, then cut right back into the drainage that way. You should be able to scramble down with a little difficulty, but nothing sketchy, and suit up in the willows.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>The first drops starts at the confluence with another fork coming in from the left. Looks like there could be drops up that way, but nothing too thrilling. This drop is awesome, and probably your best opportunity for a good jump in the canyon. You'll likely touch bottom, but it probably goes. \n<\/p><p>A short ways downstream more fun drops continue. This should all be fairly simple. If not, you may have trouble downstream. \n<\/p><p>Eventually the canyon flattens out for a bit as you walk along. It widens out just above a large drop (~100ft), beneath which you can see the canyon narrowing into a gorge. Climb down a chute (looks like a slide, but the rock is sticky) and jump into the pool below. The next drop we (for some reason) rigged off of a tree up on the left, that has quite a bit of poison oak around it. Note that an alternative anchor would likely require bolts. This anchor does make for an awesome spot for a rappel, though bolts on the right would be easier. \n<\/p><p>The next drop is double staged, ~150 feet. Another beautiful big drop follows, and a smaller one we were able to descend by down climbing a log. \n<\/p><p>You'll hit the confluence with the east fork soon. The East Fork of New York Creek has a 600 foot waterfall. It's actually not horribly far upstream, but unless it's really early in the day, you have a ways to go. I recommend staying the course, as it may take another hour to reach the river. There is a rappel or two, and lots of scrambling to go.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Just before you get to the NF American River, a small trail exits right. Head out that trail as it traverses just above a river, and then turns to climb (very steeply at times) up out of the canyon. Poison Oak is not too bad if you pay attention.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Red_tape\">Red tape<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2
