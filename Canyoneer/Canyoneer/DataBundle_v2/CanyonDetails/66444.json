Rainier National Park just south of Iron Mountain, a shorter satellite peak of Mt. Rainier. While it's a cool chasm with 100ft high walls in places, it has a very high pay-to-play ratio with a 4-5mi hike coming and going. The chasm was dry in early September 2021, but clearly experiences good flow earlier in the season per the lack of vegetation within the canyon.  \n<\/p>\n<ul><li>The chasm is probably best visited while doing backpacking or doing something else in the neighborhood. It's a literal stones-throw away from the Devil's Dream Camp just off the Wonderland Trail.<\/li><\/ul>\n<ul><li>The Wonderland Trail is not shown properly on USGS maps. It runs up the south side of the chasm, not the north.<\/li><\/ul>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>From Longmire, hike the Wonderland Trail for 4.3mi to a bridge crossing Devils Dream Creek just downstream of the chasm. This is a checkpoint for the flow (if any). Continue hiking up the Wonderland another 0.4mi to just before the Devil's Dream trailside camp where a user trail drops down to the north into the drainage. Total distance is 4.7mi and 2500' elevation gain.\n<\/p>\n<ul><li>A more interesting approach might be to continue up the trail to about 5000ft elevation, then bushwhack east to the top of the falls. This would likely add several rappels to the adventure.<\/li><\/ul>\n<ul><li>You could also hike here via the Kautz Creek trail, although it's longer and has more elevation gain.<\/li><\/ul>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Head downstream wherever is easiest and the creek soon slots up.\n<\/p>\n<ul><li>20ft downclimb DCR.<\/li>\n<li>30ft.<\/li>\n<li>??
