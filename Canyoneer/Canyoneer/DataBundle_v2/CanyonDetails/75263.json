{"waterRating":"A","description":"<div class=\"mw-content-ltr mw-parser-output\" lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><p>Pretty much every SoCal canyoneer has walked by Henninger Canyon on their way to Eaton and never even noticed it.  But there it is, the first major drainage that crosses over the Mt Wilson Toll Road on the long uphill grind to Henninger Flats.  Well, it turns out that it does have a bunch of interesting and or spicy downclimbs and a few OK rappels.\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Use either of the Eaton parking areas, hike up the Mt Wilson Toll Road to Henninger Flats, take the road (or cross over the upper part of Coyote Canyon) to get just North of the big steel water tank on the flat ridge to the West of Henninger Flats picnic area.  Alternatively, hike the Wilson Toll Road to approx 34.190297, -118.093513 and find the yellow post and the trail next to it; climb up the \"Henninger Express\" past 4 very steep sections, traverse left ~100 feet after the 4th steep section, and then follow the trail that runs along the water pipe, directly up to the big steel water tank.  From either approach to the big steel water tank, head North, find where the road has a bulldozed path directly into the canyon, then head about 50 to 100 feet further to a very steep runnel and climb down that to the canyon floor.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>There are 6 (as I counted) main rappels, the longest being a 2 stage at 100 feet (should be broken in 2 for rope pull ease).  There are many short to somewhat taller downclimbs, which are the dominate technical features.  I left webbing anchors for the longer rappels, but I also ghosted a few of the steeper downclimbs.  Use you judgement!  The canyon floor is clear of brush, except where you get close to the sneak entrance \/ exit (34.19202, -118.09496); there is a thicket of sticker bushes; climb up DCL on an animal run, then drop back into the canyon where it clearly drops off a sizeable rappel.<br \/> \n<\/p><p>Once you reach the Mt Wilson Toll Road again you are done with the main run, but you can continue down the lower section, which has a couple more downclimbs, one 25 foot rappel, and a couple thickets of poison oak, so I cannot recommend doing the whole thing.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Red_tape\">Red tape<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Beta_sites\">Beta sites<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Background\">Background<\/h2><\/div>\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nParsed by mw‐api‐ext.codfw.main‐6779cc57fc‐7wx9k\nCached time: 20240914191902\nCache expiry: 2592000\nReduced expiry: false\nComplications: [show‐toc]\nCPU time usage: 0.005 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.005 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 21\/1000000\nPost‐expand include size: 0\/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 0\/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 2\/100\nExpensive parser function count: 0\/500\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0\/20\nUnstrip post‐expand size: 0\/5000000 bytes\nNumber of Wikibase entities loaded: 0\/400\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%    0.000      1 -total\n-->\n<\/div>","id":75263,"timeRating":"II","shuttleSeconds":null,"technicalRating":3,"riskRating":null,"version":"f5b135e94d089278278b9766d2b40c0082c3e60515eebd3d5cfaf3e70bf80cfd","months":[],"rappelCountMin":6,"rappelCountMax":6,"name":"Henninger (main fork)","url":"https:\/\/ropewiki.com\/Henninger_(main_fork)","vehicle":"Passenger","longitude":-118.0921,"quality":2.3,"geojson":null,"rappelLongestMeters":30.48,"permit":"No","latitude":34.194}
