  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>One of the first major waterfalls on the Washington side of the\nColumbia River Gorge, Cape Horn Falls plunges down a series of majestic\ncliffs.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Please see Red Tape below. This area (both trail and falls) is\nclosed for peregrine falcon nesting from Feb 1 through July 15\n(inclusive).</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Be aware: during the winter/spring when the Columbia River is\nrunning high, a packraft or other watercraft may be required for the\nexit. If the river is running too high, it's possible to exit via the\ntrail after R2.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>Park at the upper TH. This is closest to the viewpoint. Take the\ntrail and eventually turn left to the trails that goes towards the\ncreek. Find a good place to enter the creek.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>R1 - 50’ off of a small tree near the lip of the falls. Possibly\ndownclimbable.</p>\n<p>R2- 150’ from a tree DCR. It may be possible to find an anchor\nsituation DCL. Either way, it is very brushy and lots of loose rocks.\nWould be a good idea to make sure no one is below standing on the\nbridge.</p>\n<p>R3 - 230’ from a tree bunch DCL. Be sure to look at the shore to\ndetermine how your exit. We brought packrafts. If the water is low\nenough in the Columbia, then you could walk along the edge eastbound.\nYou do want to stay in the forest once you are able to avoid private\nproperty..</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>When the Columbia River is running high (winter/spring), there may\nnot be an option to exit without a packraft or other watercraft. Exiting\nthis way may be best on a calm day as the river just off Cape Horn is\nrenowned for high winds. Reportedly strong currents can also be an\nissue.</p>\n<p>If you have a pack raft, you can go upstream or downstream. The\ndownstream situation is a half mile float, cross the tracks, and a 200ft\nclimb through the blackberry bushes back to the Cape Horn Trail. If you\ngo upstream, paddle about 500ft, cross the tracks, then ascend 200ft up\ninto the forest. Make sure to stay off private land. You can hike the\ntrail back or use the paved road to get out.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Be aware that walking on the tracks is trespassing, so make your\ncrossing short &amp; sweet. Trains come barreling through here at 60mph\nwith little-to-no warning, so this is not a good place to linger. Stay\nout of the tunnel.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<p>From Feb 1 - Jul 15th, the lower trail is closed for falcon nesting\nseason. Effectively, this means the falls are closed then too.</p>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a\nhref=\"https://www.capehornconservancy.org/uploads/4/4/2/3/4423514/2017_map_no_rr_bluff.pdf\">Trail\nmap and directions</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>June 30 2017 Drone Footage</li>\n</ul>\n<p>{{#ev:youtube|VafJgl_MnwM}}</p>\n<p>Canyon Video</p>\n<p><a\nhref=\"https://youtu.be/agqk94tZb84\">https://youtu.be/agqk94tZb84</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n<p>First descended by Haruka James Clay Lipscomb, Michael Peterson,\nTristan Burnham, and Ryan Ernst.</p>\n<p>Special thanks to Luca for the drone footage and to Bryan Swan for\nhelpful beta.</p>\n",
