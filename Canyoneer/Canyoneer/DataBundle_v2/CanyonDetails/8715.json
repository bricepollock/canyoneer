Possibly downclimbable.\n<\/p><p>R2- 150’ from a tree DCR. It may be possible to find an anchor situation DCL. Either way, it is very brushy and lots of loose rocks. Would be a good idea to make sure no one is below standing on the bridge.\n<\/p><p>R3 - 230’ from a tree bunch DCL. Be sure to look at the shore to determine how your exit. We brought packrafts. If the water is low enough in the Columbia, then you could walk along the edge eastbound. You do want to stay in the forest once you are able to avoid private property..\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>When the Columbia River is running high (winter\/spring), there may not be an option to exit without a packraft or other watercraft. Exiting this way may be best on a calm day as the river just off Cape Horn is renowned for high winds. Reportedly strong currents can also be an issue.\n<\/p><p>If you have a pack raft, you can go upstream or downstream. The downstream situation is a half mile float, cross the tracks, and a 200ft climb through the blackberry bushes back to the Cape Horn Trail. If you go upstream, paddle about 500ft, cross the tracks, then ascend 200ft up into the forest.  Make sure to stay off private land. You can hike the trail back or use the paved road to get out. \n<\/p>\n<ul><li>Be aware that walking on the tracks is trespassing, so make your crossing short &amp; sweet. Trains come barreling through here at 60mph with little-to-no warning, so this is not a good place to linger. Stay out of the tunnel.<\/li><\/ul>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Red_tape\">Red tape<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>From Feb 1 - Jul 15th, the lower trail is closed for falcon nesting season.
