Choosing the correct line down to the canyon floor is critical since most of the walls flare out in bombay like fashion at the bottom. Stemming down in the wrong place can lead to a bombay where you may fall to the floor. The best idea is to provide a meat anchor for someone who can rappel down about 35 feet to the floor then identify the best route down and guide others from below. There are likely a few spots you can stem down here but the route we found down is on the down canyon side of some white calcium deposits on the RDC wall that look like climbers chalk which make a good landmark for finding the route. Even if you think you have found a good spot to downclimb it is still a good idea to put the first person on rope. After downclimbing to the floor you can see you have been stemming over a subway / bombay section for a while. With headlamps it may be interesting to go up this section and see how far it goes under the route you just came down. Continue down canyon scrambling along the floor through the subway section for about 100 feet to a couple of downclimbs. (Data by bluugnome.com)",

A short distance down canyon is a skinny spot you will need to climb up about 12 feet to get over it. Just past the skinny part you climbed over is a silo that taller people will have an easy time getting over while shorter people will need some assistance to be pulled around a nose to avoid going in the pothole. Continuing down canyon will be a few silos to easily cross over as you galumph and dance your way down toward the final rappel. (Data by bluugnome.com)",

Note that the arch is fragile and may not be around for a long time. Another option is to farm a rock or drift wood from below to set a choke stone anchor about 20 feet up canyon of rap 1. A JellyFish may also be a good fix for this issue. Note: if the lake were to stay low for a long time this mud could get washed out of here making the rappel longer. If the lake is high you will have water to rap or jump to. At full pool mark the last rap is actually under water. (Data by bluugnome.com)",
