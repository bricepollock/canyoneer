  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>Water Pockets Canyon is a remote, unique and interesting canyoneering\nroute that is tribitary to the Paria River in northern Arizona with many\nminor keeper potholes and sections of sculpted, deep sandstone narrows.\nIntermediate to advanced understanding of construction and evaluation of\nnatural anchors is required to safely complete this canyon. Very small\nchockstone and deadman anchors were needed to complete the descent, and\nsince they were placed directly in the watercourse it is assumed that\nsome of the anchors will eventually be washed away in flash flooding. It\nis a good idea to scout ahead and make sure you find an anchor present\nor enough good material to build a new one before committing the last of\nyour party through the previous rappel in case you find that anchor\nmaterial is lacking at a drop that must be rappelled - in which case you\nmay want to move material forward from before the previous drop for new\nanchor construction. Sand trap anchors would prove useful in one or two\nspots if this is the case (though they aren’t necessary) - water trap\nanchors would not. Though it may be prudent to bring a bolt kit to\nensure the safety of your group through this canyon, keep in mind that\nbolting is illegal in Glen Canyon National Recreational area and must be\ndone only in a life-or-death situation when all other options are\ncompletely exhausted. No bolts were used in the first descent through\ntrip.</p>\n<p>Water is usually available in the potholes of Water Pockets Canyon,\nbut many of the pools are littered with dead animals, making them less\nthan desirable for filtering. The water in Paria Canyon also seems to be\nrarely suitable to filter as it is typically quite silty and muddy. The\nbest approach seems to be to carry enough water with you for the entire\ntrip from the beginning.</p>\n<p>The easiest way to complete the canyon is to leave a shuttle vehicle\nat Lees Ferry at the confluence of the Paria and Colorado Rivers and to\napproach the canyon from the Paria Canyon overlook located south of Big\nWater, Utah.</p>\n<p>Car spot: from Phoenix, drive north on I17, east on I40 to then drive\nnorth on SR89 towards Page, AZ. Turn left onto SR89A to cross over\nNavajo Bridge and the Colorado River, shortly afterwards turning right\nfollowing signs for Lees Ferry. After 5.5 miles park at the 14 day\nextended parking area on the left to park a shuttle vehicle.</p>\n<p>Trailhead: From the Lees Ferry extended parking area, drive back the\n5.5 miles on Lees Ferry Road to turn left onto SR89A, then turn left\nonto SR89 after 14.3 miles towards Page, AZ. After driving through Page,\nAZ, then eventually Big Water, UT, turn left onto Cottonwood Canyon Road\n(unsigned to the south, though you may notice a sign for north\nCottonwood Canyon Road on the right) between mile markers 17 and 18.\nTotal mileage from the Lees Ferry car spot to Cottonwood Canyon Road is\nabout 70.4 miles. South Cottonwood Canyon Road is a fairly well-graded\ngravel road, but is a bit sandy, rocky and slow in a few sections the\nfarther you go. Stay straight at any road junctions you pass as you go,\nto eventually turn left after about 16.3 miles. After another 1.7 miles\n(18 miles overall) you will reach a parking area/nice campsite at a\nbeautiful overlook of the Paria River. This is the trailhead for the\ncanyon - park here.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>From the trailhead, hike north back on the road you drove in on for\nroughly half a mile to reach a small pull out by a small tree on the\nright to begin the descent into the canyon. Pick your way down the\nsteep, rocky slope, heading north where you reach cliff bands to find a\nmore easy way past the cliffs to eventually drop into a sandy wash\nbelow. Follow the wash east and into the main branch of the canyon and\nturn right to head down canyon. A short drop of 10 feet is easily\nbypassed on the right, to re-enter the canyon shortly afterward as you\nreach a slickrock slide to hike down. At the bottom of the slide there\nis an interesting petroglyph on the left. A short hike down canyon\nthrough the sand will bring you to the first rappel.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>The anchor for the first drop is located high on canyon left from a\nsmall arch and is about 60 feet down to a shallow pool (ankle deep). A\nfew dry, easy, shallow potholes lead to a downclimb of about 10 feet\nwhere you may wish to lower packs to make the downclimb easier. The\ndownclimb drops you into another easy, normally dry pothole about four\nfeet deep. A few more short drops afterward can be downclimbed/slid with\ncare, again lowering packs will help make the descent through some of\nthese obstacles more easy, though some may wish for a body belay or\ncapture to negotiate the drops safely. Another 15 foot, steeper\ndownclimb into a crack and some sandy hiking will bring you to two\nrelatively deep twin keeper potholes, one right after the other. The\npotholes are about six feet deep each, seem to usually be about half\nfull of water and can be defeated easily by boosting, then pulling the\nlast out. After the twin potholes are two more steep downclimbs of about\n15 feet each where again it is helpful to lower packs (for the first\ndownclimb, anyway) and again, some may wish for a rope to assist with\nthe climb.</p>\n<p>More sandy hiking will bring you to another short,scenic section of\npotholes that can either be descended or bypassed easily on the left - I\nexpect most groups will skip this section since it is short and so\neasily bypassed. If choosing to descend this section, you can rig an\nanchor from a small tree on the left to rappel about 20 feet into a\nknee-deep pool, then climb through a pothole to drop into another pool,\nthen out and into another pothole, then another before this section\nopens up. It may be most efficient to send one member of your party to\nhike around this section to assist with the exit of this last keeper\npothole. After turning a corner, the canyon descends into a nice section\nof scenic narrows that begins with a rappel of 20 feet from a chockstone\nanchor. A few fun downclimbs will bring you to a short downclimb/rappel\nthrough a tight crack of about 15 feet into a keeper pothole (usually\nabout chest-deep) that can normally be boosted out of or use a hook hole\nin the wall to aid your escape. After this obstacle is another short\ndrop of 10 feet into a shallow pool with an easy pothole escape - body\nbelay the first, then capture the last of the group, or lower your pack\nand use a few small features on the right to climb your way down.</p>\n<p>The canyon opens after this section to a sandy hike before reaching\nthe next section of narrows. After turning a corner, you will find\nyourself in a long, straight hallway almost 800 feet long. The hallway\nbegins with two downclimbs, the first being a vertical elevator\ndownclimb of about 15 feet, the second is an easier stair-step downclimb\nof about 25 feet. After the long hallway the canyon twists and begins to\ndrop more steeply into a deep and dark section of tight narrows. The\nfirst rappel in this section is about 50 feet, followed by a 30 foot\ndownclimb under a log through a somewhat tight, but easy, angled crack.\nThe easiest way to pass this section is to have one member of your party\nlower packs from on top of the far side of the log since getting under\nand past the log would be too tight to keep your pack on. Climb out of\nthe dry pothole at the bottom of the drop to reach the next rappel of\nabout 40 feet into a deep pool that may require a very short swim to\nreach a moderately easy escape on the other side. The anchor for this\nrappel is a small chockstone in the crack at your feet, you may want to\nhang your pack to make downward progress through this tight crack rappel\neasier.</p>\n<p>After the pool is another tight, grinding rappel of about 30 feet\nfrom another small chockstone a short ways down in the slot. The next\nrappel is found almost immediately afterward and is anchored from a\nsmall, somewhat marginal chockstone anchor in the crack at your feet -\nthis is one of those drops to be sure you have a good anchor before your\nentire party reaches the drop in case you wish to “farm” anchor material\nfrom farther up canyon. The rappel is about 60 feet and drops you into a\nscenic, sandy alcove. A short rappel of 15 feet from a good deadman\nanchor brings you to a fun, thoughtful downclimb of about 10 feet\nbetween two stone shelves before reaching the next rappel. The anchor\nfor the next drop is two small cobbles wedged firmly in a crack on the\nright; the rappel is about 30 feet. A short sandy hallway brings you to\nthe last drop in this section of narrows which is about 40 feet from a\nsmall deadman anchor above the drop. Very carefully inspect and test\nthis anchor before committing your party to using it.</p>\n<p>After this drop the canyon begins to open and another short hike will\nbring you to the edge of a tall cliff band that stands before you and\nthe Paria River below. The rappel through this cliffband is about 300\nfeet, mostly free-hanging and anchored from a tree about 15 feet back\nfrom the edge of the drop. A short walk around on the right gives a good\nvantage point to make sure the rope is on the ground, though use caution\nwhile traveling on the fractured cliff-top. Carefully evaluate this\nanchor - to ease rope retrieval the anchor should extend just over the\n90 degree edge of the drop. It would be wise to protect any wear points\nfor the webbing used for the anchor in any way you can - we placed a\npotshot bag under the webbing where it was rubbing on the edge. Since\nsome abrading of the webbing is inevitable here, it may be wise to back\nup this anchor with a second strand of webbing in case the first becomes\ncompromised. The tree used for the anchor seemed solid enough at its\nroots, but was unstable above that. You may want to back up this anchor\nfrom another, more solid tree 20 feet behind it for all in your party\nbut the last.</p>\n<p>After pulling the rope, head down the boulder field below by\nscrambling and downclimbing as you go to reach the Paria River.</p>\n<p><strong>R1:</strong> 60' LDC small arch.</p>\n<p><strong>R2:</strong> 40' chock stone.</p>\n<p>Hallway.</p>\n<p><strong>R3:</strong> 60' chock stone, tight start.</p>\n<p>30' downclimb into pothole.</p>\n<p><strong>R4:</strong> 60' chock stone, tight start.</p>\n<p><strong>R5:</strong> 40' chock stone, tight start. Possible\ndownclimb, last 10 feet very challenging.</p>\n<p><strong>R6:</strong> 50' rock chock.</p>\n<p>Opens up.</p>\n<p><strong>R7:</strong> 30' up and LDC off boulder.</p>\n<p><strong>R8:</strong> 50' chock stone.</p>\n<p><strong>R9:</strong> 40' chock stone RDC.</p>\n<p><strong>R10:</strong> 305' tree back. Adjust rope with each rap.\nSharp edge. Rope protection highly recommend.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>Once you reach the Paria River, turn left to begin the nine mile hike\nback to Lees Ferry and your shuttle vehicle. The steep enbankment on the\nopposite side of the river can be scrambled up a short ways down river\n(left) to reach the trail above. Turn left and follow the trail as it\nmeanders above and through the river. Decent campsites can be found\nshortly past the scramble up to the trail at river level, or about 1.5\nmiles down river on the right at a sandy clearing next to the river at a\nspot with nice, rocky shelves to lay out your gear to dry. Additional\ncampsites can be found farther down river along the trail, but are a bit\nscarce - if you find a good spot and feel like you are done for the day\n- take it. You may lose the trail occasionally, but if you do, just\nfollow the river and you will surely pick up the trail in time as it\nbecomes more defined (and is marked with small rock cairns) the closer\nyou get to the trailhead. After passing Lonely Dell Ranch, follow the\nobvious road on the right, passing through a gate, then cross over a\nbridge that spans the river and turn left to reach the parking lot where\nyou left your shuttle vehicle.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<p>A permit is required from the Paria Canyon/Vermillion Cliffs\nWilderness chapter of the Bureau of Land Management to complete this\ncanyon. Day use permits are $6/day and there are no limits to number\ngiven. Overnight permits become available to book three months in\nadvance (book as close to the 12PM opening on the 1st of the month three\nmonths in advance as you can to ensure you get as many permits as you\nneed), and cost $5 per day in addition to the day use fee. Group size is\nlimited to 10 people. The trailhead you will be using is the Paria\nCanyon overlook, though it is not currently listed as one of the\noptions. Though the trailhead is not listed as one of the options for\nhiking in the area, I have been assured from officials at the BLM that\nentry to Paria Canyon through Water Pockets Canyon is legal as long as\nnormal BLM wilderness rules and regulations are followed. Stay on\ndesignated roads in the area; no permanent anchors (bolts) are allowed;\npack it in, pack it out - you know the drill. Permits are available at:\n<a\nhref=\"https://www.blm.gov/programs/recreation/permits-and-passes/lotteries-and-permit-systems/arizona/paria-canyon\">https://www.blm.gov/programs/recreation/permits-and-passes/lotteries-and-permit-systems/arizona/paria-canyon</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a\nhref=\"https://www.facebook.com/pat.winstanley.7/media_set?set=a.1121502004575162.1073742087.100001461198708&amp;type=3\">https://www.facebook.com/pat.winstanley.7/media_set?set=a.1121502004575162.1073742087.100001461198708&amp;type=3</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n<p>After a few initial exploratory trips to the canyon, I estimated that\nthe full descent might only take 5-6 hours since the early canyon is so\nmellow with only a small handfull of short drops and obstacles. The\nfirst full descent in fact ended up taking our group of four 10 hours to\ncomplete to the Paria River after being significantly slowed by the\nlast, most technical section where it took us 5 hours (including time\nfor anchor construction, future groups may move through this section\nmore quickly) to descend only a few hundred feet through the canyon\nthrough the six tricky rappels in the last unexpectedly deep and\ntechnical section of narrows. Luckily we had just enough rope to\nnegotiate the final rappel (by about 5 feet) and managed to complete the\ndescent to the river about an hour before dark.</p>\n",
