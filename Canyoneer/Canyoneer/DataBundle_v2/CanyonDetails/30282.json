The route climbs an extremely beautiful eroded butte up dihedrals and ramps and across a ledge system with exposed drops on all sides. When the top of the butte is achieved, the traverse across is a labyrinth of obstacles that will test your route finding abilities. The tiny clues of 3 parallel scratches and brown reflective disks that are screwed into the rock will only be discovered after you've found the correct passageway, but they will help guide you through the maze of drainages, slots, and cliffs by confirming you are on the right path. For the right group of canyoneers this will be an extremely enjoyable puzzle; for the unprepared it could be mean an unexpected camping trip or worse.\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Head towards Island in the Sky from the North (campground) end.
