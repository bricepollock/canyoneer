We felt that Canyon Sem Alma actually had much soul and that the lesser quality of this neighboring canyon was therefore disappointing - hence Sem Decepção (without disappointment). Admittedly, we descended under the intensity of the afternoon heat after several hours of hiking in and around Turkey Creek.
