  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>Like Canyon Sem Alma, but worse.</p>\n<p>There are scenic, narrow sections of canyon with some challenging\ndownclimbs - however these narrows are never sustained.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>We initially stuck to a ridge to avoid the brushy upper sections and\nthen descended into the north fork of the canyon. The south fork\nappeared less interesting.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>One optional 30' rappel in the north fork, several challenging\ndownclimbs to 15' (which some may opt to rappel), and one 20' rappel\njust prior to the confluence with Sem Alma.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>After the confluence with Sem Alma, continue to Turkey Creek and then\nturn left (up canyon) and locate the residual trail / road which leads\nup the ridge and back to your vehicle (same exit as Sem Alma).</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<p>This canyon is located on State Trust Land which is open to\nrecreation but requires a permit. The permit can purchased here: <a\nhref=\"https://asld.secure.force.com/recreationalpermit/\">https://asld.secure.force.com/recreationalpermit/</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n<p>Explored by Todd Martin and Nick Clegg on 5/20/2023.</p>\n<p>Sem Alma in Portuguese means \"without soul\". We felt that Canyon Sem\nAlma actually had much soul and that the lesser quality of this\nneighboring canyon was therefore disappointing - hence Sem Decepção\n(without disappointment). Admittedly, we descended under the intensity\nof the afternoon heat after several hours of hiking in and around Turkey\nCreek. Perhaps under more ideal conditions others may find this canyon\nworthwhile.</p>\n",
