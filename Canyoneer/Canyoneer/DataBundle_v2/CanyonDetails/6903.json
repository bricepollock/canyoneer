CANYON HAD VERY NICE PETROGYTHS AT THE TOP. ALSO, FOUND A DEAD RADIO COLLARED COUGAR AT THE BASE OF THE BIG DROP, AND RETURNED IT TO THE PEOPLE TACKING IT - THEY WERE VERY PLEASED TO SEE WHAT HAPPENED TO IT. VERY NICE SHORT CANYON, BUT WORTHY OF SEEING IT\n<\/p><p>Here is an email response from the scientist we returned the mountain lion's radio collar to (written May 2012):\n<\/p>\n<ul><li>That is incredible that you found the lion and collar!  I didn't think we would ever see it again. I am curious to see where you guys found it in relation to where we looked back in September [2011].  As far as our study goes, we are trying to learn all we can about mountain lions on the Nevada National Security Site (NNSS) with primary focus on home range, movement patterns, diet, and potential risk to site workers.  We learned a lot from this cat.  It was a healthy, 5-6 year old male caught on the west side of NNSS (Timber Mountain).  Within a week he was on the west side of Death Valley and spent most of his time in the Cottonwood and Grapevine Mountains.  He went as far as Gold Mountain and returned to NNSS for two weeks in July.  Then he went back to Death Valley.  I am attaching a map of his movements.  He was captured on April 19, 2011 and we estimate he died late August to early September.  Estimated home range is about 1,484 square miles which may be the largest documented home range of a mountain lion. I look forward to seeing the pictures and appreciate your description of the site.  After hiking to the bottom of Dry Bone Canyon I can see how easy it would be for a lion to fall, especially since they move through these habitats at night a lot of the time. I will let you know about visiting the site after I look at the pictures.  Thanks again for retrieving the collar and getting the information to Linda and myself!!!!!<\/li><\/ul>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>4x4 high clearance vehicle needed.\n<\/p><p>Approach is from White Top Mountain Road.

We found it in May 2012. It had a radio collar, which I turned in to DVNP biologist, who returned it to the researcher who had collared it on the Nevada Test Site. The lion died in autumn 2011. \n<\/p><p>R5 (120 feet) two-stage rappel anchored from a single piton RDC.\n<\/p><p>R6 (20 feet) anchored from single knot chock on LDC. A small cairn anchor could be built with available material. Rappel over a chockstone.\n<\/p><p>R7 (20 feet).

Hike up LDC. From the bottom, start out on the left of the drainage as you look up. Then cut back into the drainage following cairns above dry falls. \n<\/p><p>Eventually you need to leave the drainage and pop out over the ridge on the left. \n<\/p><p>Once you get to the ridge, the GPS track shows you contouring around drainages. We did that for a while, and wished we didn't. Recommend just going back down to the wash and then hiking up that to your vehicle.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Red_tape\">Red tape<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Beta_sites\">Beta sites<\/h2><\/div>\n<ul><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http:\/\/ropewiki.com\/User:Super_Amazing_Map?id=Upper_Drybone_Canyon_-_California_(Death_Valley)\">Super Amazing Map<\/a> &#160;: Upper Drybone Canyon<\/li><\/ul>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>FIRST DOCUMENTED DESCENT:\n<\/p>\n<ul><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external free\" href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/scott.swaney\/media_set?set=a.10150938209047930.486617.668617929&amp;type=3\">https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/scott.swaney\/media_set?set=a.10150938209047930.486617.668617929&amp;type=3<\/a><\/li><\/ul>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Background\">Background<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Originally explored by <a href=\"\/w\/index.php?title=User:Scott_Swaney&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"User:Scott Swaney (page does not exist)\">Scott Swaney<\/a> on 05-05-12 .
