  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>Essentially just a skills practice area, not worth doing for a\ncanyoning experience.</p>\n<p>The whole trip is an out and back, you can scramble around all the\nabseils on the way up, then practice setting anchors on the way\ndown.</p>\n<p>The main waterfall and swimming hole is often used for general\nmembers of the public to swim in and cliff jump. Consider scrambling\nback up and disassembling your anchors, even on the side creek to not\ntempt unskilled public to use them in unsafe ways...</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>Park at the intersection of Cranky Corner SOUTH Road at the\nintersection with Bimbadeen Road where it goes up the steep hill. It is\npossible to continue straight to the ford, however there is no good\nplace to turn around at the end.</p>\n<p>Continue walking straight along the firetrail which continues in the\ndirection of Cranky Corner South Road until you reach a ford and\nwaterfall a few metres downstream. This is referred to as \"Main\nWaterfall\".</p>\n<p>Main Waterfall can be walked around on river left a few metres back\nup the fire trail.</p>\n<p>Continue down the main creek, past a small pool and 1m drop until\nanother creek enters from river right with a trickling waterfall of\napproximately 7 metres. This side creek is the \"worthwhile\" section with\nmultiple abseils which can be walked around.</p>\n<p>Abseils listed in order that you descend them.</p>\n<p>Abseil three (first you see when heading up the side creek) can be\nscrambled up on river left.</p>\n<p>Abseil two can be scrambled up through the boulder garden river\nleft.</p>\n<p>Abseil one can be scrambled up on river left.</p>\n<p>Above abseil one the creek flattens out and can be explored as much\nor as little as you feel</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>Main waterfall anchor can be set river right from tree above boulder,\na few metres back from the edge. Note track here is getting eroded.</p>\n<p>Abseil one from large tree on the boulder, river left. Can continue\ndown the slab. Approx 3m for tree boulder and approx another 8m for the\nslab</p>\n<p>Abseil two from large tree river right down vertical face, approx\n5m</p>\n<p>Abseil three river left (dry) or river centre (wet), approx 7m</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>Return the way you came in</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<p>Bogans...</p>\n<p>There is a set of VERY dodgy hardware store bolts with a sharp metal\nplate above main waterfall on river left. Often accompanied by a\nhardware store rope as a handline</p>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n",
