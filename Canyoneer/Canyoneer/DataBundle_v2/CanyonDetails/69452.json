  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>The upper part of the Río Barahuco is a limestone slot of crystalline\nwater. It has been partially explored by some of the five or so\ncanyoneers that live in the Dominican Republic. This has the potential\nto be the best known route in the DR.</p>\n<p>The beta currently on this page was written from a bottom-up\nexploration to the bottom of the crux rappel, and then a conversation\nwith Nicolas Bera, a Dominican canyoneer and one of only three people to\nhave completed the route. For scouting to establish the full top-down\nroute, satellite view shows a road just to the south of the drainage,\nrunning very close along the ridge. It would be a good place to scout\nfrom and/or fly a drone to see where to drop in. However, to start the\ncanyon from this side would make for a long car shuttle, so the final\napproach route will likely start in the community to the north, and from\nthere be less than a mile downhill to the canyon bottom.</p>\n<p>You'll want a shorty wetsuit or more. Also, be careful of giant\ncentipedes - these mountains seem to have more giant centipedes than\nanywhere in the DR, and indeed more than most tropical places, so keep\nyour eyes open at all times - their bite is not dangerous but is\nextremely painful!</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>This approach is speculated. You'll want to drive up the steep dirt\nroad trending northwest from the trail to Balneario La Plaza. Somewhere\nup here, north of the actually canyon, will be a place to park, and then\na mostly downhill approach through mostly farms to reach the canyon.</p>\n<p>If you are an exploration-ready team (bolt kit, 4x4 cars, GPS,\nmachete, Spanish-fluency), talk to locals about where you can camp, and\nwhere the trail is. Apparently there IS a trail that farmers use. It's\nnot on any map - yet.</p>\n<p>You'll need two 4x4 vehicles with high clearance (would recommend\nbeefy Jeep wranglers) for the shuttle. The gravel on the road is\nslippery and rental high clearance vehicles in 2023 spun wheels trying\nto go up (in fact one got a flat tire), so we returned to Estancia Don\nArmando (the parking area for <a href=\"Cañon_de_la_Virgen\"\ntitle=\"wikilink\"><strong>Cañon de la Virgen</strong></a>), left our two\nvehicles there, and walked back. The road is not immediately visible on\nsatellite maps, but it does exist, and had upgrades in 2022-2023. The\nauthor of this page has NOT driven if, so the shuttle route on the GPS\ntrack is estimated. But, it absolutely does exist.</p>\n<p>You NEED to get help from a local guy who knows the area, and has\ndown the canyon himself. Please call/text Jorgito Mendez (829) 691-9796,\nor just ask the local people where to find him. Jorgito is your best\n(and only?) bet for finding out the approach details.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>From the estimated start point on this page, the canyon slowly slots\nup, with multiple rappels. In the beginning, flow is likely low, with no\nwater hazards.</p>\n<p>Nicolas says the route may need bolts replaced, as the bolts (and\nnatural anchors) they used may corrode unpredictably in the mineral-rich\nwater. Go prepared with a bolt kit and lots of webbing/rapides.</p>\n<p>The biggest rappel in this upper part is probably 50m, down a\ntrickling, sloping waterfall.</p>\n<p>The canyon reaches its crux waterfall is almost total blackness\n(headlight mandatory) after passing multiple seeps in the walls where\nthe flow pick up. Even in the height of the dry season, this waterfall\nis a thundering obstacle with no easy way down.</p>\n<p>The author here only upclimbed to the base of the waterfall, but it\nappears around 20m in height, shooting off a narrow slot at an angle,\nand into a pitch-black pool with potential hydraulic hazards. Nicolas\ncould not remember the specific details of how his first descent team\npassed this waterfall, but didn't remember it being as bad as it sounds.\nRegardless, be prepared to place multiple bolts to rappel out and\npossibly redirect away from the torrent. For this reason, the canyon's\nestimated rating is 'R' for hazard.</p>\n<p>After the cruz waterfall, the flow actually drops slightly, as flow\nis lost into underground seeps. The canyon climaxes in beauty for an\nhour, continuing in darkness before emerging into sunlight. The jumps,\nslides and downclimbs in this section are the best of the best in the\nworld. In a lifetime of canyoneering, in dozens of seasons of slots,\nthis hallway will likely be one of the highlights of your life.</p>\n<p>The slot gets slightly wider, enough that it is bright and sunny at\nnoon. There is also green moss on the walls. The beauty is surreal.</p>\n<p>There's one rappel here, in sunlight, with a set of bolts on the\nleft. These bolts were placed by Hereward Cooper in January 2023, and,\nagain, the mineral content may act unpredictably on them in the years to\ncome. Be cautious.</p>\n<p>All too soon, the slot brings you to an intersection where the canyon\ngoes left and opens greatly. It's more a stream than a slot 15 minutes\nlater when you reach the graffiti and trash-strewn Balneario La Plaza.\nNow time to exit.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>The exit is a trail from Balneario La Plaza back to your shuttle car.\nThis trail is easy to follow, and crosses the stream many times. It's\nnever more than a few meters from the stream, until the end, where it\ngoes uphill on stream-left for a few minutes to get back to your shuttle\ncar.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<p>You are free to enter these mountains without a guide. Locals may\ntell you otherwise, but in general are very friendly and happy to see\nyou coming. When you park at one of the houses, be sure you give a few\nhundred pesos to a family to watch your vehicle. Parking away from a\nhouse gives an opportunity for a break-in, which has happened\nbefore.</p>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<p><a\nhref=\"https://www.lukaseddy.com/canyons-of-the-dominican-republic\">https://www.lukaseddy.com/canyons-of-the-dominican-republic</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n<p>This route was probably first descended by Nicolas Bera and team in\n2021 or so. They descended it once, spending something likely 18 hours\non the route due to having to bolt. They took down a local 60-year old\nman, who had never canyoneered before, and he apparently did fine.</p>\n<p>They went through the second half of the canyon in total blackness.\nNicolas states he remembers the route being good, but couldn't remember\nmany specifics.</p>\n<p>A group of American canyoneers (Michelle Niles, Hereward Cooper, Dan\nKinler, Sarah Jorgenson, Lukas Eddy and Suhei Eddy) returned in January\n2023 with almost no beta, and explored from the bottom up. They were\nunable to complete the route from the top down, as the exact drop-in\npoint remains unmapped, and could require a fair bit of wandering\naround.</p>\n<p>The next group needs a 4x4 vehicle, and a few days to park up at the\ntop and look for the best approach route and drop-in point, and then to\nput it on the map.</p>\n",
