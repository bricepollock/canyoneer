  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>Something of a seasonal creek located just outside Northwoods, WA.\nThe creek has a bit of a hike in &amp; out, but is likely a good one for\nbeginners with competent leadership. The flow seems to become low and\nbeginner-friendly in May. More experienced folks might like to hit it in\nhigher water conditions. Creek is probably not worth visiting in late\nsummer.</p>\n<p>Area seems to be visited by hunters, so wearing bright colors on the\nhike in may be a good idea.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Watershed: 1.15mi^2.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"directions\">Directions</h2>\n<p>From the small community of Northwoods, WA, locate the Eagle Cliff\nstore &amp; campground. Across the street take the No 10 Rd (not signed)\ndownwards for 0.4mi to a gate and turnaround. Park here, but don't block\nthe gate. The flow here may or may not be a great representation of\nwhat's going on higher up on the creek as it seems to go underground\nnear the bottom. This is the same trailhead for Able Creek.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>Follow the road upward through a giant clear cut (\"leave no tree\nbehind!\"). Map and GPS useful here as there's a few side-turns and it's\neasy to walk off down the wrong spur. On entering the woods at the top\nof the clear cut, reach a junction and go left. Go left at the next\njunction. This road quickly becomes overgrown, but push on through and\npersist until you reach the end of the grade. From here, make your way\ndown-slope to the east wherever is easiest. You will reach a small\nstream first. Follow this tributary downstream until it intersects the\nmain creek just below a small boulder garden. This is a good place to\nsuit up.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>From the drop-in, just follow the creek downstream back to the car.\nNorthwoods Creek is somewhat unique for the amazing amount of bedrock\nwhich has been completely swept clean of rocks and other obstacles.\nVirtually from the drop-in all the way to the top of R6 is one\ncontinuous swath of bedrock. Makes for some very mellow, pleasant creek\nwalking.</p>\n<p>Most of the drops on Northwoods Creek are low angle... we've tried to\nguestimate the vertical height, but sometimes more rope will be required\nfor the rappel given the horizontal distance involved. Be aware when\nrigging.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>10ft ramp. Downclimb DCL.</li>\n<li>R1: 10ft. Possible dirty downclimb DCL.</li>\n<li>R2: 50ft low-angle drop to a platform. R3 comes immediately.</li>\n<li>R3: 30ft low-angle drop. A deviation in the DCL wall would be nice\nto allow rappellers to stay in the flow (i.e. use R2 anchor for both\ndrops).</li>\n<li>R4: 12ft step.</li>\n<li>R5: 35ft photogenic ramp-falls.</li>\n<li>R6: <em>Northwoods Falls.</em> The world suddenly drops away\nunderneath you. 200ft+ depending on where you rappel from. We anchored\non tree DCL and rappelled a nice line down the DCR side of the falls.\nCan land on a platform 150ft below, or run the rope out a full 200ft\nrope (single strand) to the very bottom. Stay on the DCR side of the\nfalls or you risk a pendulum. One can downclimb from the platform, but\nit's pretty slippery. Use caution. The next two rappels come in rapid\nsuccession.</li>\n<li>R7: 55ft. Anchored on a tree far DCL.</li>\n<li>R8: 40ft.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Not far below R8, reach a dumped bullet-marked sports car in the\nmiddle of the drainage.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>Continue down the drainage for 0.25mi to the bridge where you parked.\nIn 2019, there were lots of downed trees in the drainage, just make your\nway through wherever is easiest. Sometimes it's easier to make your way\nout of the drainage to one side or the other to make forward progress.\nIn low flow the creek may vanish into the rocks leaving a dry channel\nuntil you pick up a tributary entering DCR just before the bridge.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<p>Free non-hunting recreational permit from <a\nhref=\"https://www.rayonierhunting.com/\">Rayonier Hunting &amp;\nRecreation</a> is required. \"Pope Swift South Non-Hunting Individual\" is\nwhat you need.</p>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pLPMPkxGAk\">Video from\nJanuary 2018.</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n",
