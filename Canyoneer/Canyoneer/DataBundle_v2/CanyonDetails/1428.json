{"description":"<div class=\"mw-content-ltr mw-parser-output\" lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><p><br \/>\nA short canyon between Josephine Creek and Classic, dropping into Big Tujunga. It uses the same exit trail as Josephine and Great Falls of the Fox\n<\/p>\n<ul><li><ul><li>As with all the Big T canyons your help is needed to keep access open. This entire area is still seeing a slow recovery from the old station fire which means lots of invasive plants and overgrowth in general can quickly close off access to these areas and\/or make your time in them miserable. Consider adding a pair of hand shears and\/or small bypass loppers to your gear list when descending these places.<\/li><\/ul><\/li><\/ul>\n<pre><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http:\/\/aggie-horticulture.tamu.edu\/earthkind\/landscape\/proper-pruning-techniques\/\">Educate yourself on how and why<\/a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"http:\/\/ep.yimg.com\/ay\/yhst-136001134851880\/forester-8-1-4-by-pass-pro-forged-pruner-pr7240-3.jpg\">[1]<\/a>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https:\/\/www.nationalforests.org\/who-we-are\/our-impact\/angeles\">BIG TUJUNGA CANYON RESTORATION<\/a>\n<\/pre>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Head through the locked gate and follow the fire road a short ways down to the head of the canyon at ___________\n<\/p><p>There is a corrugated metal drainage heading into the canyon on your left.

There is a trail going up the next big ridge (LDC). This is the same trail used for Josephine, Great Falls of the Fox, White Oak etc. The first part of the trail is really just a scramble up the side of a steep slope but it soon develops into a real trail, although it is not maintained.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Red_tape\">Red tape<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Beta_sites\">Beta sites<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Background\">Background<\/h2><\/div>\n\n\n<\/div>","geojson":null,"rappelLongestMeters":36.58,"technicalRating":3,"rappelCountMin":4,"longitude":-118.1676,"timeRating":"II","shuttleSeconds":300,"id":1428,"url":"https:\/\/ropewiki.com\/Kafer_Canyon","permit":"No","vehicle":null,"latitude":34.2977,"version":"9e6702358d00fb811ea646eb4e375f7ecd60f2d523c93d0e4c00f02794c31a6f","waterRating":"A","months":[],"rappelCountMax":5,"quality":3,"name":"Kafer Canyon","riskRating":null}
