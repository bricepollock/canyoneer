  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>A short canyon between Josephine Creek and Classic, dropping into Big\nTujunga. It uses the same exit trail as Josephine and Great Falls of the\nFox</p>\n<ul>\n<li><ul>\n<li>As with all the Big T canyons your help is needed to keep access\nopen. This entire area is still seeing a slow recovery from the old\nstation fire which means lots of invasive plants and overgrowth in\ngeneral can quickly close off access to these areas and/or make your\ntime in them miserable. Consider adding a pair of hand shears and/or\nsmall bypass loppers to your gear list when descending these\nplaces.</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul>\n<p><a\nhref=\"http://aggie-horticulture.tamu.edu/earthkind/landscape/proper-pruning-techniques/\"><code>Educate yourself on how and why</code></a><code>Â </code><a\nhref=\"http://ep.yimg.com/ay/yhst-136001134851880/forester-8-1-4-by-pass-pro-forged-pruner-pr7240-3.jpg\"><code>1</code></a><br />\n<a\nhref=\"https://www.nationalforests.org/who-we-are/our-impact/angeles\"><code>BIG TUJUNGA CANYON RESTORATION</code></a></p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>Head through the locked gate and follow the fire road a short ways\ndown to the head of the canyon at ___________</p>\n<p>There is a corrugated metal drainage heading into the canyon on your\nleft. Pretty soon after dropping in you should see a really old beat up\nbug (canyons namesake).</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>There is a 15-20ft downclimb right above the first rappel. There are\nnumerous anchor options if anyone is uncomfortable and wants to rappel\nthis. It may be less precarious climbing down canyon left, although\nthere's more brush and poison oak.</p>\n<p>Rappel 1:</p>\n<p>Rappel 5: 60-70ft? cascade using a cairn anchor center canyon</p>\n<p>Rappel 6: 100ft? Anchored off a small tree down canyon left.\nBeautiful, vertical falls with usually just a small trickle down into\nBig Tujunga</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>At the bottom of the final rappel head left, going downstream in Big\nTujunga Canyon. There is a trail going up the next big ridge (LDC). This\nis the same trail used for Josephine, Great Falls of the Fox, White Oak\netc. The first part of the trail is really just a scramble up the side\nof a steep slope but it soon develops into a real trail, although it is\nnot maintained.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n",
