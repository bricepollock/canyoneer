It uses the same exit trail as Josephine and Great Falls of the Fox\n<\/p>\n<ul><li><ul><li>As with all the Big T canyons your help is needed to keep access open. This entire area is still seeing a slow recovery from the old station fire which means lots of invasive plants and overgrowth in general can quickly close off access to these areas and\/or make your time in them miserable. Consider adding a pair of hand shears and\/or small bypass loppers to your gear list when descending these places.<\/li><\/ul><\/li><\/ul>\n<pre><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http:\/\/aggie-horticulture.tamu.edu\/earthkind\/landscape\/proper-pruning-techniques\/\">Educate yourself on how and why<\/a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"http:\/\/ep.yimg.com\/ay\/yhst-136001134851880\/forester-8-1-4-by-pass-pro-forged-pruner-pr7240-3.jpg\">[1]<\/a>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https:\/\/www.nationalforests.org\/who-we-are\/our-impact\/angeles\">BIG TUJUNGA CANYON RESTORATION<\/a>\n<\/pre>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Head through the locked gate and follow the fire road a short ways down to the head of the canyon at ___________\n<\/p><p>There is a corrugated metal drainage heading into the canyon on your left.
