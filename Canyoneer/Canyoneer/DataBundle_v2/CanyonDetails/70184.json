  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>A short tributary in the upper headwaters of Rodgers Creek - about\n1.5hrs from Portland. Not a bad one for the coast range with four\nrappels and a creek relatively free of brush. Approach and exit are\npretty easy/straightforward. It's even faster with a shuttle. Best in\nthe spring when it has water. Likely reduces to a trickle come\nMay/June.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A passenger vehicle can make it if driven carefully. High clearance\nmay be preferred.</li>\n<li>Diehard canyoneers might consider running both Rodger's Ladder and\nRodgers Creek NW in the same day.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>Follow an old logging track down the northwest side of the ridge to\ndrop into the creek a short distance above R1.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>Use caution as the creek is excessively slippery.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>R1: 30ft+ from a tree DCL. Can rappel or downclimb the second\ntier.</li>\n<li>R2: 30ft from a tree DCL.</li>\n<li>R3: 150ft from a tree DCL. Falls is ~75ft high, but more rope is\nrequired per the horizontal distance. Bolts might allow one to run the\nflow directly on the way down.</li>\n<li>R4: 40ft from a tree DCL. Drop down a short chute that most of the\ncreek funnels through.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>Head downstream a short distance until the western tributary of\nRodgers Creek merges on the right. A short distance further, cross the\ncreek to the south side and climb up into an old clearcut. Make your way\nup to an old track that makes a rising traverse up to the nose of the\nridge. Once on the nose, break right and up to a track top the ridge and\nfollow it to the road.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<p>None.</p>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n<p>First descended by Kevin Clark and Keith Langenwalter in April\n2022.</p>\n"
