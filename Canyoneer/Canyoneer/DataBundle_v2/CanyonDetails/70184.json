Not a bad one for the coast range with four rappels and a creek relatively free of brush. Approach and exit are pretty easy\/straightforward. It's even faster with a shuttle. Best in the spring when it has water. Likely reduces to a trickle come May\/June.\n<\/p>\n<ul><li>A passenger vehicle can make it if driven carefully. High clearance may be preferred.<\/li>\n<li>Diehard canyoneers might consider running both <a href=\"\/w\/index.php?title=Rogers_Ladder&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Rogers Ladder (page does not exist)\">Rogers Ladder<\/a> and <a href=\"\/w\/index.php?title=Rogers_Creek_NW&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Rogers Creek NW (page does not exist)\">Rogers Creek NW<\/a> in the same day. This double-feature was ran May 2024 and found to be a great combo. Exit up the slope immediately DCL after the NW trib. Substantial game trails (elk?) lead up to a bench in the slope that is visible on topo maps. Traverse east to the creek. After some creek walking downstream, the ladder begins.<\/li>\n<li>A good view point for determining flow has not yet been discovered.<\/li><\/ul>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Follow an old logging track down the northwest side of the ridge to drop into the creek a short distance above R1.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Use caution as the creek is excessively slippery.\n<\/p>\n<ul><li>R1: 30ft  from a tree DCL.
