Please make sure you have adequate experience\/comfort and ability of high stemming 60'  for numerous hours before contemplating descending this canyon.  A ramp up with R\/X experience is strongly encouraged.\n<\/p><p>If you have no X experience, you’re in the wrong place to test out your abilities.  You’ve been warned! ❌❌\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Starting at the Red Well TH, you follow the trail to the North\/NE down to Dry Fork.  Climb up to the south of the canyon drainage until you reach the top.  Gear up and get ready!\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>The canyon rock quality isn't the greatest, lots of flaky goodness, mixed in with mossy\/crumbly walls. There are 3 distinct canyon sections.\n<\/p><p><b>Section 1:<\/b> X to X  with many options for passage (mid-level to high, depending on comfort).  Series of small 15-20' downclimbs that are followed by a quick upclimb to gain the right line going forward.  There are a few squeezes that will pinch you tight (185lbs) as you come around turns out of a silo, awkwardly shimmying upwards downcanyon to only pop out again to more of the same.  Eventually downclimbing to a sandy bottom and a rest.\n<\/p><p><b>Section 2:<\/b> XX. Shortly after the rest spot a definitive ledge midcanyon leads you into the business.  More mossy\/flaky walls and quite a few Pintac style upclimbs to get up and over pinches in the slot at eye level (debris and small rocks lodged in the pinch that is maybe 6-8' wide).  Following one of the bigger upclimbs you will drop into a more curvaceous silo section that can eventually lead you to the ground if you want to explore).  Back up 30-40' is where smooth sailing is found.  The bottom drops out more as light becomes minimal through the most beautiful section of slot.  Numerous squeezes that pop you into a silo requiring attentive navigation.  Finally you reach the crux (\"ejector seat\").  From a wide off-width move you can pop up and stem high (20-30') over the pinch to arrive at the top of the ejector, a large silo with minimal features in a smeary\/completely vertical crack.  The wall eventually gives way and forces you outward.  The safe move is to NOT go up and over, but rather elevator downward\/forward through the opening to place you at the bottom of the silo.  Then work your way back up with a somewhat physical upclimb to get over the next pinch and continue forward.  After a few more turns, you reach a silo that forces you down to the ground.  Crawl through and take a rest before the end.\n<\/p><p><b>Section 3:<\/b> The finale is enough to keep you attentive, with more of the same X movement.  Much shorter in duration, and after 30-45min ... you're out.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Retrace your steps back to Red Well TH.
