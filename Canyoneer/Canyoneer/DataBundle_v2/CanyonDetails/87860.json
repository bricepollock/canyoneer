class=\"mw-content-ltr mw-parser-output\" lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><p>Short, steep hollow; 2 40-55’ raps, the last rappel is directly into the Buffalo River\n<\/p><p>This hollow is quite short but steep. From the point where you drop into the hollow until you land in the river is only about 1030’ (0.20 miles), but you lose approximately 500’ of elevation, which yields a slope of about 49%. The upper hollow is a thrash but the two drops at the end, especially the rap into the river, make up for the misery of the upper hollow.\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>From the Ponca low water bridge parking area, walk under the Hwy. 74 bridge and stay on the left side of the Buffalo River (facing downstream) and walk along the Old River Trail. The cliff band you can see downstream on the left side of the river is where you will ultimately rappel into the river.\n<\/p><p>Find your way above that cliffband where you can (we followed a game trail and found a slope that led us above). From there, head steeply uphill towards 36° 1'37.38\"N, 93°21'29.09\"W; do your best to dodge the ubiquitous poison ivy. That should put you in the head of the target hollow. Head downstream.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>The upper hollow is incredibly steep and filled with debris and briars. Given how short this hollow is, it doesn't hold much water and isn't cleaned out by floods. Make your way downstream as gracefully as you can. Eventually you'll come to an approximately 50’ drop at around 1150’ of elevation. To descend, we built a retrievable anchor from a sturdy cedar on creek right and rapped double stranded. The drop is vertical and slightly undercut.\n<\/p><p>Keep your harness on after this drop. Very soon thereafter, you’ll come to the final drop, which is approximately 45’-55’ in height and basically vertical. From the top of the drop, you'll have a beautiful view up and down the Buffalo River. This rappel will put you right in the river in a deep pool at the base of the cliff. We built a retrievable anchor on creek right and rapped single stranded. Even when the flow in the Buffalo is really low, as it was on the day we hiked the hollow, water will be present here; it’s the deepest part of the channel and forms a nice swimming hole. The pool was approximately 8 feet deep. I wouldn’t attempt this rappel if the Buffalo is flowing strongly.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>To return to the car, we stayed in the channel of the river and walked back to the Ponca low water bridge.
