All credit to the AIC. \n<\/p><p>Called \"Bus del Diavolo\" meaning \"Hole of the Devil\" by the locals, it is a very deep gorge traversed by turbulent waters, where for two-thirds of the way, not a single ray of, sunlight can be seen, and blue sky is a very rare sight. This gorge is also known by the name \"Apocalypse Now,\" a name that comprehensively describes the chaos encountered when traversing it. The average flow rate is around 2000 liters per second, making it a highly technical gorge suitable ONLY for experienced canyoners capable of using specific techniques to deal with whirlpool basins or dangerous situations. On the website of the Dam Office of the Autonomous Province of Trento, you can find flow values updated every 15 minutes to assess the canyon's flow rate based on weather conditions:\n<\/p><p>Note: The canyon gets very aquatic above 2.6 at the gauge.\n<\/p><p><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https:\/\/www.floods.it\/public\/Charts.php?Sensori%5B%5D=30423\">River Gauge<\/a>\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Downstream access: From Trento, take the SS 47 along the Valsugana Valley in the direction of Padova until you reach the town of Grigno. Leave the first car near the town hall or the Alpino bar in the town center.\n<\/p><p>Upstream access: with the second car, exit the town and follow the left bank of the Grigno stream on the provincial road SP 75 towards Castello Tesino for about 12 km. Then follow the signs for Pieve Tesino on the SP 78 until you reach an intersection, where you follow the directions for Cinte Tesino on SP 114. Once in the village of Cinte Tesino, drive through it, taking the road to the left of the Circolo Anziani Club (Via Mol√®ta), and continue straight on Via del Capitello for about 1.7 km, keeping left at the two previous forks. Continue until you reach another fork and take the paved road to the right (very steep) that leads to some lower farmhouses. As you go down, the road becomes unpaved; continue, leaving a slightly uphill path to the right, until you reach a series of very winding hairpin bends. The road then re-enters the forest, where near a left-hand curve, you will find a small parking area (610 m above sea level). Here, there is a wooden signpost for the gorge marked \"Apocalypse Now.\"\n<\/p><p>Approach: from the parking area, follow the signpost to the right and continue on the well-marked trail that initially descends on the right bank, which is very simple at first but becomes increasingly exposed. Be very careful in this part, as there is a risk of falling into the gorge below. At the end of the trail, on the right, there is a rocky platform (elevation 510 m) with the chain for the first descent and a sign from the mountain rescue service indicating the characteristics of the gorge.\n<\/p>\n<style data-mw-deduplicate=\"TemplateStyles:r1062633282\">@media all and (max-width:720px){.mw-parser-output .content .thumb>div:not(.thumbinner){display:flex;justify-content:center;flex-wrap:wrap;align-content:flex-start;flex-direction:column}}body.skin-vector .mw-parser-output div.thumb>div:not(.thumbinner){font-size:94%;text-align:center;overflow:hidden;min-width:100px}body.skin-minerva .mw-parser-output div.thumb>div:not(.thumbinner){margin:0 auto;max-width:100%!important}<\/style> \n<div class=\"thumb tright\">\n<div style=\"display:table;\">\n<span class=\"mw-default-size\" typeof=\"mw:Error mw:File\/Frameless\">\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<link rel=\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\" href=\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1062633282\"> \n<div class=\"thumb tright\">\n<div style=\"display:table;\">\n<span class=\"mw-default-size\" typeof=\"mw:Error mw:File\/Frameless\">\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<link rel=\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\" href=\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1062633282\"> \n<div class=\"thumb tright\">\n<div style=\"display:table;\">\n<span class=\"mw-default-size\" typeof=\"mw:Error mw:File\/Frameless\">\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Return: after the last pitch, the gorge ends, and the stream widens significantly. After about 15-20 minutes, you will reach a large weir (elevation 314 m) with a drop of about 10 meters (not suitable for jumping!). Follow the visible path that ascends to the right (not the one that descends) until you intersect the forest road. In 5 minutes of descent, you will arrive at the main square of the town of Grigno.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Red_tape\">Red tape<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Beta_sites\">Beta sites<\/h2><\/div>\n<ul><li>Complete information, with access and a topo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https:\/\/www.canyonofdolomites.it\/en\/canyons\/canyon-grigno-apocalipse-now.html\">Grigno at Canyon of Dolomites<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http:\/\/descente-canyon.com\/canyoning\/canyon-description\/2558\">Descente-Canyon.com<\/a> &#160;: Grigno<\/li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http:\/\/canyon.carto.net\/cwiki\/bin\/view\/Canyons\/TorrenteGrignoCanyon\">Canyon.Carto.net<\/a> &#160;: Forra del Grigno<\/li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http:\/\/cicarudeclan.com\/ita\/a5_grigno.htm\">CicaRudeClan.com<\/a> &#160;: Forra del Grigno<\/li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http:\/\/catastoforre.aic-canyoning.it\/index\/forra\/cod\/TN001\">Catastoforre AIC-Canyoning.it<\/a> &#160;: Torrente Grigno;Apocalypse Now<\/li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http:\/\/ropewiki.com\/User:Canyoning_in_the_Alps_Book?id=Grigno\">Canyoning in the Alps Book by Simon Flower<\/a> &#160;: Grigno<\/li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http:\/\/ropewiki.com\/User:Canyoning_Nord_Italia_Book?id=Grigno\">Canyoning Nord Italia Book by Pascal van Duin<\/a> &#160;: Grigno<\/li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http:\/\/gulliver.it\/itinerario\/2525\/\">Gulliver.it<\/a> &#160;: Apocalipse now<\/li><\/ul>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Background\">Background<\/h2><\/div>\n\n\n<\/div>","rappelCountMin":15,"vehicle":null,"version":"7e3ce372a47107a293947b234385a0bcfa42e46f058139e4a35c436552880d14","name":"Grigno","technicalRating":4,"latitude":46.0403,"waterRating":"C2","quality":4.3,"longitude":11.6268,"shuttleSeconds":null,"riskRating":"R","rappelCountMax":15,"rappelLongestMeters":25,"url":"https:\/\/ropewiki.com\/Grigno","id":12056}
