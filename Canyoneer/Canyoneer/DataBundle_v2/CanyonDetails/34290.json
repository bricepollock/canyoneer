  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>Elephant Canyon-Lower Salt Creek Loop is a route in the Needles\nDistrict of Canyonlands National Park.</p>\n<p>Ascending up Lower Salt Creek requires climbing skills. There is one\n15' upclimb of 5.6 in difficulty, so having a good climber along is\nrecommended. THIS IS A LEGIT CLASS 5.6 CLIMBING MOVE. YOU MUST HAVE A\nCLIMBER IN THE GROUP OR YOU MAY BE TURNED AROUND AND FACE AN ADDITIONAL\n8+ HRS. TO EXIT THE SOUTHER ROUTE. There may be webbing there but you\ncan not rely on it remaining.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p><strong>Trailhead</strong></p>\n<p>The trailhead is at the Big Spring Overlook Trailhead in the Needles\nsection of Canyonlands National Park.</p>\n<p><strong>Approach Hike</strong></p>\n<p>Follow the Confluence Overlook Trail as it descends a couple hundred\nfeet to the Big Spring Canyon bottom, crosses it and up the other side.\nContinue along the trail until it drops into Elephant Canyon. This is\nabout 1.5 miles from the trailhead.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>Follow Elephant Canyon down canyon from the trail. After about a\nmile, there is a drop off at 38.1873, -109.8370.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>R1: 30ft freehang from small hanging bush</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Continue hiking down the drainage for about 1 mile until you reach a\nbig drop off at 38.1990, -109.8465. If you brought a long enough rope\nyou can rappel this. Otherwise, traverse the left rim about 500 feet to\na short drop off the cliff band at 38.2022, -109.8466.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>R2: 15ft from a boulder wrap or partner assist.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Hike about another mile to the next drop off at 38.2081, -109.8478\nand the next rappel.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>R3: 80ft freehang from a boulder horn located underneath a saucer\njust right of the pour off. It is easy to miss. You have to downclimb 5\nfeet to see the then red webbing.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Hike down the drainage about a 1/2 mile to the next and final drop\noff at 38.2122, -109.8489.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>R4: 55ft freehang from a scrub oak on the lip. This rappel can be\nbypassed on canyon right by scrambling down a scree and boulder slope,\nbut what fun is that</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Following, there are many Crinoids along with red and black chert.\nRight before you reach the Colorado River, look up 50 feet or so on the\nright side and locate some Anasazi ruins.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>There are two options here.</p>\n<p><strong>Up River and Out Lower Salt Creek Canyon</strong></p>\n<p>This is the more scenic option, but be warned. There is a 20' rock\npitch to climb (often wet) so have a good climber with you.</p>\n<p>Upon reaching the Colorado River, head upriver for 0.5 mile up the\nriver to the mouth of Salt Creek. If the water is high the bushwhacking\nthrough the tamarisk and scrambling on loose rubble is tedious and\nrequires some good route finding skills as you will have to climb up and\nover some small cliff bands and could take an hour. If the river is low\nyou can walk along the flat bank most of the way and it will only take\n1/2 hour.</p>\n<p>Once you reach the mouth of Salt Creek, begin hiking up the wash\nwhich is often dry at this point. Follow the deep canyon up as it makes\na broad U turn and slowly works its way east. Salt Creek has five drops\nyou will need to climb up. Four of them are easy scrambles but the\nsecond one as you head up canyon, located about 1.5 miles from the river\nrequires a 20-foot rock climb which usually has a trickle waterfall next\nto it. There are two pitons that can be used to protect the climb if you\ncan locate them. There are a couple old star bolts at the top.</p>\n<p>Once above the climb, continue up canyon as it gradually opens up and\npasses by three more short scrambles which may be damp. Water is easily\nfound in this canyon most of the year which can be filtered for use.\nExcellent camping is found on a flat bench a few minutes above the\nup-climb.</p>\n<p>One mile above the 20-foot climb there will be a large junction and\nyou will want to turn right and continue south up the Big Spring Canyon\ndrainage to return to your car at Big Spring Overlook. Do not continue\nup Salt Creek. A short distance further, turn right again at another\njunction to stay in Big Spring Canyon. You will come to a big drop you\ncan avoid by hiking up a trail on the west side marked by a cairn. The\nfinal mile and a half has some minor bushwhacking.</p>\n<p>Immediately below the parking area, you will have to climb up a\nbuttress on the southwest side of the canyon to bypass one last drop\n(which is the one seen from the parking area overlook). There is a short\n4th class spot to gain a wide ledge which is followed around and above\nthe canyon bottom. Once past the drop, descend back to the bottom and\nmeet the trail back to the cars.</p>\n<p><strong>Down River</strong></p>\n<p>This is one option. From the mouth of Elephant Canyon, hike down\nriver to the area of \"The Slide\" (on the opposite bank). This is about\n1.7 miles down canyon. Climb up the drainage to the south and up the\neasternmost gully to the rim of the canyon. This is a rugged route. From\nthe rim you are free to route find back to the trailhead.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<p>Permits are needed for overnight hikes. Lower Elephant Canyon and\nlower Salt Creek are closed from March 15 to September 1 to protect big\nhorn sheep habitat.
