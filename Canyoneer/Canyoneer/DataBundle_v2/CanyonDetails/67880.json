  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>Not a very interesting canyon. Nonetheless, the last 150m of\nelevation are made of a succesion of roughly 10 abseils, before that you\nwalk a lot and abseil a few single obstacles.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>Park at the exit of the canyon. Go up by cablecar (to Unterbäch),\nfrom which you can see how much you will walk in the canyon XD Go down\nthrough the village and then a affluent valley which probably has no\nwater most of the time during the year.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>Walk 500m through many trees, have 2 Waterfalls, walk another 1000m\nbefore you again abseil twice. Walk yet again 500m before you reach the\ninteresting part of the canyon, which is made of roughly 10-15 rappels\nup to 20m.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>Just follow the river for about 100m, that will get you immediatly to\nyour car.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n<p>Some anchors are really old and not all are completely\ntrustworthy.</p>\n"
