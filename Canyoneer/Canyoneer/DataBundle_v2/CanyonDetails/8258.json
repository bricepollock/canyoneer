  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>The Kazaumra Cave system is the longest lava tube in the world. It\nhas multiple drops, some of them majestic lava falls that look like they\nwere flowing last week. Some offer commercial or semi-commercial\ntours.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>The system has several entrances, mostly collapsed ceiling or walls,\nthat allows access to just short sections or to do a through trip from\nthe top of the volcano almost all the way to the ocean.</p>\n<p>The cave crosses a number of private properties, so make sure you\nhave permission to access where you start and where you are going to get\nout. Passage below private property through the lava tube is not\ntechnically allowed without permission of each landowner with the\nexception, on the Big Island, of three tour companies specifically\nauthorized by law<a href=\"#fn1\" class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref1\"\nrole=\"doc-noteref\"><sup>1</sup></a>. Anecdotally, most people do not\nseem concerned with enforcing the in-tube travel restrictions, but land\nowners with entrances are often very concerned with people using them as\nentrances or exits.</p>\n<p>Some information on entrance locations and access can be found <a\nhref=\"http://punaweb.org/forum/pop_printer_friendly.asp?TOPIC_ID=11141\">here</a>.\nTwo of the three authorized tour companies operate in the Kazamura\nsystem:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://kazumuracave.com/\">Kazamuracave.com</a> offers tours\nof what may be more interesting sections of the tube closer to the\nvolcano, including one where you are required to bring your own vertical\ngear.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://kilaueacavernsoffire.com\">Kilauea Caverns of\nFire</a> offers tours of a section of the tube down-mountain from\nkazamuracave.com, including an all-day non-technical through-trip walk\nup-mountain in the lava tube covering 2.1 miles of straight-line\ndistance with 320 ft of elevation gain.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.kulakaicaverns.com\">Kula Kai Caverns</a> is\nlocated far to the southwest of this area.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<h3 id=\"kilauea_caverns_of_fire\">Kilauea Caverns of Fire</h3>\n<p>Enter the lava tube at the Cow entrance (Fern's Cave) descending a\n~12ft ladder and proceed uphill with your guide. The tube has a number\nof short side passages, but all dead-end shortly or rejoin the main\npassage. There are a few brief scrambles and one or two easy crawls, but\nthe tube is mostly a straight-forward walk all the way to an exit on\nprivate property 2.1 miles away (though the hike is longer) owned by a\nperson with an interesting story you will likely hear on the tour.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<p>See <a\nhref=\"https://www.capitol.hawaii.gov/session2002/bills/SB2898_cd1_.htm\">here</a>\nfor Hawaiian law regarding caves/lava tubes.
