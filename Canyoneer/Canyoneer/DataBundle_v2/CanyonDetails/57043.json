  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>Klickitat County is a wonderful place to sit back and feel the\nfreedom of the open range. You’ll get that and more at Skookum\nCanyon.</p>\n<p>Be aware: while Skookum can be exciting and fun in the early season\nwith higher flows, it runs dry by late summer or fall. Not recommended\nto run in the summer. Expect a fair amount of bushwhacking in the creek\nwhich would be even harder if the vegetation was leafed out... so this\none is best visited early in the year. There are some nice sections of\nbedrock occasionally along the descent.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ticks apparently can be a problem at certain times of the year.</li>\n<li>There is some poison oak in the lower canyon. (Another reason to\nvisit early in the year.)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>Park at a pullout just east of Skookum Creek on Hwy 142 east (~3min\nout of Klickitat Town). Note the berm blocking an access road on the\nnorth side. Climb over and hike up short trail to the Company Road\n(closed logging road). Walk west for 2min to a junction and turn left on\nold jeep trail straight up the ridge on the east/north side of the creek\nall the way to the powerlines. Follow the powerline track east and break\noff down meadowed slopes to the top of R1. The first falls is located\njust downstream of where the powerline crosses the creek.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Checkpoint: Before leaving the cars, walk west on Hwy 142 and have a\nlook at the flow on Skookum Creek.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>R1- Keyhole Falls 120’ from boulder DCL. This rappel is potentially\nhazardous and does require a careful DCR to DCL step or jump very close\nto the lip of the waterfall to rappel down safely. In higher flow, it\nmay be wiser for most groups to avoid. There is ample area at the top to\nassess. This is the crux of Skookum.</p>\n<p>R2- Chutes and Ladders Falls 200’ from bolt station DCR. More rope is\nrequired to reach the pool at the bottom, but the pull will suck,\nparticularly in high flow. It may be best not to rappel the final tier\nand instead pull from a dry platform DCL. You can bypass the last drop\nby scrambling over a mini-ridge DCL.</p>\n<p>Below R2, the creek becomes a thrashfest for some distance. Continue\ndownstream wherever is easiest, crossing the creek when needed.\nEventually locate a game trail DCR that runs along steep slopes which is\neasy walking, then just cut down to the top of R3.</p>\n<p>There's an interesting looking chute not too far above R3.</p>\n<p>R3- Skookum Falls</p>\n<ul>\n<li>High flow: Use 2-bolt station high DCR that is well out of the\nwater. (~120ft??)</li>\n<li>Low flow: 2-bolt station low DCR from nice platform in 2 stages.\nDistance is about 102ft. A doubled 200ft rope will not reach. The first\ndrop takes you into a deep hanging pool and to the flow of the main\nattraction.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>From R3, walk down stream 150 feet until the canyon opens. You have\nan option to bail out of the canyon here. Game trails will take you up\nand out of the creek DCL back to the ridge. Other game trails DCR will\ntake you to the top of a plateau area (very thrashy) which then opens\nand leads to a fast exit.</p>\n<p>There are 2-3 shorter drops (10-12ft range) below R3 but they are\ndown-climbable. There may also be some short slides. These have not yet\nbeen explored. Creek may be very thrashy in sections. There's also some\nfairly nice sections of bedrock closer to the Company Road.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Staying in the creek: keep going until you reach the Company Road.\nExit on trail DCL and drop down the far side of the road to your\ncar.</li>\n<li>DCL bailout after R3: side hill using pronounced game trails until\nyou reach the old jeep trail and descend to your car.</li>\n<li>DCR bailout after R3: side hill for about 0.3mi, then make your way\nup through thick brush to the plateau around 900ft elevation. Head\ndirectly south across the plateau and drop down open slopes to the\nCompany Road. Walk east, ford the creek, then descend to your car.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<p>None.</p>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<p><a\nhref=\"https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=wiAiAsim3oE\">https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=wiAiAsim3oE</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n<p>Skookum was first descended in early spring 2019 by Ryan Ernst,\nHaruka James Clay Lipscomb, and Shawn Bereaux.</p>\n",
