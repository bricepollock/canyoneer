{"description":"<div class=\"mw-content-ltr mw-parser-output\" lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><p>Dorr Canyon, named on all San Gabriel maps, descends steeply from the north face of Throop Peak, eventually merging with Big Rock Creek far below. This is a pristine San Gabriel High Country Canyon with virtually no evidence of any human presence. There is one definite 70 foot rappel, and 3 or 4 other smaller rappels or handlines, some of which may be bypassed. The lower portion is lined with mountain alder and is particularly lovely with a number of small falls and pools. Drop in off SR2, and it's all descent to the car shuttle on Big Rock Creek Road.\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Travel up the Angeles Crest Highway (SR2) from La Canada or from Wrightwood to Big Rock Creek Road, on the north side of Vincent Gap at location 34.373751, -117.752305. Drive down Big Rock Creek Road. Note that this road is unpaved for about 2 miles, but not too rough, and we were able to make it in a Prius. The road becomes paved again, and after about 1 mile you will park the shuttle car at a pull off on Big Rock Creek Road at location 34.392933, -117.787348. You can look up Dorr Canyon from here, or at some point close to here along the road, and actually see your drop-in point on SR2 far above. Now drive back up Big Rock Creek to SR2 and turn right (west). Travel about 4 miles to the drop in point at a large graded pull out at Dorr Canyon at location 34.358233, -117.798306, which is east of Dawson Saddle. Note that SR2 is often closed in the winter between Vincent Gap and Windy Gap because of snow so make sure to call ahead or check road closures.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>The canyon is obvious from the drop in location. Drop down right off the highway into the very steep scree slope as best you can. You may want to rappel this. The first and largest rappel is encountered after .65 mile and is 70' or so from cairn anchor. You will probably have to construct a new cairn anchor. The canyon appears to have a history of substantial water flow at times, and may turn out to be rather nice following a very wet winter. There are several small falls and slides in nicely sculpted rock segments, with what will probably be fairly deep pools when cleared of current gravel debris.   There are a couple long and fairly tough bushwhacking segments with alder thickets in the upper half now. Otherwise it's mostly non-technical but pristine, wild, tranquil, and beautiful.\n<\/p>\n<style data-mw-deduplicate=\"TemplateStyles:r1062633282\">@media all and (max-width:720px){.mw-parser-output .content .thumb>div:not(.thumbinner){display:flex;justify-content:center;flex-wrap:wrap;align-content:flex-start;flex-direction:column}}body.skin-vector .mw-parser-output div.thumb>div:not(.thumbinner){font-size:94%;text-align:center;overflow:hidden;min-width:100px}body.skin-minerva .mw-parser-output div.thumb>div:not(.thumbinner){margin:0 auto;max-width:100%!important}<\/style> \n<div class=\"thumb tright\">\n<div style=\"display:table;\">\n<div class=\"thumbcaption\" style=\"display:table-caption;caption-side:bottom;box-sizing:border-box;\">{{{caption}}} <\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>After about 4 miles you exit the canyon into a wide boulder field.
