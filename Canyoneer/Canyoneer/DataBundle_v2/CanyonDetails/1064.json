only, all others go 150 yards east to the Franklin Falls lot.\nFrom the Franklin falls parking, take the trail at the west end over to the Denny Creek parking.  Cross the river and a trail starts at the abandoned turn around.  Hike up the Denny Creek Trail, going under I90.\nYou'll cross the river DCL to DCR at some slabs - There are logs that you can cross to keep your feet dry.  This is your main exit.\nKeep hiking up, passing Keekwulee Falls until you cross Denny Creek again, this time from DCR to DCL. Here, suit up and head downstream.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p><b>NOTE:<\/b> Rappels will likely need to be re-built.
