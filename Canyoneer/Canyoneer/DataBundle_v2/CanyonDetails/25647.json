  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>A beautiful and fun 4x4 drive through some nice meadows and pine\nforest leading you into the Wet Beaver Wilderness Area. The canyon has\nfour rappels, numerous down climbs, swims, wades, scrambles, Quadi Mundi\nand some nice sections of narrows.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>From the car park hike southwest for 0.6 miles down a moderate\nslopping hill to drop into the canyon.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>The descent is a little over 1 mile to the confluence of Tin Roof and\nWet Beaver Creek. It appears we were the first descent as we had to\nbuild anchors at every drop. Head right up canyon for another 1.1 miles\nthrough a very scenic and remote section of Wet Beaver Creek consisting\nof several swims through crystal clear pools and narrows, a few springs\nand some cliff jumping. Its possible an overnight camp in Beaver creek\nwould be best if you want to take your time otherwise getting an early\nstart from the car would be wise. We camped at a nice campsite with a\nfire pit along Beaver creek and completed the loop the following day. We\nalso ran into a family of Coati's with several babies in tow.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>You will need to scramble up to the left to get around a few dry\nfalls then simply head up the drainage to the top and your car.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a\nhref=\"https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.1248156418538129.1073742012.100000313473011&amp;type=3\">https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.1248156418538129.1073742012.100000313473011&amp;type=3</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n<p>First Descent by Jay Wisocki</p>\n",
