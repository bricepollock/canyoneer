  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>This page describes the upper section of Fulton Creek. This a short\nand sweet canyon with several scenic rappels. Great for a last day of a\nweekend trip in the Olympics, or as a full day combined with other\ncanyons in the area.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"Lower_Fulton_Creek\" title=\"wikilink\">Lower Fulton Creek</a>\nis separate section of the canyon and has been broken out into its own\npage. It is possible to run both the upper and lower sections of this\ncreek in one trip, but expect a much longer day out. (See \"Middle\nFulton\" below for more information.) Lower Fulton has about twice the\nwater of Upper Fulton.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Watershed: 4.1mi^2. Highest point in the watershed is North Rock at\n~4200' elevation.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>Just north of Triton Cove State Park, turn left off Hwy 101 onto\nSeamount Dr. Follow the road upwards for ~2mi to Jct 969 where there's\nroom for several cars. Note that the road gets very rough after the\npavement ends and there are a number of deep drainage berms. High\nclearance (possibly 4WD) recommended; use extreme caution with 2WD\nvehicles that you care about.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Apparently, a number of canyoneers have been parking at the end of\nthe pavement and either hiking or carpooling up the road. While\ntechnically legal to park here, there a number of private homes\nextremely close by and the presence of cars may cause locals to wonder\nwhat you're up to and/or suspect you're up to no good. To alleviate\ntheir concerns, it may be better to park 2WD vehicles elsewhere (ex:\nTriton Cove State Park -- Discovery Pass required) and carpool up to\nFulton in a high-clearance vehicle.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>As of 2022: it is no longer possible to drive down to the drop in. A\nlarge berm and ditch barricades the road. You'll need to park at the\njunction and hike in.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>From the junction, just walk down the road to the creek. There is a\nsmall campsite at the very end of the road where the old bridge used to\nbe. Just before the campsite, look left to find a motorbike trail\nleading into the creek. Hike down the creek about 20min to the first\nrappel.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Alternatively, check the map for a shortcut route that drops you in\njust above the technical section. This cuts off about 0.5mi of\nhiking.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p><strong>DCR</strong> = Down Canyon Right</p>\n<p><strong>DCL</strong> = Down Canyon Left</p>\n<p>Use caution as this creek seems unusually slippery. While hiking\nbetween rappels, beware leg-eating gaps between rocks that can be hidden\nunder the water.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>R1</strong>: 60' DCL from 2 unlinked bolts into a beautiful\namphitheater. <strong>DO NOT ADD WEBBING TO THESE BOLTS!</strong> Debris\nfrom floods can catch on linked bolts and severely damage them. Groups\nshould be familiar with rigging unlinked bolts.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>R2</strong>: 80' from webbing around a log in the center of\nthe creek. There is a small pool in the middle of the rappel.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>R3</strong>: 110' DCR from webbing around a tree that's\nfallen across the creek. This is a 2-stage rappel with a large pool in\nthe middle. There is a log in the watercourse at the bottom of the\nsecond tier which is very easy to avoid while on rappel, but take care\nwhen pulling your rope as it can get caught around it.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>There is a 15' downclimb through a mini-slot shortly after R3.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>A short distance further down canyon is a large logjam. Downclimb or\nrappel. For extra bonus points, check out the cool boulder cave on the\nDCR side of the creek.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>Below the log jam, keep going until it becomes easy to climb out of\nthe creek DCL. If it's steep &amp; brushy, you're in the wrong place. A\nsmall cairn marks the exit. Head up into a shallow draw and make your\nway uphill on game trails to the canyon rim (~300ft gain). The going is\nrelatively easy until you reach the top where the terrain abruptly\nlevels out and you enter an old clear-cut. Do not try to cross the\nclear-cut directly (it's a serious bushwhack), but instead turn left and\nfollow the along the top of the canyon rim as best you can. It's a\nlittle brushy, but not too bad. After a few minutes, pop out on the road\nand walk back to your car. (2min).</p>\n<h2 id=\"middle_fulton\">Middle Fulton</h2>\n<p>For a much longer day, it's possible to continue on down the creek\nand run <a href=\"Lower_Fulton_Creek\" title=\"wikilink\">Lower Fulton\nCreek</a>. From the exit described above, it's about a half-mile of\ntypical Olympic creek-walking and rock-hopping. There are several minor\ndownclimbs and a few logjams to climb over / go around / go through.\nThere are two short sections of narrows along the way. The first begins\nabout 300ft downstream of the aforementioned exit. The creek constricts\nsuddenly with a big logjam completely blocking passage.</p>\n<p><strong>First Narrows</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>M-R1: 10ft. Climb up onto the logjam and rappel off a log into a\nshort narrows below.</li>\n<li>Short drop. Downclimb or jump into the next pool.</li>\n<li>There's an short interesting sequence of pools/channels ahead that\nlooks like it could be fun, but it was barricaded by a strainer in 2022.\nWe bypassed DCR.</li>\n<li>M-R2: 20ft from log.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Hike about 0.2mi.</p>\n<p><strong>Second Narrows</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Short drop which can be easily downclimbed on the left. Do not jump\nas the pool is shallow.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>On exiting the second narrows, it's about 0.15mi to the entrance of\nLower Fulton. Watch for a tributary entering DCR as a sign that you're\nalmost there. Note that the water will about double below this\npoint.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<p>Be aware: the parking area, the exit to Upper Fulton, and Middle\nFulton are all on private timber company land. Access could be rescinded\nat any time, so please treat the area with respect and practice your\nbest Leave No Trace.</p>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n<p>Upper Fulton was first descended by Jake Huddleston, Kevin Steffa,\nBecca Polglase, Michelle Nilles, and Tiffanie Lin on July 5, 2020.</p>\n<p>Middle Fulton was explored by Kevin Clark, Hereward Cooper, and Alex\nDanielson in Sept 2022.</p>\n",
