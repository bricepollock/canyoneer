The road leads SW uphill and crosses One and a Half Mile Creek at approx. 2 miles. There are several options for accessing this creek. One is to hike down an abandoned logging road that starts approx. 3\/4 of a mile up Rocky Brook Road. The other options are to start your descent where the road crosses One and a Half Mile Creek or the unnamed tributary just before One and a Half Mile Creek on Rocky Brook Road.\n<\/p><p>The advantages of taking the abandoned logging road are that you will be about a mile closer to your car when you exit the Big Quilcene at Rainbow Campground. The logging road will take a sharp eye to identify as it veers off to the right from Rocky Creek Road. The hike down the logging road is level all the way to One and a Half Mile Creek. However it does require some bushwhacking as nature is working fast to reclaim this road.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading3\"><h3 id=\"One_and_a_Half_Mile_Creek\">One and a Half Mile Creek<\/h3><\/div>\n<p>From where the old logging road crosses One and a Half Mile Creek, head downstream several hundred yards to R1.\n<\/p>\n<ul><li>Slide into a pool.<\/li>\n<li>20ft with corkscrew turn to the left.<\/li>\n<li>40ft into a pool.
