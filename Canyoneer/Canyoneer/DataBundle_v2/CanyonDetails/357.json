  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>Less-traveled Zion canyon accessed along the East Mesa Trail close to\nMystery Canyon. Mostly a downclimbing bonanza that exits into Orderville\njust a short distance before water starts flowing. A couple short\nrappels with additional downclimbs that some may choose to rappel.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>Car shuttle: Park one car at the Zion Visitor Center. Take the other\ncar to the East Mesa trailhead where the approach starts. Parking is\nlimited and quickly fills especially on weekends. A paid shuttle is\navailable from Ponderosa with parking near the entrance to the property.\nAnother option is to take other commercial shuttle options from the Zion\nVisitor Center to the East Mesa trailhead to avoid the long car\nshuttle.</p>\n<p>Loop: Could also be approached by hiking up from Zion Canyon /\nWeeping Rock shuttle stop, however, the East Rim trail is currently\nclosed in this area due to rockfall (as of Oct 2022).</p>\n<p>Hike the East Mesa trail about 1.1 miles. The canyon head will be\nimmediately to the North but is somewhat obscured from the trail by\nbrush. A small use trail leads to the canyon. The drop in isn’t well\nestablished and is better a little to the East to avoid going straight\ndown and also getting cliffed out.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>Initial descent is steep and brushy. Make your way to a small gully\ncloser to the center of the canyon and avoid cliffs that appear on each\nside. As the slope becomes less brushy and you make your way below\ncliffs that start to appear there are a lot of loose rocks that can be\nquite dangerous for party members below each other.</p>\n<p>Much of the downclimbing through this area is steep and on loose\nrocks, webbing may be found before the first required rappel from\nparties that chose to rappel rather than downclimb.</p>\n<p>Rappel 1: 60’ off a large pine tree. Brushy area. Rappel 2: 25’ off a\nquestionable small tree DCL or using a deadman with numerous large rocks\navailable in the waterway.</p>\n<p>Canyon continues to drop and eventually level out to a wooded\nstreambed. Throughout are numerous downclimb challenges to figure out\nand enjoy. Some may want to rappel a couple of these, although all can\nbe downclimbed. There are also sections with numerous downed trees and\nbrush to navigate. Recommend doing everything possible to stay in the\nwaterway as the canyon itself is delightfully absent of footpaths on the\nbanks of the wash going around obstacles. Very pristine.</p>\n<p>Rappel 3: 30’ off bolts LDC and is within feet of where the canyon\nends at Orderville. This rappel is from a shelf of debris hanging over a\nsizable void, although it’s not obvious from the top.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>The canyon exits into Orderville. Heading down canyon Orderville\nquickly goes from dry to gently flowing water. Orderville’s second\nrappel and the usual required swimming spots heading to the Narrows will\nneed to be navigated on the way out.</p>\n<p>Follow Orderville to the Virgin River Narrows and out to the Temple\nof Sinwava to catch the shuttle back to the Visitors Center.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<p>Permits are required to enter and descend this canyon as it is\nlocated within the Zion National Park boundaries. Mis-me is not listed\non the Zion permits website so a trip to the Zion Backcountry desk will\nbe needed even for those with a Wilderness Express account. Mis-me exits\ninto Orderville within park boundaries so a permit for Mis-me will also\ncount toward the daily use limits for Orderville. A reservation for\nOrderville can be made on the Zion permits site ahead of time and then\nconverted to Mis-me at the wilderness desk day before or day of.</p>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><img src=\"rwl_en.png\" title=\"rwl_en.png\" alt=\"rwl_en.png\" /><a\nhref=\"http://bluugnome.com/cyn_route/zion/zion_mis-me/zion_mis-me-canyon.aspx\">BluuGnome.com</a>\n: Mis-Me Canyon</li>\n<li><img src=\"rwl_en.png\" title=\"rwl_en.png\" alt=\"rwl_en.png\" /><a\nhref=\"http://ropewiki.com/User:Super_Amazing_Map?id=Mis-Me_-_Zion_Area\">Super\nAmazing Map</a> : Mis-Me</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n",
