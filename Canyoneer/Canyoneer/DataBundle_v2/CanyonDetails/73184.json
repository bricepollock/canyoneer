  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>Easy canyon with a few downclimbs. More fun way to reach West Clear\nCreek than taking Calloway trail.</p>\n<p>Use FR-9693V to access. Also possible to access FR-9693V by going\ndown FR-142B which eventually meets up with FR-9693V. Road is pretty\nrough in spots with medium sized boulders, down trees, and rutted out\nroad.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>Follow FR-9693V towards canyon. Leave FR-9693V and head towards main\ncanyon or Bueno Tank. Canyon has a few down trees to hike through.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>Continue the a few down trees, overall not very brushy. A few fun\ndownclimbs.</p>\n<p><strong>R1:</strong> 40' optional off of tree. Also possible to\nbypass downclimbing RDC.</p>\n<p>A few more good downclimbs before reaching West Clear Creek.
