It offers sections of committed slot and deep pools unseen in most nearby canyons and features considerable bushwhacking, logjams, slippery downclimbing and water features. That being said, it wouldn't hold up against other class C canyons in the West; but, is one of the best local canyons for those living in the SLC\/Utah County area.\n<\/p><p><b>Note<\/b>: This page contains information for the Lower Fort Creek (aka Three Falls) route, which is the only track recorded on the map above. The full route is a combination of Upper and Lower Fort Creek routes and starts at 40°30'04.6\"N 111°45'52.3\"W.  Upper Fort Creek contains three low-angle rappels that can be avoided by downclimbing; but, won't be worth it for most since Lower Fort Creek contains all of the goods.  You can view the details for the full route by checking out the Upper Fort Creek ropeWiki page at: \n<\/p>\n<ul><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external free\" href=\"https:\/\/ropewiki.com\/Fort_Creek_(Upper)\">https:\/\/ropewiki.com\/Fort_Creek_(Upper)<\/a><\/li><\/ul>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>The best place to start is at the trailhead where the Three Falls hiking\/biking trail crosses North Three Falls Drive. Park on the side of the road here. After a few switchbacks and about 5 minutes of hiking--but before reaching the bridge that crosses Fort Creek--you will leave the maintained trail and follow a ridge upward to the north, northeast.  There is a very obvious social trail all the way up this ridge, but there are also a few intersecting trails where you can tell people have gotten off route in the past and, which could do the same to you, so keep you eyes open.  Following the GPX track posted on this page will pretty much keep you spot-on target the whole way.  Continue on foot up the ridge. There will be over 900 feet of elevation gain before you top out and drop into the drainage. Expect some bushwhacking, but good paths can be found through the scrub oak. Just before you top out there is an option to take the alternate, West Ridge Approach which is detailed bellow, otherwise stay on the social path to descend the standard, Erosion Gully route.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading3\"><h3 id=\"Standard_Approach_aka_the_Erosion_Gully\">Standard Approach aka the Erosion Gully<\/h3><\/div>\n<p>Follow the main social trail as it tops out and starts to descend down to the drainage.  The route down the gully gets loose and step in some places.  Footing is bad and you will slip and slide; but, this section of the approach is short and not too terrible.  Still, exercise caution and use tree branches as hand holds as you descend.  Despite being fairly well worn and obvious, by now, it is still easy to get off the main track here and have to bushwhack.\n<\/p><p>The Erosion Gully approach will drop you into the drainage at 40.49535, -111.76994.  You will encounter a handful of fun waterslides and the impressive Wall of Springs (RDC at 40.495978, -111.769808) as you descend the drainage to the point where the West Ridge Approach meets the drainage and to where the technical descent begins.  The spring can double the flow to the the creek at certain times of the year, FYI!\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading3\"><h3 id=\"West_Ridge_Approach\">West Ridge Approach<\/h3><\/div>\n<p>Before reaching the top of the hill cut to the left to GPS way point 40.49535,-111.76994.  This point will lead you out a ridge that runs towards the west and to a sloping hillside that ends in a cliff.  This cliff is 120 feet tall.  Put on your wet suits here before the rappel into the canyon.  The approach rappel (aka rappel 0) is anchored via some [yellow] webbing around the bottom of a fir tree on the right side of the ridge 3\/4 the way out the ridge. This rappel will drop you into the drainage right at the waters edge in a location right before the wall of springs that come out of the right side of the canyon.\n<\/p><p>This approach will skip a few fun water slides and the Wall of Springs as you enter the drainage below them.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading3\"><h3 id=\"West_Ridge_Approach_Rappels\">West Ridge Approach Rappels<\/h3><\/div>\n<ul><li><b>Rappel 0 (Approach Rappel)<\/b> (120 feet) This rappel is NOT in the watercourse and will ONLY be encountered if doing the ridge approach.

However, the city plans on putting no parking signs near where the trail crosses the road. This will likely push back parking on the road by a few hundred feet to up to 1000 feet away from the trail. The developers\/HOA in the area is attempting to have the city privatize the road so that the public are no longer allowed to park on North Three Falls Drive. If the road is privatized this will mean that the public will need park miles down the trail at the Three Falls Trailhead. This would make the route much longer for canyoneers unless you have a mountain bike, and even then it would be a full day. The developers don't currently have the votes on city council to get the road privatized, but that could easily change at the next election cycle. If you want public access to continue at the upper trailhead along North Three Falls Drive, let the city know.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Beta_sites\">Beta sites<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media<\/h2><\/div>\n<ul><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=T8udyiRvfsA\">YouTube.com<\/a>&#160;: What Some Guy Does, Canyoneering Three Falls (Fort Creek)<\/li><\/ul>\n<p><br \/>\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Background\">Background<\/h2><\/div>\n\n\n<\/div>","vehicle":"Passenger","quality":3.6,"riskRating":null,"months":["Sep","Oct","Nov","Jun","Jul","Aug"],"timeRating":"III","rappelCountMin":2,"rappelCountMax":7,"technicalRating":3,"name":"Fort Creek (Three Falls)","id":66902,"version":"70d6fa598ce4e6c4823d4899b50f04a8867937f3533ee6fb1905d4586a2fb823"}
