  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>Overall pretty easy hiking and down climbing, yet with a big sense of\nsteep drop along much of the distance. The technical sections are plenty\nchallenging and exciting enough to make it a \"Canyoneering Adventure\".\nSlightly higher flows naturally increase the difficulty and danger.</p>\n<p>This is not a large creek, but flows will be too high in the spring\nof most years.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>From Fresno, take highway 168 north to Prather. A couple miles past\nPrather turn north onto Auberry Road. In Auberry stay right on Auberry\nRd. at the Y by the school. A few miles up Auberry Rd. turn left onto\nJose Basin road. There is a big sign for the Mono Winds Casino. Stay on\nJose Basin Rd till you come to Italian Bar Road. Italian Bar Road leads\ndown to the take out on Million Dollar Mile Road. The starting point is\nwhere Jose Basin Road crosses the creek.</p>\n<p>The distance from Fresno is about 50 miles but allow an hour and 20\nminutes driving, at least. Jose Basin Road is paved, but narrow and very\ntwisty.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>From the parking area by the bridge, enter the creek under the\nbridge. DCR offers a quicker, dryer route to the technical section, but\nthere are some interesting potholes and a large dammed pool DCL just\ndownstream of the bridge. The easiest path meanders over the creek a few\ntimes, and a crack trending DCL offers and easy descent with about a\n6-ft drop at the bottom (an assist here is usually appreciated).</p>\n<p>Above the first major falls, as the canyon steepens, one can\ndownclimb much further DCR than on the DCL side, though it involves some\nmore exposure.</p>\n<h3 id=\"rap_1\">Rap 1</h3>\n<p>There are two options here:</p>\n<p><strong>DCR: Wet rappel.</strong> Two bolts with chain links are set\non top of a rounded granite slope. The drop from here to the last ledge\nof the falls (above a pool below) is 90 ft, with about 30 ft of free\nhang in the middle. It's recommended to disconnect from and pull rope\nfrom the DCL side of the creek to avoid slipping in the slick bottom of\nthe falls.</p>\n<p><strong>DCC: Wet rappels in slot.</strong> From a natural anchor just\nright of the flow, rappel into the slot, and continue down into the 2nd\nhalf of the slot past the ledge walk-off LDC. The rap ends near the end\nof the slot, where a 2nd anchor is set up on a chockstone. From here,\nrap out of the slot into the waterfall. These two rappels are only\nrecommended in low to moderate flow, for experienced canyoneers. The\nwater gets very pushy in the slot, and backpacks and rope bags are\ndifficult to manage. (It is possible that this rappel overlaps with wet\nrappel option #1 above; we did not see the bolted anchor). This is the\nmost technical, and the most fun, feature in the canyon. We found and\nreplaced a very old webbing anchor for the 2nd rap on Aug 5 2017.</p>\n<p><strong>DCL: Two dry raps in series</strong> to get down to the same\nlocation. A BFR is slung DCL of the top of the waterfall well out of the\nflow. The drop here is about 50? ft down to a ledge. From this ledge, a\ntree is slung much further DCL to cover the final distance of 70? ft to\nthe bottom of the waterfall. Both of these raps are down bushy cliffs\nbut are dry. The tree sling anchor is a bit exposed.</p>\n<p>Walk down large open granite slabs until you approach a larger\ndropoff.</p>\n<h3 id=\"rap_2\">Rap 2</h3>\n<p>Rap 2 was a rock-chock under a large round boulder canyon center\n(washed away in spring 2017). This goes into a slopey 30?-ft rap that\nends in the main flow of the creek. This rap is also easily bypassed by\ndownclimbing a wide flake somewhat DCR of the boulder/rap.</p>\n<p>From here the creek goes into a crack and down a series of short\nfalls. If the waterflow is low enough, the crack is fairly easily\ndownclimbed DCR of the falls and by crossing the falls just above the\nlast pool or continuing down the crack and out under the falls. There is\nan <strong>optional Rap 2.5</strong> off of a slung tree, reached by\nclimbing over all the cracks that slope into the stream (the tree top is\nvisible from the top of the cascade section). The optional rap is\npreferable in higher flow conditions where downclimbing by the stream\ninvolves more risk. This section can also be bypassed entirely by\nwalking wide DCR- a good option for weaker climbers. Continue below\nthese falls to a sizeable drop-off.</p>\n<h3 id=\"rap_3___dead_dog_falls\">Rap 3 - Dead Dog Falls</h3>\n<p><strong>Dead Dog Falls wet rap</strong> DCR of the main stream flow\nis a wide pool, with two bolts on top of the dry granite on the\ndownstream side (just above the cliff). In higher flows, a secondary\nwaterfall DCR will leave these bolts on a narrow island atop the cliff,\nwhich could become very dangerous. This rap of 150 ft enters the\nwaterfall and continues as a slide down the falls into a shallow pothole\nand then a very deep hole at the bottom of the falls.</p>\n<p><strong>Wet rap option #2</strong> Natural anchor on a boulder in the\nmiddle of the flow. This puts you more directly in the flow, and avoids\nusing the sketchy bolted anchor.</p>\n<p><strong>Dry rap</strong> A tree was slung well DCR of the falls, off\nthe granite slab. This shorter rap bypasses the water entirely and drops\ndown a grassy slope back into the granite canyon.</p>\n<h3 id=\"rap_4\">Rap 4</h3>\n<p><strong>Wet option</strong> a flake DCR (under a large rock outcrop)\nis slung to allow for a rap right down the waterfall and into the pool\nbelow (ending in a swimming disconnect). The flake is somewhat cracked\nand hollow sounding. The 2nd option below is advised.</p>\n<p><strong>Dry option</strong> a crack DCL of the next waterfall\ncontains a slung chockstone. The narrow crack could make for a difficult\npull.</p>\n<h3 id=\"rap_5___the_buttcrack\">Rap 5 - the Buttcrack</h3>\n<p>There's evidence of several anchor options here to get down the 40?\nft to the pool below. A <strong>large rounded boulder</strong> chocked\nabove the top of the waterfall has been slung in the past, but makes for\nan exposed clip-in point and very dangerous in higher flows. Above this\non the slope DCL are <strong>two bolts</strong> with SS hangers, which\nmake for a much safer clip-in point, but a potentially trickier rappel.\nFinally, a pair of redundant <strong>knot-chocks</strong> in a crack\nhigher, and further downstream DCL of the crack/falls offers another\noption to avoid the falls altogether. This less desirable anchor\ncertainly makes for a safer rappel in significant flows. All raps result\nin a swimming disconnect- exit the pool DCR.</p>\n<h3 id=\"rap_6\">Rap 6</h3>\n<p>This final drop of 70 ft into another pool is a slide straight down\nthe waterfall. A convenient <strong>underwater rock jughandle</strong>\njust atop the falls makes for a great anchor in a surprising place,\nthough it's practically impossible to find (certainly impossible to\nexpect) in more than low flow. The water flow makes for a very hard pull\nif doubled. This is a good spot for a retrievable anchor.</p>\n<p>A <strong>dry option</strong> is also rigged here: a slung flake in a\ncrack DCR, a few feet above the pool level.</p>\n<p>This final rap can also be bypassed by climbing down the rock face\nDCL of the falls.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>After the technical section, a large pool presents one last\nopportunity for a short jump and a swim. The hike out is\nstraightforward, along gently sloping streambed alternating between\nwide, smooth granite slabs and rocky sections. About halfway down, <a\nhref=\"Mill_Creek_(Lower,_Sierra_National_Forest)\" title=\"wikilink\">Mill\nCreek</a> flows into Jose Creek.</p>\n<p>Once you spot the bridge, there's a trail DCR that goes up to the\nroad (Million Dollar Rd). Follow the road to the right for about 400\nyds; the exit vehicles are on the other side of the gate.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<p>Canyon is inside burn area of 2020 Creek Fire.

Basin Road to Million Dollar Mile Road.</p>\n<p>Jerry, Randy, Bill and I did this three weeks ago with a very\npleasant water flow.  Most years this flow will probably occur much\nearlier in the summer.   We started down at 10:40 AM and got to the take\nout at 4:15 with a half hour stop for lunch.   I expect most groups will\ntake a bit longer.   Water temperature was very pleasant and we did not\nneed or use wetsuits.   Only a couple pools were deep enough that we\nswam, but we did do lots of wading.</p>\n<p>We found this creek very fun and interesting.    It seemed like a\npretty easy canyon with mostly easy travel, but there were two steep\nsections where we rappelled.   The most unique and interesting  features\nwere two spots where the water drops through steep chimney sluices.   We\nbypassed the first of these crevasses, but shouldn't have.  Stay in the\nslots for the most fun if it is safe to do so.   Use chock stones for\nanchors.    In my mind, the vertical slots were the most fun and unique\naspects of the trip.   The second steep starts off with a big rappel\ndown a face next to and in the water fall.   Dead Dog Falls.   Yeah,\ngoing off a 140 foot cliff onto a slab did him in.   Below this, it got\nnarrow and we finished down a cool crevasse into a deep pool.</p>\n<p>From the Jose Basin Road to the Million Dollar Mile Road, the creek\ndrops around 900 feet in 8/10 of a mile.   We did about 5 or 6 rappels\nand one of them was around 150 feet.   I slung chockstones for most of\nthe rappel anchors.  At our first rappel, I drilled bolts, but if you\nstay in the slot you won't see or need the bolts. If the flow is a bit\nhigh, then you will prefer using the bolts to the side of the main\nflow.</p>\n<p>We all thought Jose Creek was a very good canyon trip.   Overall it\nwas pretty easy hiking and down climbing , yet with a  big sense of\nsteep drop along much of the distance.    The two steep sections with\nrappels were plenty challenging and exciting enough to make this a\n\"Canyoneering Adventure\" and not just a creek hike.    I think this will\nbecome popular as a relatively easy but very fun canyon in this\narea.</p>\n<h3 id=\"lower_jose_creek\">Lower Jose Creek</h3>\n<p>Million Dollar Mile Road to Reddinger Lake.</p>\n<p>Tim Schiller and I hiked the lower part of Jose Creek down to the\npowerhouse, then walked back up the road to my car.   The water is\nsignificantly less than 3 weeks ago.   There is a popular swimming hole\njust down from the start, so there is a lot of trash.     The lower\nsection is about 300 feet less steep than the upper section.      It\ndrops 600 feet in about 8/10 of a mile from the Million Dollar Mile Road\nto the powerhouse at Reddinger Lake.</p>\n<p>The lower section is fairly easy hiking and down climbing for the\nmost part.  It is certainly easier than the upper section and I thought\nless interesting.   There are about 3 steep sections which require down\nclimbing or rappelling.    I think the highest rappels that one might\ndo, were in the 50 to 60 foot range.     We just down climbed, but there\nwere several spots where it would be fun to rappel.</p>\n<p>The first major steep is just at the beginning.   A big and popular\nswimming hole is at the base.  There is an easy walk around to the\nright, which bypasses the pool.    There are a couple of very high spots\nfrom which people jump into the pool.   A very interesting option would\nbe to rappel down the waterfall itself through a notch.   There are\nchock stones and such that would serve as anchors.</p>\n<p>The second big drop off was about half way.   It had a couple boulder\ny terraces with interesting/challenging down climbs.</p>\n<p>The last steep section  was very pretty.  The water split into\nseveral small cracks and dropped over the cliff at 3 different\nlocations.   We did an awkward down climb on the left with the aid of a\nhandline around a bush.    The face near the waterfalls seemed like a\nnice rappel location and there was potential for natural anchors at the\ntop.</p>\n<p>It took us about two hours to reach the bottom of the creek at a\nleisurely pace.   It took us about an hour to walk the 1.3 miles up the\nroad back to the start.  There is a high fence and electric gate several\nhundred yards up from the powerhouse.   If some one is coming or going,\nthey can let you out, otherwise you will have to find some way around,\nwhich could be difficult.    Might be best to investigate earlier.   \nAlternatively, I think it would be more fun to just hike back up the\ncreek.</p>\n<p>Overview:   This is a pretty creek with lots of bedrock.  Travel is\nfairly easy and is suitable for novice canyoneers.    Natural anchors\ncan be found at the three steep sections.   Skilled climbers can find\ndown climbs.    It appeared to be about as easy to hike up the canyon as\ndown.</p>\n<h2
