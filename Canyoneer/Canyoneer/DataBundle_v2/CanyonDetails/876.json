Water is available at the Colorado River. The hike down the Eminence Break is steep and rocky but well marked with cairns along the entire approach. The head of Tatahoysa will come into view after an hour or so of hiking to where the trail starts to level out a bit. The views are spectacular. Continue on as the trail becomes more defined and eventually crosses Tatahoysa drainage just a few yards up from the first rappel. The canyon was dry so no wetsuits were required.
