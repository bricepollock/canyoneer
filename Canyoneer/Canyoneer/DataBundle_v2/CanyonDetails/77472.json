class=\"mw-content-ltr mw-parser-output\" lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><p>Kalang Wet follows the river and waterfalls, with anchors placed to maximise interaction with the flow. The canyon is runnable in medium flow, although some of the anchors place the abseiler in the full force of the falling water. In medium and high flows, the descent is a relentless series of waterfalls that will give the more experienced canyoner a fun and challenging trip. In high flow there is always the opt-out option to take the dry line for any of the abseils, using the old anchors away from the river. Kalang provides a possible fallback option for the experienced aquatic canyoner when the water in Kanangra Main and Danae Brook is too high.\n<\/p><p>Wetsuits are recommend.\n<\/p><p>If you're looking for the dry line notes refer to the abseil list at the bottom of the descent section below, and <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https:\/\/ozultimate.com\/canyoning\/track_notes\/kalang.htm\">OZultimate's Kalang Falls track notes<\/a>\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading3\"><h3 id=\"Water_Levels\">Water Levels<\/h3><\/div>\n<ul><li>The catchment is ~4 km&#178;<\/li><\/ul>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading4\"><h4 id=\"River_gauges\">River gauges<\/h4><\/div>\n<ul><li>212260 Kowmung @ Cedar Ford <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https:\/\/waterinsights.waternsw.com.au\/m\/site\/212260\">Mobile<\/a> (hint: turn phone sideways),  <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https:\/\/waterinsights.waternsw.com.au\/12964-sydney-drinking-water-catchment\/river-data#212260\">Desktop<\/a><\/li><\/ul>\n<p>Refer <a href=\"\/w\/index.php?title=Kanangra_Main&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Kanangra Main (page does not exist)\">Kanangra_Main<\/a> for gauge levels and grading.
