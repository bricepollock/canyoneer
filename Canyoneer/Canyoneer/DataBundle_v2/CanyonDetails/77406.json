Walk along the side track on the right of the railway line til you reach a clearing at the base of a low hill. (Approx 1.65kms from bridge) Then, head around the right of the hill or over the top and down the other side, aiming for the obvious feeder creek.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>After the entry abseil, there are 2 more abseils in the main canyon, including a fun one down a slot in the creek bed into a dark chamber with an amazing view downstream. Not long after this abseil, you turn a corner, and you have an opportunity to do a fun 3mtr jump, or, a slippery hand-over hand into a deep, cold pool.\n<\/p><p>There are 2 cold swims, one after the 2nd abseil and the final jump pool, both are very deep, dark and cold.\n<\/p><p>Sadly, the canyon is over all too quickly.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Follow the creek downstream to the old Colliery, then follow the old road (What's left of it) back to your car.
