Be aware:  unlike other parts of the country, canyoning is not widely known or recognized in the Pacific NW.  Individuals climbing, rappelling, or slack-lining around such \"show waterfalls\" are far more likely to garner negative reactions from the general public at large. Negative reactions can lead to complaints and more rules by the local authorities.  If you must descend this creek, locals suggest descending when the number of hikers will be low - e.g. early in the morning or on weekdays.  Please be scrupulous about following a Leave-No-Trace ethic.  Leaving brightly colored anchors can annoy waterfall photographers, irk land managers, and may encourage the inexperienced \/ unprepared to attempt to follow you.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Beta_sites\">Beta sites<\/h2><\/div>\n<ul><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20210527212206\/www.canyoneeringnorthwest.com\/ColumbiaRiver\/Columbia_River_Gorge_Prospects.php\">CanyoneeringNorthwest.com (archive.org)<\/a> &#160;: Columbia River Gorge Prospects<\/li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http:\/\/ropewiki.com\/User:Super_Amazing_Map?id=Latourell_Creek_-_Oregon\">Super Amazing Map<\/a> &#160;: Latourell Creek<\/li><\/ul>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Background\">Background<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Michelle saw an article about this majestic waterfall while in the checkout lane in a local supermarket with Tiffanie, that triggered our interest to go check it out.\n<\/p>\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nParsed by mw‐api‐ext.codfw.main‐6779cc57fc‐65c7h\nCached time: 20240914192116\nCache expiry: 2592000\nReduced expiry: false\nComplications: [show‐toc]\nCPU time usage: 0.005 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.006 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 21\/1000000\nPost‐expand include size: 0\/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 0\/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 2\/100\nExpensive parser function count: 0\/500\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0\/20\nUnstrip post‐expand size: 0\/5000000 bytes\nNumber of Wikibase entities loaded: 0\/400\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%    0.000      1 -total\n-->\n<\/div>","shuttleSeconds":null,"technicalRating":3,"rappelCountMin":1,"vehicle":"Passenger","timeRating":"I","quality":3,"months":["Jul","Aug","Sep"],"waterRating":"C"}
