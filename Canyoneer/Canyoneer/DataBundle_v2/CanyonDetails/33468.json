If you don't have time to do the upper section, the lower section by itself is nonetheless a superb quick route. A 50 foot simul-rappel off an arch, a 30 foot high rope swing, followed by 2 large jumps into deep and wide pools, and 2 small jumps ending with a picturesque downclimb. Due to the very long drive out on Hana Highway, it is recommended to do the full route, otherwise you may spend more time in the car than in canyon.\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Drive Hana Highway (360) east, park in the small turn-off on the right (SW) side of the road at 20.811012, -156.114658.

On canyon right can be jumped but must get out far to avoid an underwater ledge.  \n<\/p><p>R2 - The rope swing is on a deep ledge on the left which requires rappelling down 20 feet to get to. People have jumped from the upper tier above the rope swing ledge for a roughly 50 foot jump. \n<\/p><p>R3 - Bolts right. Can be jumped for a 35 foot jump. \n<\/p><p>R4 - An area where the drainage produces a large island in the middle. The tendency is to head right and downclimb, but the middle promontory has a jumping opportunity from a perch 35 feet high. You jump somewhat over and next to a flowering tree.\n<\/p><p>R5 - A roughly 90 foot rappel. \n<\/p><p>A couple small jumps about 10 feet are encountered before reaching the final downclimb to the bridge.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>After the final rappel, visable from Hana Hwy, enter your shuttle vehicle, or walk about a 1\/2 mile west back to your TH vehicle.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Red_tape\">Red tape<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>The above noted parking spot at the \"trailhead\" is very small, be sure to park in such a manner as not to block access to the gate.
