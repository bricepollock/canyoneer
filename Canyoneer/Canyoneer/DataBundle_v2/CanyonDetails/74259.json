When you get to the intersection of Bangalore and Urumbilum rivers - do not try to down climb in the river (this section should be bolted) - instead bash through the bush on TR to get around vertical section. Then creek walk all the way down the river - watch out for snakes. You will eventually get to a picnic area (marked as a ford on the map) and then can follow Jersey Bull Road back to the bottom car.\n<\/p><p><b>One-car trip returning to top:<\/b> After exiting the large, deep pool of the final abseil, the creekwalk turns sharply left before continuing straight for 100m. Exit on the ridgeline CL at a grove of palm trees, shortly before the creek makes a second left-hand turn.\nWalk directly uphill until meeting a snig track on top of the ridge. Follow this to the top of the hill (marked \"475m\" on the map), occasionally exiting the snig track to avoid dead trees or debris.\nFrom the top of the hill, follow the overgrown Bangalore Rd Firetrail for approximately 1.6km. Shortly after passing a massive tree blocking the path, the road takes a sharp right turn. Walk left up the embankment, skirting to the left side of a large smooth slab visible from the road. Follow the saddle uphill - several snig trails make passage easier. Locate the small, unmarked rocky creek flowing down the gully on the other side of the saddle, and follow this to where it crosses Urumbilum Creek Rd. Ensure you choose the correct direction  - left or right -  on Urumbilum Creek Rd to locate your parked car.\n<\/p><p>Another option is to go up the steep ridge at the junction of Bangalore and Urumbilum creeks.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Red_tape\">Red tape<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Beta_sites\">Beta sites<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media<\/h2><\/div>\n<ul><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https:\/\/sleepwhenwearedead.net\/2024\/01\/02\/urumbilum\/\">Urumbilum 30\/12\/23 SLEEPWHENWEAREDEAD<\/a><\/li><\/ul>\n<ul><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/QmVXuQ1hLtc\">YouTube.com<\/a>&#160;: Craving Karst, Urumbilum Canyon, December 2022<\/li><\/ul>\n<p><br \/>\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Background\">Background<\/h2><\/div>\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nParsed by mw‐api‐ext.codfw.main‐6779cc57fc‐4kxdf\nCached time: 20240914191828\nCache expiry: 2592000\nReduced expiry: false\nComplications: [show‐toc]\nCPU time usage: 0.010 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.011 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 24\/1000000\nPost‐expand include size: 0\/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 0\/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 2\/100\nExpensive parser function count: 0\/500\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0\/20\nUnstrip post‐expand size: 0\/5000000 bytes\nNumber of Wikibase entities loaded: 0\/400\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%    0.000      1 -total\n-->\n<\/div>"}
