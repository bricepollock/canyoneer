The canyon walls are 5 or\n6 times taller than the creek is wide.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>Follow the ridge down into the creek, passing a few minor cliffs,\nmostly taken direct.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>About 50m back from the Bowens junction, you can exit on the true\nright up ledges to a steep dirt ridge, which unfortunately sends you in\nthe wrong direction. Bash up this for a while, then contour and descend\nback to the head of the canyon, then retrace your approach route.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n",
