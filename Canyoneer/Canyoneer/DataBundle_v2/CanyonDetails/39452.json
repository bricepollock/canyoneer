You'll see <b>R1\/J1<\/b> while crossing.\n<\/p><p>Alternatively, drive a shuttle vehicle to a meadow near the road and approach from canyon left. Rappel off a tree canyon left, and jump in above R1.

Optionally, instead of stopping at the small alcove, rappel down to a ledge about 3 feet above the surface wide enough to stand on, lock off, toss your pack over the bottom of the falls such that it gets carried away from the boil, and duck left under the falls and jump out into the pool. \n<link rel=\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\" href=\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1062633282\"> \n<\/p>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\">\n<div style=\"display:table;\">\n<div class=\"thumbcaption\" style=\"display:table-caption;caption-side:bottom;box-sizing:border-box;\">{{{caption}}} <\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p><b>R4: 60'<\/b> Tree, canyon left, 60' rappel, into shallow pool.

This boil is easily avoided by rappelling just 15 feet downstream at the constriction where the flow will push the canyoneer to the safe zone.
