It is possible to bypass this keeper by chimneying high to a wedged long (assuming it is present) and rappeling 40 feet off this log which will place you on the down-canyon side of the pothole.  This chimney is not too dificult but the penalty points are high.  This pothole\/chimney obstacle is what gives the canyon its R rating.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Red_tape\">Red tape<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Beta_sites\">Beta sites<\/h2><\/div>\n<ul><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http:\/\/roadtripryan.com\/go\/t\/utah\/san-rafael-swell\/north-fork-iron-wash\">RoadTripRyan.com<\/a> &#160;: North Fork of Iron Wash<\/li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http:\/\/climb-utah.com\/SRS\/iron.htm\">Climb-Utah.com<\/a> &#160;: Iron Wash - North Fork<\/li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http:\/\/ropewiki.com\/User:Super_Amazing_Map?id=North_Fork_of_Iron_Wash_-_San_Rafael_Swell\">Super Amazing Map<\/a> &#160;: North Fork of Iron Wash<\/li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http:\/\/roadtripryan.com\/go\/t\/utah\/san-rafael-swell\/iron-wash\">RoadTripRyan.com<\/a> &#160;: Iron Wash<\/li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http:\/\/canyoncollective.com\/betabase\/north-fork-of-iron-wash.405?kmlidxna\">CanyonCollective.com<\/a> &#160;: North Fork of Iron Wash<\/li><\/ul>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media<\/h2><\/div>\n<ul><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https:\/\/www.stavislost.com\/hikes\/trail\/north-fork-of-iron-wash\">Stav is Lost: May 20, 2023<\/a>&#160;: North Fork Iron Wash<\/li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http:\/\/candition.com\/canyons\/iron-wash\">Candition.com<\/a>&#160;: Iron Wash<\/li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external free\" href=\"http:\/\/amazingslots.blogspot.com\/2013\/06\/iron-maiden.html\">http:\/\/amazingslots.blogspot.com\/2013\/06\/iron-maiden.html<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/EeYYTHjGEl8\">YouTube.com<\/a>&#160;: Richard Pattison, North Fork of Iron Wash movie<\/li><\/ul>\n<p><br \/>\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Background\">Background<\/h2><\/div>\n\n\n<\/div>","technicalRating":3,"permit":"No","riskRating":"R","id":580,"longitude":-110.5282,"rappelCountMin":0}
