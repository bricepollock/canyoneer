  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>Olancha Creek is located on the east side of the Sierra. While like\nother east side canyons, it is a bit brushy, the bushwhacking is not bad\nat all, and several fun rappels and slides make the canyon well worth\nit.</p>\n<p>Anchors are mostly off of trees, except the large rappel, which is\nbolted DCL. The final rappel is short, but the trees for anchors are a\nbit on the smaller side.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>Turn west off of 395 onto Fall Rd in the small town of Olancha. Cross\nthe canal, and head right up a rocky road (do-able in a Subaru, probably\nnot anything less. You could park at the bottom and walk from here\nwithout adding too much effort though.) This road ends on a powerline\nroad. Turn right, and find parking on the left just before the road\ncrosses Olancha Creek. You can check the flows here too.</p>\n<p>If you look from here up at the canyon Olancha Creek flows out of,\ncoming up from the right you should see a redish colored area that is\nsignificantly less steep (sort of a shoulder on the hill side). This is\nwhere you will traverse in toward the canyon. Hike up the alluvial fan\ntoward the mountains, keeping an eye out for a good place to cross the\ncreek. Then at the base, climb steeply up until you hit the gentler\nslope at 6000ft elevation, crossing between some rocky outcrops.</p>\n<p>Traverse in toward the canyon over a tiny pass, and descend a steep,\nloose gully a good ways down to the creek.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>Heading downstream you soon encounter some bypassable waterfalls in\nthe first gorge. As the gorge narrows, you'll come to a low angled slide\nthat is somewhat trickier to avoid. This is a good spot to suit up,\nbecause this slide (in our experience) is good to go! The next drop can\nbe rappelled or downclimbed to the right.</p>\n<p>The first gorge ends, and you will have to walk for a good ways. A\nsmall path up through some sage brush takes you around the thick\nwillows. Soon you'll come to a series of three rappels. The first is\nsimple. The second rappel which seemed specifically designed to smash\nyou with the entire flow, has been bolted down canyon left, at a spot\nwhich will allow you to avoid the majority of the flow if you desire.\nThe third rappel, you will need to cross the flow (start down canyon\nleft, down to a ledge, press yourself against the wall as much as\npossible, and step/swing to your right/down canyon left, then rappel\non).</p>\n<p>Soon after these rappels, the canyon enters a short slot. A careful\nrappel from the right side of the canyon keeps you out of a crevice down\nto the left. This can be anchored from small willows, or from some rocks\nway up above you past a large boulder. The second drop you can see\nexiting this slot is a potential slide, but as of May 2021, is filled in\nwith sand.</p>\n<p>Downstream from here after working your way through some willows,\nyou'll come to the final drop. The water used to be ~7-8 feet deep,\nproviding a very fun slide. As of May 2021, it is also filled in with\nsand.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>Just below this slide you will be out of the canyon. Exit the creek\nto the right, and hike back down to your car.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<p><a\nhref=\"https://youtu.be/9cSRiqZVYek\">https://youtu.be/9cSRiqZVYek</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n",
