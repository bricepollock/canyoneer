  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p><strong>Location:</strong></p>\n<p>North of Yea, in the Strathbogie ranges</p>\n<p><strong>Character:</strong></p>\n<p>One short slot with two abseils and multiple downclimbs</p>\n<p><strong>Water:</strong></p>\n<p>Ephemeral, with tiny catchment, only worth going if it’s recently\nrained (20mm in last week).</p>\n<p><strong>Catchment:</strong></p>\n<p>1km2</p>\n<p><strong>Anchors:</strong></p>\n<p>Mix of trees and nuts</p>\n<p><strong>Gear:</strong></p>\n<p>Minimum 20m of rope, and a rack of nuts for back-up.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p><strong>Approach by car:</strong></p>\n<p>Follow your preferred phone/GPS/Melways map to the intersection of\nHighlands road and Chisholm’s Road, then follow the road south for 1.6km\nturning right at the first intersection. Pass though two gates and\nyou’ll reach the entrance to the Switzerland Range Nature Conservation\nReserve. Turn right and follow the track for 900m, parking where the\nroad turns south on the knoll.</p>\n<p><strong>Approach on Foot:</strong></p>\n<p>Follow the spur south until you reach the creek. </p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>While most of the route is fairly open, the gorge constricts around\nR3-5. Several rappels may be avoided by downclimbing, keeping in mind\nthat the sandstone is very slippery when wet. R5 is a single nut (BD#1)\nanchor, and should be backed up with other trad gear in the cracks in\nthe right hand side. You may consider setting up a belay for the\napproach as a slip would be rather harmful. Exit after the last\nwaterfall by heading up the spur on the right. </p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p><strong>Flash flood danger:</strong></p>\n<p>Very low. Needs large amounts of rain to flood, and refuges to await\nlower water levels (or attempt to climb out) abound.</p>\n<p><strong>Escapes:</strong></p>\n<p>Most of the way down, there will be possibilities of escape on the\nright side. At times this may involve scrub or uncomfortable\nexposure.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n"
