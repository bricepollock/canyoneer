  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>An uninspiring canyon, but not particularly unpleasant if you're\nlooking for a nice hike in the Santa Rosas.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>Hike up a steep hill, boulder hop across some rocky benches, across a\nsmall field or two with small interesting features. Cross over a wash up\nto a saddle, then traverse around to the right drainage.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>The first descent party deviated around a couple 4ft rappels. They\ndidn't seem worth building a rock cairns.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>R1</strong> 160' from cairn anchor canyon center</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Many low-angle downclimbs exist above and below R1.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>The canyon geology encourages the creation of small 1-4 foot deep\nshelter holes. Some, 50-100ft up the canyon wall during the exit hike\nseem interesting, but also potentially difficult to access. The first\ndescent party poked their heads into many of the caves at canyon-level\nand didn't find anything worth noting.</p>\n<p>The canyon gradually widens. Exit the canyon mouth and walk back\nacross the alluvium to your vehicle.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n<p>First explored by David Angel and Morgan Diefenbach on February 2,\n2020.</p>\n"
