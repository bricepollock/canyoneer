  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>Micro Stafford is a tiny spring fed creek about 100 yards NE of\nStafford Creek. It's not a major adventure objective but can give you a\ncouple of nice rappels when everything else is running high. The first\nand last rappels are nice with the middle of the creek being low\nangle/down climbable.</p>\n<p>Though it's never going to be a classic, an easy shuttle, an easy\napproach and a beautiful spring coming right out of the rock at the\nfirst rappel make this worth a visit if you happen to be in the\narea.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>Park at a nice campsite just a little bit past the drop in for\nStafford. Follow the obvious ridge south from here through a small slash\npile then on nice elk trails. You'll drop through a steeper area onto a\nbench/road cut. Head toward the obvious cliff band ahead of you. It\nwould be a good idea to use the waypoints provided since we had to\nexplore a while before we found the creek.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>At the beginning of the descent the water literally comes pouring out\nof the cliff face. It creates a beautiful oasis and well worn elk trails\nindicate that it may run well into the dry season.</p>\n<p>R1: 100 feet from an obvious large tree DCR. This is a rappel through\na nice moss garden with a few high angle sections. There are a few trees\nto avoid on the way down. Bear creek left to stay in the flow but drop\nyour pull rope to the dry area to the right for an easy pull. End on a\nloose but safe bench.</p>\n<p>R2: 50 feet from a tree DCL. Low angle rappel that ends above a snarl\nof logs, branches and brush.</p>\n<p>Downclimb DCL about 50 feet back to the creek bed.</p>\n<p>R3: 60 feet from a tree DCL. Low angle and brushy. Most of this\nsection can be downclimbed, but there are a couple of short vertical\nsteps that may be easier on a rope. A double stand or tree wrap set up\nmay be best here so as to make the pull easier.</p>\n<p>R4: 45 feet from a tree DCR. This is a lovely drop directly into the\nDevil's Fork of the Wilson River. Very vertical and easy to stay in the\nflow for a fun finish.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>Cross the Devil's Fork of the Wilson River to an old road grade.\nAscend to Highway 6 at any point. Walking down creek to the low angle\nexit immediately across from Macro Stafford Creek is an easy option.\nRoad walk back to the Drift Creek Day Use Area then shuttle back up to\nyour start car.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<p>None</p>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n<p>This tiny creeklet is easily seen from Highway 6 and may have been\nnoticed by a few canyoneers going to run its (much) bigger sibling about\n100 yards south. First descended by Kevin Clark, Ashley Driscoll and\nTrey Schutrumpf in early 2024.</p>\n",
