  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>A stunning tuff canyon with a big free-hanging rappel into a vast\nchamber-like chasm. amazing hallways and short slot sections follow this\nbefore a tough but short scramble out. The PG rating is for all the\nloose material on the exit.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>drop into side drainage from parking spot (might be better parking\nfurther south on this road but would have to either backtrack or drop in\nfurther downcanyon) and follow this till it hits scimitar. topo around\nto the left until you can drop into the main canyon. bushwhacking\nthrough annoying gooseberry unavoidable.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>R1: 30' tree canyon center</p>\n<p>R2: 30' multi-stemmed bush RDC</p>\n<p>R3: 160' robust cairn</p>\n<p>R4: 30' multi-stemmed bush LDC</p>\n<p>R5: 25' cairn</p>\n<p>R6: 10' pinch point at edge (hard start)</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>carefully work your way through more ornery gooseberry, staying in\nthe center of the drainage. leave the drainage where indicated on the\nkml and work your way up the slope RDC, avoiding looser sections and\nsequencing your team in the sketchier sections. Some class 4 scrambling\nwill get you up the more vertical upper tuff bands if you choose the\nright spots to ascend.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<p><a\nhref=\"http://www.dougscottart.com/hobbies/SlotCanyons/Scimitar.htm\">http://www.dougscottart.com/hobbies/SlotCanyons/Scimitar.htm</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n<p>First (Known) Descent, in May 2019, by Kevin Childress, Jake\nFreimanis, and Ben Chesebrough, involved a carefully balanced three\nboulder cairn anchor above the 160ft rap, and a well balanced backpack\nanchor for the final raps. Subsequent visits have increased anchor\nquality substantially to the level of \"marginally acceptable\" (Read:\nBetter than a tumble weed).</p>\n",
