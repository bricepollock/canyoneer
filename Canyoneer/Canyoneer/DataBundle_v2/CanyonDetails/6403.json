It has big water, big falls, and has yet to be fully explored.\nIn the heart of the canyon there are at least three substantial falls\nand possibly more. The highest is 125 feet and is called Service Falls.\nOnly a handful of people have ever seen it without flying over in a\nplane. No one has descended it. Queets Canyon should be attempted only\nby canyoneers with extensive swift water experience and who are\nequipped, both mentally and physically, to deal with advanced canyoning\nchallenges in a remote wilderness. Queets Canyon is located near the\nhead of the Queets River in one of the most remote places in the Olympic\nMountains. The watershed at the canyon is not especially large, but it\ncontains several glaciers so water flow is substantial. The best time to\nfind low water would be in September after the winter snow has melted\nand the cooler temperatures have slowed glacial melting. Any one\nattempting this remote and difficult canyon should plan on being out at\nleast a week and possibly much longer. In 1992 a group of kayakers\ndescended the river. They left the river and detoured around the hardest\npart of the canyon and most of the falls. A brief account of their trip\nis included below. More recently Mike MacFerrin has made three lengthy\nsolo trips up river into the canyon in hope of reaching and\nphotographing Service Falls. He succeeded on his third attempt in 2008.\nPhotos and fascinating accounts of Mike�s arduous treks into the canyon\ncan be found on his website at www.rainforesttreks.com It is highly\nrecommended that people planning a trip into this area read Mike�s\naccounts in order to fully understand the challenges of travel in this\narea.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>To descend the canyon you will need to get to the headwaters of the\nriver at Queets Basin. There are several ways of doing this. By any\nroute it is a long hike that will take two days and possibly more. One\nroute is to hike the Elwha River trail to Elwha Basin. Climb northwest\nto Dodwell Rixon Pass and descend to Queets Basin. A shorter route is to\nhike the trail up the North Fork of the Quinalt River. Follow the trail\nover Low Divide, join the Elwha River trail , and continue as above.\nOnce in Queets Basin, follow the river downstream for about two miles to\nthe canyon.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>Undescended; a group of kayakers have descended it in 1992, bypassed\nthe hardest section.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>The canyon is about a mile long. Once through the canyon (assuming\nthat you make it) you have two choices for your return route. You can\nleave the river, ascend slopes on its west, and make a difficult\ntraverse high above the canyon and return to the river above the canyon.\nThis would enable you to return the same way you came. Read Mike�s\naccount for an idea of what that is like. An easier option is to follow\nthe Queets River downstream. Allow at least three days to reach the\nroad.</p>\n<p>Maps: USGS Mount Queets, Mount Olympus The following photos were\nprovided by Mike MacFerrin.

When I asked\nlocal waterfall expert Bryan Swan about it recently, he said, \"I\nhonestly don't think anyone has seen it from the ground level.\"</p>\n<p>Swan and I had heard the story of Mike MacFerrin, an avid hiker from\nColorado and former Northwest resident, who had spent days in 2004 and\nagain in 2005 trying to reach Service Falls by scrambling miles upstream\nbeyond the end of the Queets River Trail. Despite enduring some\nharrowing off-trail adventures, he never reached it. He is planning\nanother attempt, with climbing gear, this summer (see\nrainforesttreks.com).</p>\n<p>However, at least three people have seen it from the ground level,\nreaching it in 1992 by using whitewater kayaks and climbing gear and\nbackpacking at least 30 miles, much of it through rugged, high,\noff-trail terrain. This little-known adventure was chronicled back then\nin a story written by my friend Bryn Beorse, then a reporter for The\nDaily World in Aberdeen.</p>\n<p>Intrigued while working on the main waterfall story for this issue, I\nobtained a clipping from Beorse of his story and then tracked down one\nof the guys who reached the falls -- Sprague Ackley, a well-known\nSeattle kayaker.</p>\n<p>\"We got to the base of it, and as far as I know, judging by how hard\nthat was and how we had to use kayaks, I don't know if anyone else has\nbeen there,\" he told me.</p>\n<p>Ackley says there actually are three major falls in the deep,\ntwo-mile-long canyon on the upper Queets, about 10 miles upstream from\nthe end of the Queets River Trail in Olympic National Park.</p>\n<p>Ackley was not searching out waterfalls when he reached these falls,\nbut rather was on a quest to kayak all the major rivers of the\npeninsula.</p>\n<p>The fascinating story vividly illustrates how remote some waterfalls\nin Washington are. Ackley and friends Eric Volk and Scott Mathews\nreached the Service Falls canyon from above, from the upstream side,\nbackpacking in from the north, via the Elwha River Trail, which begins\nwest of Port Angeles.</p>\n<p>Recently he showed me slides that document this incredible, nine-day\njourney.</p>\n<p>Dragging their light kayaks with shoulder slings and carrying ropes\nand other climbing gear, drysuits, a tarp, sleeping bags and 10 days\nworth of food, the trio left the trail more than 20 miles in and\nscrambled up over remote Dodwell-Rixon Pass, which separates the Queets\nand Elwha drainages. They then scrambled down to the Queets Basin and\nlaunched their kayaks at where Humes Creek joins the Queets, well above\nService Falls. From there they paddled downstream into the two-mile long\ncanyon structure that encloses Service Falls and the other two.</p>\n<p>The first falls they reached, likely Upper Service Falls, was in a\npart of the canyon they began referring to as the \"the dark place.\" It\nwas so steep and inhospitable they determined it could not be run and\nthey would have to climb out of the canyon before re-entering it well\ndownstream.</p>\n<p>\"Below, it was totally inaccessible. There was no way we could even\nrappel it,\" he says. \"We had to whack out to the rim. We hauled our\nboats out, up three pitches.\"</p>\n<p>The next day the trio descended into the canyon well downstream of\nthe middle falls, which Ackley today believes was Service Falls proper.\nFrom there, they headed upstream in an effort to run as much of the\nriver as possible.</p>\n<p>\"We had to work our way up this almost vertical canyon,\" he says. \"We\nwould drag our boats -- where there were places we could drag them --\nthen kayak upstream, dodging between rocks like a salmon would. We would\nget back out and drag them where we could, sometimes switching sides of\nthe river.\"</p>\n<p>They reached the base of Service Falls on the morning of Aug. 29 --\nmaybe the only people ever to get there. Ackley says the falls drops\nvertically at least 120 feet into a round pool. Upper Service Falls is\nabout the same height, he says. The trio rappelled the cliffs of a\nsmaller but still serious falls on the downstream end of the canyon.</p>\n<p>However, Ackley says the three falls in that canyon on the Queets are\nnot the most remote falls he knows off, or has been to.</p>\n<p>\"The most isolated and spectacular falls I recall running into is the\nfalls on the Ice River, which runs off Mount Olympus, from one of the\nnorth-facing glaciers. It drops into the middle canyon of the Hoh\n(River). Of all the places in the park I've been to, which is pretty\nmuch all the rivers, that was the one we all agreed was the most\ninaccessible place, the least likely place any human has ever been.\"</p>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n<p>Might be a good starting place <a\nhref=\"https://www.seattlepi.com/news/article/Remote-doesn-t-begin-to-describe-Service-Falls-1276811.php\">https://www.seattlepi.com/news/article/Remote-doesn-t-begin-to-describe-Service-Falls-1276811.php</a></p>\n"
