It has big water, big falls, and has yet to be fully explored. In the heart of the canyon there are at least three substantial falls and possibly more. The highest is 125 feet and is called Service Falls. Only a handful of people have ever seen it without flying over in a plane. No one has descended it. Queets Canyon should be attempted only by canyoneers with extensive swift water experience and who are equipped, both mentally and physically, to deal with advanced canyoning challenges in a remote wilderness.\nQueets Canyon is located near the head of the Queets River in one of the most remote places in the Olympic Mountains. The watershed at the canyon is not especially large, but it contains several glaciers so water flow is substantial. The best time to find low water would be in September after the winter snow has melted and the cooler temperatures have slowed glacial melting. Any one attempting this remote and difficult canyon should plan on being out at least a week and possibly much longer.\nIn 1992 a group of kayakers descended the river. They left the river and detoured around the hardest part of the canyon and most of the falls. A brief account of their trip is included below. More recently Mike MacFerrin has made three lengthy solo trips up river into the canyon in hope of reaching and photographing Service Falls. He succeeded on his third attempt in 2008. Photos and fascinating accounts of Mike�s arduous treks into the canyon can be found on his website at www.rainforesttreks.com It is highly recommended that people planning a trip into this area read Mike�s accounts in order to fully understand the challenges of travel in this area.\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>To descend the canyon you will need to get to the headwaters of the river at Queets Basin. There are several ways of doing this. By any route it is a long hike that will take two days and possibly more. One route is to hike the Elwha River trail to Elwha Basin. Climb northwest to Dodwell Rixon Pass and descend to Queets Basin. A shorter route is to hike the trail up the North Fork of the Quinalt River. Follow the trail over Low Divide, join the Elwha River trail , and continue as above. Once in Queets Basin, follow the river downstream for about two miles to the canyon.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Undescended; a group of kayakers have descended it in 1992, bypassed the hardest section.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>The canyon is about a mile long. Once through the canyon (assuming that you make it) you have two choices for your return route. You can leave the river, ascend slopes on its west, and make a difficult traverse high above the canyon and return to the river above the canyon. This would enable you to return the same way you came. Read Mike�s account for an idea of what that is like. An easier option is to follow the Queets River downstream. Allow at least three days to reach the road.\n<\/p><p>Maps: USGS Mount Queets, Mount Olympus\nThe following photos were provided by Mike MacFerrin.

When I asked local waterfall expert Bryan Swan about it recently, he said, \"I honestly don't think anyone has seen it from the ground level.\"\n<\/p><p>Swan and I had heard the story of Mike MacFerrin, an avid hiker from Colorado and former Northwest resident, who had spent days in 2004 and again in 2005 trying to reach Service Falls by scrambling miles upstream beyond the end of the Queets River Trail. Despite enduring some harrowing off-trail adventures, he never reached it. He is planning another attempt, with climbing gear, this summer (see rainforesttreks.com).\n<\/p><p>However, at least three people have seen it from the ground level, reaching it in 1992 by using whitewater kayaks and climbing gear and backpacking at least 30 miles, much of it through rugged, high, off-trail terrain. This little-known adventure was chronicled back then in a story written by my friend Bryn Beorse, then\n<\/p>\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nParsed by mw‐api‐ext.codfw.main‐6779cc57fc‐2hmnl\nCached time: 20240914191907\nCache expiry: 2592000\nReduced expiry: false\nComplications: [show‐toc]\nCPU time usage: 0.006 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.007 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 18\/1000000\nPost‐expand include size: 0\/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 0\/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 2\/100\nExpensive parser function count: 0\/500\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0\/20\nUnstrip post‐expand size: 0\/5000000 bytes\nNumber of Wikibase entities loaded: 0\/400\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%    0.000      1 -total\n-->\n<\/div><div class=\"mw-content-ltr mw-parser-output\" lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><pre>a reporter for The Daily World in Aberdeen.\n<\/pre>\n<p>Intrigued while working on the main waterfall story for this issue, I obtained a clipping from Beorse of his story and then tracked down one of the guys who reached the falls -- Sprague Ackley, a well-known Seattle kayaker.\n<\/p><p>\"We got to the base of it, and as far as I know, judging by how hard that was and how we had to use kayaks, I don't know if anyone else has been there,\" he told me.\n<\/p><p>Ackley says there actually are three major falls in the deep, two-mile-long canyon on the upper Queets, about 10 miles upstream from the end of the Queets River Trail in Olympic National Park.\n<\/p><p>Ackley was not searching out waterfalls when he reached these falls, but rather was on a quest to kayak all the major rivers of the peninsula.\n<\/p><p>The fascinating story vividly illustrates how remote some waterfalls in Washington are. Ackley and friends Eric Volk and Scott Mathews reached the Service Falls canyon from above, from the upstream side, backpacking in from the north, via the Elwha River Trail, which begins west of Port Angeles.\n<\/p><p>Recently he showed me slides that document this incredible, nine-day journey.\n<\/p><p>Dragging their light kayaks with shoulder slings and carrying ropes and other climbing gear, drysuits, a tarp, sleeping bags and 10 days worth of food, the trio left the trail more than 20 miles in and scrambled up over remote Dodwell-Rixon Pass, which separates the Queets and Elwha drainages. They then scrambled down to the Queets Basin and launched their kayaks at where Humes Creek joins the Queets, well above Service Falls. From there they paddled downstream into the two-mile long canyon structure that encloses Service Falls and the other two.\n<\/p><p>The first falls they reached, likely Upper Service Falls, was in a part of the canyon they began referring to as the \"the dark place.\" It was so steep and inhospitable they determined it could not be run and they would have to climb out of the canyon before re-entering it well downstream.\n<\/p><p>\"Below, it was totally inaccessible. There was no way we could even rappel it,\" he says. \"We had to whack out to the rim. We hauled our boats out, up three pitches.\"\n<\/p><p>The next day the trio descended into the canyon well downstream of the middle falls, which Ackley today believes was Service Falls proper. From there, they headed upstream in an effort to run as much of the river as possible.\n<\/p><p>\"We had to work our way up this almost vertical canyon,\" he says. \"We would drag our boats -- where there were places we could drag them -- then kayak upstream, dodging between rocks like a salmon would. We would get back out and drag them where we could, sometimes switching sides of the river.\"\n<\/p><p>They reached the base of Service Falls on the morning of Aug. 29 -- maybe the only people ever to get there. Ackley says the falls drops vertically at least 120 feet into a round pool. Upper Service Falls is about the same height, he says. The trio rappelled the cliffs of a smaller but still serious falls on the downstream end of the canyon.\n<\/p><p>However, Ackley says the three falls in that canyon on the Queets are not the most remote falls he knows off, or has been to.\n<\/p><p>\"The most isolated and spectacular falls I recall running into is the falls on the Ice River, which runs off Mount Olympus, from one of the north-facing glaciers. It drops into the middle canyon of the Hoh (River). Of all the places in the park I've been to, which is pretty much all the rivers, that was the one we all agreed was the most inaccessible place, the least likely place any human has ever been.\"\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Background\">Background<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Might be a good starting place\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external free\" href=\"https:\/\/www.seattlepi.com\/news\/article\/Remote-doesn-t-begin-to-describe-Service-Falls-1276811.php\">https:\/\/www.seattlepi.com\/news\/article\/Remote-doesn-t-begin-to-describe-Service-Falls-1276811.php<\/a>\n<\/p>\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nParsed by mw‐api‐ext.codfw.main‐6779cc57fc‐r7p7h\nCached time: 20240914191907\nCache expiry: 2592000\nReduced expiry: false\nComplications: []\nCPU time usage: 0.004 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.005 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 3\/1000000\nPost‐expand include size: 0\/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 0\/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 2\/100\nExpensive parser function count: 0\/500\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0\/20\nUnstrip post‐expand size: 0\/5000000 bytes\nNumber of Wikibase entities loaded: 0\/400\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%    0.000      1 -total\n-->\n<\/div>","vehicle":null}
