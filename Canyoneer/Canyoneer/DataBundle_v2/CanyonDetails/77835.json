It is a sequence of demanding abseils down a dramatic waterfall. It requires excellent teamwork, a tolerance for exposure and experience operating on hanging or semi-hanging anchors.\n<\/p><p>It is strongly recommended that you do this in low flow conditions only which the <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https:\/\/canyoninginvictoria.org\">Canyoning Around Victoria guidebook<\/a> describes as 1.3m or less at the <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http:\/\/www.bom.gov.au\/fwo\/IDV67209\/IDV67209.583003.plt.shtml\">Buckland River at Harris Lane river gauge<\/a>. The book states \"anything but low flow is a foolhardy misadventure\".\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Drive to and park at George Day Visitor Area (<a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external free\" href=\"https:\/\/maps.app.goo.gl\/Qv8Ai9jgUQWhMQDz6\">https:\/\/maps.app.goo.gl\/Qv8Ai9jgUQWhMQDz6<\/a>) near Mount Buffalo Chalet.\n<\/p><p>R1 is from bolts with mallions on a large boulder.

Buy the book and support Rob and Sam. They put in an inordinate amount of effort to create the book.\n<\/p><p>The book includes a great topo.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading3\"><h3 id=\"Tips\">Tips<\/h3><\/div>\n<ul><li>Do not underestimate this canyon. It requires good teamwork, SRT and preparation. Be ready for hanging anchors, cold water and exposure.<\/li>\n<li>The anchor for R4 is cold and wet... you will be showered upon while you manage the anchor. You WILL get cold. Wetsuit hoods and spray jackets are recommended. It is also difficult to spot in anything but the lowest of flow. You can bypass this anchor by using two 80m ropes from the actor of R3.<\/li>\n<li>Take a <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https:\/\/www.kong.it\/en\/product\/panic\/\">Kong Panic Draw<\/a> (45cm version) for R7 if you're short or even moderately tall. It's high and out over the edge... and can even be difficult for tall people to reach. It may also come in handy for the R6 anchor.<\/li><\/ul>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading3\"><h3 id=\"Photos\">Photos<\/h3><\/div>\n<p><br clear=\"all\" \/>\nLooking up at R3 anchor (where the canyoner is standing) and the rope descending from R2.

Avoid it by using two 80m ropes from the R3 anchor (photo of Ned Dale, taken by Kevin Weeks 13\/4\/2024).\n<\/p><p><br \/>\n<\/p><p><br clear=\"all\" \/>\nPhoto of the R7 anchor demonstrating how high it is. Helps to have a <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https:\/\/www.kong.it\/en\/product\/panic\/\">Kong Panic Draw<\/a> or some other method of extension so you can clip the bolts.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>The exit begins ~200m down the creek from the bottom of R7. There is a small cairn on the RR that is hard to spot. The ascent is almost opposite (south) of the tourist lookout on the northern side of the canyon.\n<\/p><p>You will eventually meet the climbers track (cairns and hand-lines) that is used to access Angel's Buttress and The Path of Genghis Buttress -<a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external free\" href=\"https:\/\/www.thecrag.com\/en\/climbing\/australia\/buffalo\/the-gorge-south-side\/area\/11983567\">https:\/\/www.thecrag.com\/en\/climbing\/australia\/buffalo\/the-gorge-south-side\/area\/11983567<\/a>.
