A number of wilderness canyons were added to this\nedition, presumably after a sketch map was shared with the author, and\npresumably that was a piece of paper that had been photo-copied several\ntimes and was difficult to read. Rick Jamieson must have interpreted the\nword as Ian's rather than Jan's.</p>\n",
