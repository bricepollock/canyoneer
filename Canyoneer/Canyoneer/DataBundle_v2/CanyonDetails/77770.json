The canyon was added to Rick Jamieson's 5th edition guidebook with a grid reference. A number of wilderness canyons were added to this edition, presumably after a sketch map was shared with the author, and presumably that was a piece of paper that had been photo-copied several times and was difficult to read. Rick Jamieson must have interpreted the word as Ian's rather than Jan's.\n<\/p>\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nParsed by mw‐api‐ext.codfw.canary‐cb4999499‐m2zz2\nCached time: 20240914192021\nCache expiry: 2592000\nReduced expiry: false\nComplications: [show‐toc]\nCPU time usage: 0.005 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.005 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 21\/1000000\nPost‐expand include size: 0\/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 0\/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 2\/100\nExpensive parser function count: 0\/500\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0\/20\nUnstrip post‐expand size: 0\/5000000 bytes\nNumber of Wikibase entities loaded: 0\/400\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%    0.000      1 -total\n-->\n<\/div>","riskRating":null,"months":["Oct","Nov","Dec","Jan","Feb","Mar","Apr"],"rappelLongestMeters":null,"rappelCountMin":null,"longitude":150.3263,"permit":"No","waterRating":null,"id":77770,"shuttleSeconds":null,"technicalRating":null,"geojson":null,"rappelCountMax":null}
