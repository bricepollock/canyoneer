Once in the canyon it is well shaded and generally brush free.\n<\/p>\n<ul><li><ul><li>As with all the Big T canyons your help is needed to keep access open. This entire area is still seeing a slow recovery from the old station fire which means lots of invasive plants and overgrowth in general can quickly close off access to these areas and\/or make your time in them miserable.

Grizzly Flat was scorched in the station fire and is covered in pretty thick brush and downed trees. There are paths through it but it takes quite a bit longer and getting to the drop-in is much more difficult. \n<\/p><p>You may choose to drop-in to the canyon further down than the original beta describes. However the canyon is very steep and loose and you will most likely have to rappel into it.
