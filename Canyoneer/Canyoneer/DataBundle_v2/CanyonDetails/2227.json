Unfortunately, rappelling or climbing Multnomah Falls is forbidden, but several scenic waterfalls lie upstream. Since most of the falls are visible from the trail, it is recommended to use retrievable anchors (or remove webbing afterwards). This creek is not run with any frequency.\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>R1: 60'.

There are no good anchors near the lip of the waterfall (Weisendanger Falls)\n<\/p><p>There are several waterfalls further downstream that appear to be no longer than 15-20 ft.

Be aware:  unlike other parts of the country, canyoning is not widely known or recognized in the Pacific NW.  Individuals climbing, rappelling, or slack-lining around such \"show waterfalls\" are far more likely to garner negative reactions from the general public at large. Negative reactions can lead to complaints and more rules by the local authorities.  If you must descend this creek, locals suggest descending when the number of hikers will be low - e.g. early in the morning or on weekdays.  Please be scrupulous about following a Leave-No-Trace ethic.  Leaving brightly colored anchors can annoy waterfall photographers, irk land managers, and may encourage the inexperienced \/ unprepared to attempt to follow you.\n<\/p>\n<ul><li>Rappelling is not permitted on Multnomah Falls - except for Portland Mountain Rescue as part of their annual cleanup effort.<\/li><\/ul>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Beta_sites\">Beta sites<\/h2><\/div>\n<ul><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20210527212206\/www.canyoneeringnorthwest.com\/MultnomahCreek\/Multnomah_Creek.php\">CanyoneeringNorthwest.com (archive.org)<\/a> &#160;: Multnomah Creek<\/li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http:\/\/ropewiki.com\/User:Super_Amazing_Map?id=Multnomah_Creek_-_Oregon\">Super Amazing Map<\/a> &#160;: Multnomah Creek<\/li><\/ul>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Background\">Background<\/h2><\/div>\n\n\n<\/div>","quality":4,"geojson":{"type":"FeatureCollection","features":[{"properties":{"name":"Approach","stroke":"#00CD00"},"geometry":{"type":"LineString","coordinates":[[-122.116899490356,45.5775076756751,0],[-122.116577625275,45.5771472145874,0],[-122.116599082947,45.5769519638654,0],[-122.11724281311,45.576816789891,0],[-122.116920948029,45.5766966349738,0],[-122.116062641144,45.5766816155911,0],[-122.115697860718,45.5765764797996,0],[-122.115590572357,45.57662153802,0],[-122.115848064423,45.5774475989878,0],[-122.116148471832,45.5776578671121,0],[-122.114903926849,45.5778981725757,0],[-122.113820314408,45.5782210814228,0],[-122.114925384521,45.5775827714438,0],[-122.11531162262,45.5775226948369,0],[-122.115113139153,45.5773837674372,0],[-122.114549875259,45.5774100510256,0],[-122.112329006195,45.5775076756751,0],[-122.113938331604,45.5771622338456,0],[-122.112334370613,45.5773424646305,0],[-122.112731337547,45.5771246856926,0],[-122.113476991653,45.5770420796677,0],[-122.111921310425,45.5768017705404,0],[-122.112854719162,45.5766515768136,0],[-122.112103700638,45.5765126472586,0],[-122.113171219826,45.57637371736,0],[-122.113616466522,45.5762911102303,0],[-122.113171219826,45.5762723358657,0],[-122.113498449325,45.5760845918744,0],[-122.112972736359,45.5760282685546,0],[-122.112699151039,45.5760864693174,0],[-122.112511396408,45.575949415812,0],[-122.112033963203,45.5759081119502,0],[-122.111384868622,45.5754199731012,0],[-122.110590934753,45.5753298546958,0],[-122.109797000885,45.5754650322496,0],[-122.109367847443,45.5754650322496,0],[-122.109045982361,45.5752998151952,0],[-122.108595371246,45.574699021809,0],[-122.107930183411,45.5742934826396,0],[-122.10741519928,45.5739330009195,0],[-122.107801437378,45.5735124359882,0]]},"type":"Feature"},{"geometry":{"type":"LineString","coordinates":[[-122.107565402985,45.5734523550266,0],[-122.107286453247,45.5738128398319,0],[-122.107393741608,45.5742634425847,0],[-122.10823059082,45.5747891412267,0],[-122.108724117279,45.5751646372437,0],[-122.108960151672,45.5755251110579,0],[-122.109668254852,45.5756302488179,0],[-122.110741138458,45.57561522915,0],[-122.11147069931,45.5756753077976,0],[-122.112135887146,45.5761409151377,0],[-122.112693786621,45.5760207587743,0]]},"type":"Feature","properties":{"name":"Descent","stroke":"#FF0000"}},{"geometry":{"type":"LineString","coordinates":[[-122.11269378662098,45.5760658174407,0],[-122.11357355117798,45.5760357783338,0],[-122.11329460143997,45.5763211492006,0],[-122.11344480514498,45.5764262854702,0],[-122.11207151412998,45.5765764797996,0],[-122.11277961731003,45.5766816155911,0],[-122.11172819137602,45.576936944551,0],[-122.11333751678501,45.5770270603773,0],[-122.11239337921097,45.5773725030384,0],[-122.11387395858799,45.577207291596,0],[-122.11256504058798,45.5775377139946,0],[-122.11507558822598,45.5773875222363,0],[-122.113788127899,45.5782586288427,0],[-122.11578369140602,45.5777930390619,0],[-122.11548328399698,45.5765914992104,0],[-122.11627721786499,45.5766515768136,0],[-122.117199897766,45.5768017705404,0],[-122.11627721786499,45.5769820024822,0],[-122.11698532104498,45.5775076756751,0]]},"type":"Feature","properties":{"stroke":"#F0F000","name":"Exit"}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[[-122.1075,45.57361,0]]},"properties":{"name":"Ecola Falls"}},{"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[[-122.10834,45.5747,0]]},"properties":{"name":"Weisendanger Falls"},"type":"Feature"},{"properties":{"name":"Multnomah Falls"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[[-122.115,45.57579,0]]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"name":"Parking"},"geometry":{"coordinates":[[-122.117,45.57758,0]],"type":"Point"}}]},"url":"https:\/\/ropewiki.com\/Multnomah_Creek","latitude":45.5764,"technicalRating":3,"timeRating":"II","shuttleSeconds":null,"longitude":-122.1156,"id":2227,"vehicle":"Passenger"}
