  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>A gorge high up on Dinkey Creek, that unfortunately is a little too\nwide and open to make a great canyoning route. That said, if you think\nof it more as a really pretty hike with some fun jumps, it's pretty fun,\nand in a beautiful location. The entire section can be hiked on the DC\nleft side/ up canyon right (east side). Most of the distance can be\nhiked next to the water. However, near the top, next to Dinkey Dome is a\nshort committing gorge of a hundred yards or so that is true\ncanyoneering. One can still hike high on the east side, but the inner\ngorge in this short section is not visible from the hike.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>Take Rock Creek Road off of Dinkey Creek Road to the north. Typical\nDinky Creek area road with lots of potholes. Eventually you cross Rock\nCreek and come out on the side of a steep slope with views of the Dinkey\nCreek drainage. Shortly after a road down the right will take you to a\nquarry where you can leave your exit vehicle: 37.117477,-119.154663</p>\n<p>Turn around, head back up the main road and make a right. At the next\nintersection make another right. The road soon becomes steeper and\nsubstantially more bumpy. Drive to a distinct left hand switchback and\npark there: 37.127469,-119.130783</p>\n<p>Hike up the small drainage going south from the switchback. Cross\nsome downfall and wet meadows to eventually cross a saddle then descend\ndown to Dinky Creek. Aiming a little left (east) will help you avoid\nsome cliffs on your way down.</p>\n<p>At this point it might be cool to cross the creek hike up to the top\nof Dinky Dome. It looks like if you go around the south side it would be\nclass 2, although I couldn't find any information on it, and I didn't\ntry.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>Head down the creek. There are some cool potholes and a short gorge\nas you pass underneath Dinkey Dome. Lower down a short canyon forms.\nThis can be descended by jumping, although keep in mind that one of the\njumps was about 15 or 20 feet and required a pretty precise landing. If\nthat's not your thing, you should be able to bypass this down canyon\nleft. At the end of the gorge is a drop into a chamber which could be\nrappelled (it's doubtful there are any smart jumping options here) or\nyou can simply climb out and around on the left.</p>\n<p>Further downstream the gorge opens up to lots of shallow and wide\nwaterfalls. It's pretty, and easy hiking. This gets steeper eventually,\noffering some fun little slides, and then some jumps, some of which can\nbe pretty big if you climb up and around on the side. Below it ends in a\nbig pool, trees pop up, and it becomes bouldery. Look for Cow Creek to\ncome in on the right and a ridge of dark rocks in front of you. That's\nyour exit.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>Head up the ridge of dark rocks. If you follow this up, which is a\nfairly pleasant climb, it will bring you back up to the quarry.</p>\n<p>If you don't wish to do a shuttle, simply hike back up the east side\nof Dinkey Creek to the start.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n",
