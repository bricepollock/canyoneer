{"months":[],"waterRating":"C1","riskRating":"R","description":"<div class=\"mw-content-ltr mw-parser-output\" lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><p>This is the middle section of Hortela, the section that begins at Levada do Norte, and ends at Levada do Seixal. It has significantly more water than the top section, and is a truly magical canyoning experience.\n<\/p><p>Note: Time beta above reflects Hortela 2 only - a complete Hortela Integral descent will take longer and includes a mandatory shuttle.\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>It is probably best to do this section combined with another (either start here and continue to the lower section, or start at section 1, and end at the end of this section). Otherwise, you’ll have both a long approach hike and a long exit hike. The approach to this section is either via Hortela section 1, or via Levada do Norte, which is accessed from Chão da Ribeira in Seixal, following the trail along the river to Verada do Lombo Barbinhos. Hike up Verada do Lombo Barbinhos, past Levada do Seixal, to Levada do Norte. Turn right and follow the levada to the start of the canyon (at the terminus of the levada).\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Use the CaMadeira link below to access an up-to-date canyon topo of sections 1 &amp; 2. This section of canyon starts at the yellow flag marking Levada do Norte, and has about double the water of Hortela 1. It’s beautifully rigged, so that most of the rappels are in side flow, or only briefly in pushy flow. Nonetheless, it’s a legitimately technical section, including hanging rebelays and all of the communication challenges that come with a lot of water. One of the most spectacular characteristics of this section of canyon, at least in March, is that it receives a lot of veils of overflow from the levada, creating amazing waterfalls all around you.\n<\/p><p>For those without much experience in European canyons, this should not be your first canyon on Madeira. For those who’ve done a few Madeira canyons, the rigging, while technical, is straight-forward, and the canyon topo should be sufficient beta. \n<\/p><p>Of note: the final rappel for those ending at Levada do Seixal (and not continuing to Hortela Inferior) is not straight-forward and benefits from some explanation. The anchor for this rappel is on canyon right. The first pitch is 9m to a hanging rebelay. The second pitch takes you to the levada. It is largely out of the flow, but once the levada comes into sight, start looking down to your right (directly down the fall line) for a hole where the water enters the tunnel. This is the exit. Do not stay on the rock face. Rappel straight down through the heart of the flow, to swing under into the tunnel, where you will come off rope on the levada, just inside the tunnel.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Follow the Levada do Seixal away from the tunnel, then head down Verada do Lombo Barbinhas, cross the Seixal river, and return on trail to your cars.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Red_tape\">Red tape<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Beta_sites\">Beta sites<\/h2><\/div>\n<ul><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http:\/\/descente-canyon.com\/canyoning\/canyon-description\/22141\">Descente-Canyon.com<\/a> &#160;: Hortela (Partie 2)<\/li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https:\/\/canyoning.camadeira.com\/canyons\/hortela\">CaMadeira.com<\/a> &#160;: Ribeira da Hortelã (inferior)<\/li><\/ul>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Background\">Background<\/h2><\/div>\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nParsed by mw‐api‐ext.codfw.main‐6779cc57fc‐hpng5\nCached time: 20240914191918\nCache expiry: 2592000\nReduced expiry: false\nComplications: [show‐toc]\nCPU time usage: 0.006 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.007 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 21\/1000000\nPost‐expand include size: 0\/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 0\/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 2\/100\nExpensive parser function count: 0\/500\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0\/20\nUnstrip post‐expand size: 0\/5000000 bytes\nNumber of Wikibase entities loaded: 0\/400\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%    0.000      1 -total\n-->\n<\/div>","rappelCountMax":12,"id":16070,"version":"58ac581e25a56a82613fe98068d0aef361403560b5f623d4999beb03350d1f28","geojson":{"features":[{"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[[-17.108011,32.779575,0]]},"properties":{"name":"Start"},"type":"Feature"},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"name":"End"},"geometry":{"coordinates":[[-17.111256,32.782211,0]],"type":"Point"}},{"properties":{"name":"Parking Approach"},"geometry":{"coordinates":[[-17.10144,32.765114,0]],"type":"Point"},"type":"Feature"},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[[-17.114046,32.796684,0]]},"properties":{"name":"Parking Exit"}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[[-17.109972,32.788296,0]]},"properties":{"name":"Waypoint Approach\/Exit"}}],"type":"FeatureCollection"},"name":"Hortela (Part 2)","quality":4.6,"technicalRating":4,"rappelLongestMeters":30,"shuttleSeconds":null,"latitude":32.7795,"vehicle":"Passenger","permit":"No","url":"https:\/\/ropewiki.com\/Hortela_(Part_2)","longitude":-17.1079,"rappelCountMin":12,"timeRating":"III"}
