It only has one rappel of 20 feet near the bottom after most of the slot has past.  Although the canyon is not very technical, the slotted sections above the one rappel are some of the more beautiful in the area and reminiscent of the narrows of Bear Canyon, but longer.  If looking to get your tech on, this is not the best choice, but if looking for a rarely visited hike through an absolutely gorgeous slot canyon, this may be a your ticket.\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Take the Bell Trail East of I-17 to Bell Crossing and head up the steep trail most of the way to the top of the Mesa after having crossed Wet Beaver Creek.  Once almost to the top you will see a steep scree slope that you will need to climb up and over the saddle into the main Long Canyon drainage.  Scramble carefully down the steep hill on the other side and to the bottom of Long Canyon, and head into the canyon.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Alternate_Approach\">Alternate Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Skip the big approaches and monster hikes. Ride a MTB up the Bell Trail two track to the wilderness boundary. Then hike to where Bell crosses wet beaver creek and proceed downstream to the confluence of long. Head up the canyon 0.7 miles, to all the good narrows that are at the bottom of the drainage. You will have the short 25ft up climb to get access but it is a mild  4th class climb. Come back and enjoy the crack with the extra time. \n<\/p><p>2.7 mile bike to boundary (hike if you wantâ€¦.ðŸ¥µ)\n1 mile hike\n0.7 mile up canyon \nCrack time after. \n3-5 hours\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Simple downclimbs and cold swims will take you through this beautiful slot.

Nonetheless this is a gorgeous canyon to explore.\n<\/p>\n\n\n<\/div>","permit":"No","version":"5536dad21fbbb45c3ee5fc8e1f78467fcec300b8e3c57f0d8064cfe7d3cd749b","rappelCountMin":1}
