It likely dries up in mid to late summer. The canyon offers numerous rappels and even a small jump. There are two two-tiered larger rappels that are memorable. The majority of anchors are natural anchors so canyoneers looking to enter Tule Creek for the first time of each year should bring ample webbing.\n<\/p><p>The canyon is not particularly committing and there are various points on the left and right side that could be used as potential escape routes. The canyon has a drainage of 1mi^2 but some rappels can still pack a punch if you rappel directly in the flow where the water channels are.\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Follow the motorcycle track (Squaw Creek Trail) until it reaches the closest point to the creek (about 3300 ft).

This is an alternate anchor that bypasses the first tier and reduces the chance of rope abrasion over the edge of the next tier. Not recommended to have the full team rappel from here due to damaging the hillside. Use R6a anchor or other for first pitch and have one person rig the second tier from this R6b location and drop the rope to the team. Only one person needs to man the station and can then complete the rappel from there. Other team members will get on the rope from below.\n<\/p>\n<style data-mw-deduplicate=\"TemplateStyles:r1062633282\">@media all and (max-width:720px){.mw-parser-output .content .thumb>div:not(.thumbinner){display:flex;justify-content:center;flex-wrap:wrap;align-content:flex-start;flex-direction:column}}body.skin-vector .mw-parser-output div.thumb>div:not(.thumbinner){font-size:94%;text-align:center;overflow:hidden;min-width:100px}body.skin-minerva .mw-parser-output div.thumb>div:not(.thumbinner){margin:0 auto;max-width:100%!important}<\/style> \n<div class=\"thumb tright\">\n<div style=\"display:table;\">\n<span class=\"mw-default-size\" typeof=\"mw:Error mw:File\/Frameless\">\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>R7: 20’ from webbing around a log \n<\/p><p>J1: 8’ jump \/ rappel \/ handline.

From Columbia River Gorge National Fish Hatchery Complex's Education Specialist, Cheri Anderson, the word Tule has two opposing meanings: 1) Tule is derived from \"Mitula\", a native American word meaning light flesh or white salmon; and 2) the opposing meaning is opposite of light - the word tule translates to dark. Tule Fall Chinook salmon's interior meat turns very light while their exterior turn very dark when they return from the ocean in the fall to spawn. Also, Tule elk on the Pacific coast are much darker colored than other elk.\n<\/p>\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nParsed by mw‐api‐ext.codfw.main‐6779cc57fc‐kvdkz\nCached time: 20240914192014\nCache expiry: 2592000\nReduced expiry: false\nComplications: [show‐toc]\nCPU time usage: 0.032 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.038 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 120\/1000000\nPost‐expand include size: 629\/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 28\/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 8\/100\nExpensive parser function count: 0\/500\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0\/20\nUnstrip post‐expand size: 529\/5000000 bytes\nLua time usage: 0.002\/10.000 seconds\nLua memory usage: 606898\/52428800 bytes\nNumber of Wikibase entities loaded: 0\/400\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%   27.354      1 -total\n100.00%   27.354      1 Template:Pic\n 52.30%   14.306      1 Template:Str_number\/trim\n-->\n<\/div>","months":["May","Jun","Jul"],"waterRating":"C","id":64881,"riskRating":null,"rappelLongestMeters":39.62,"technicalRating":3,"version":"6f137087f2fc6509ea014c8e55d58421e9c515684df436c782d081bfc5532091","vehicle":"Passenger","latitude":46.3295}
