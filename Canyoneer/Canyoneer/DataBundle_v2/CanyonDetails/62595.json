  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>A short descent into West Fork with a single large spire at the\nconfluence guarding the canyon. Cool dramatic walls towards bottom. Some\nthorny and viney brush along the way. Great canyon for those looking to\nexplore a rarely ventured area. Offers some of the best and longest\ndownclimbing sections of any canyon in the Flagstaff/Sedona area. Canyon\nhas a pretty cool narrowish section at the beginning of it and feels\nlike an actual canyon, and not just a wide open series of ledges.\nDefinitely feels like being in a place that very few have ever been\nto.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>Take 535 in off of 89A to 535A left to the parking area at the large\nclearing and start the approach there.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>A handful of drops before reaching West Fork. If I had to pick, The\nPerch would be a better option to run out of these two next door\nneighbors.</p>\n<p><strong>R1:</strong> 40' off of tree RDC after short downclimb.\nCanyon narrows up nicely here.</p>\n<p>Three great separate downclimb sections. Some may want to rappel,\nothers may need handline or partner assist for spots. Way fun and\nchallenging. Biggest section, may require as much as 150' of rope, if\nchoosing to rappel.</p>\n<p><strong>R2:</strong> 90' off of tree LDC. Drops into a larger canyon\ncoming down from DCL.</p>\n<p>Continue down larger canyon. A few downclimbs and hiking through\nviney vegetation that makes seeing where you are stepping sometimes\ndifficult.</p>\n<p><strong>R3:</strong> 55' off of tree RDC.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>The exit is up Flintstone Canyon and is the same exit as The Perch. A\nbit steep but puts you pretty close to your vehicle.</p>\n<p>Lots of loose rock near top. Steep and brushy. A few scramble\nsections with exposure.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<p><a\nhref=\"https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.3880762881944123&amp;type=3\">https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.3880762881944123&amp;type=3</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n<p>First descent by Jay Wisocki and William L.</p>\n",
