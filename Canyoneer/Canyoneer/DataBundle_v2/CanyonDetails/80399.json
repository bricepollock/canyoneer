From the rim a trail winds it way from top to bottom of this creek. This creek has a substantial flow and we elected to keep out of main flow and offset our self’s to the flow. Warning main flow looks incredible powerful and not to friendly, main flow can be avoid on all drop.\n<\/p><p>Their are definitely more canyon in and around the in and around the Methow and the Pasayten waiting to be explored.\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Follow falls creek trail to its end, a intersection with a forest road. Hop into the creek and creek walk until you find your first obstacle. Could enter creek earlier but route not explored yet.\n<\/p><p>Shuttle option. Gate was locked when we visited.

Webbing should be found on 4 of the rappels.\n<\/p><p>We avoided being directly in flow as it looked a bit too intense, all drops can be done flow adjacent or out of flow.\n<\/p><p>A series a small DC are found within this canyon but I will only mention ones of note.\n<\/p><p>DC first falls ~10ft via a dry section of rock center canyon. Anchors available if flow prevents downclimb\n<\/p><p><b>R1<\/b>: 50’ off boulder. DCR using horns had mild flow.

To check before sliding is advised and can be done easily.\n<\/p><p><b>R5<\/b>: 40’ off tree DCR into grotto. Do not jump, is shallower then appears (6-7ft)\n<\/p><p><b>R6<\/b>: 35’ off tree DCR. Be warned that the DCR wall is under cut and could be hazardous in higher flow.\n<\/p><p>The next sequence can be easily skipped if not feeling like a multi pitch sequence or exploring a new route\n<\/p><p><b>R7<\/b>: we did in 2 pitch’s.
