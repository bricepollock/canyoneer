Hike a short distance until you can see Munson Creek. Head down the narrow canyon. This should be done only by those who are familiar with swift water canyoneering techniques. Even in late summer the current is strong. There are three small falls close together. The first two are about 7ft. You can descend them both by rappelling from a small tree on the right. You might be tempted to jump the first falls since it is small. However, the water at the bottom is shallow. The second falls might be OK to jump, but I'm not sure. The third falls is called <i>Duwee Falls<\/i>. It is shown on maps but is rarely seen. The canyon blocks all views unless you make the arduous trip in the creek itself. Rappel the 15ft waterfall into a swirling pothole. A fallen log at the lip provides an anchor.\n<\/p><p>Downstream the canyon widens, and the creek descends steeply over small boulders. Hoodoos are on both canyon walls. The ones on the left wall are especially large and are collectively known as the Colonades.\"\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading3\"><h3 id=\"Sinnott_Canyon\">Sinnott Canyon<\/h3><\/div>\n<p>From the point where the Godfrey Glen trail crosses the dry creek on a small bridge, backtrack 150ft and then drop into the creekbed.  Follow it down a short distance\n<\/p><p>R1:  20ft on loose compacted pumice.  Beware rockfall.\n<\/p><p>Hike down the drainage to the confluence with Annie Creek.  The lower end of the canyon is quite scenic.  Watch for a pinnacle with a small cannon-hole in it.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading3\"><h3 id=\"Lodgepole_Canyon\">Lodgepole Canyon<\/h3><\/div>\n<p>From Canyoneering NW:\n\"Just before the trail starts to make a big 180 degree turn leave the trail and head right (north) to a dry creek bed. Head down to a drop-off with a large log leaning against it. A large tree on the left provides an anchor to make a 30ft rappel over loose rock. Head down the canyon and enter a narrow slot. Below the slot is the confluence with Annie Creek.\"\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Exit is directly up an exciting knife-ridge located between Sinnott and Lodgepole Canyons.  The ridge is a catwalk and drops off steeply on both sides.  Not recommended for the clumsy.  Return to the trailhead.\n<\/p>\n<ul><li>Another possible exit with a car shuttle is via the Annie Creek trail and head up into the Mazama campground.<\/li>\n<li>Reportedly it is also possible to ascend Annie Creek or Goodbye Creek all the way up to the road.<\/li><\/ul>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Red_tape\">Red tape<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Crater Lake National Park entrance fee.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Beta_sites\">Beta sites<\/h2><\/div>\n<ul><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20210527212206\/www.canyoneeringnorthwest.com\/AnnieCreekGodfreyGlen\/Annie_Creek_-_Godfrey_Glen.php\">CanyoneeringNorthwest.com (archive.org)<\/a> &#160;: Annie Creek - Godfrey Glen<\/li><\/ul>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Background\">Background<\/h2><\/div>\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nParsed by mw‐api‐ext.codfw.main‐6779cc57fc‐nnqvj\nCached time: 20240914191907\nCache expiry: 2592000\nReduced expiry: false\nComplications: [show‐toc]\nCPU time usage: 0.007 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.008 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 30\/1000000\nPost‐expand include size: 0\/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 0\/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 2\/100\nExpensive parser function count: 0\/500\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0\/20\nUnstrip post‐expand size: 0\/5000000 bytes\nNumber of Wikibase entities loaded: 0\/400\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%    0.000      1 -total\n-->\n<\/div>","rappelCountMin":1,"longitude":-122.1529,"permit":"No","name":"Munson Creek","rappelLongestMeters":null,"technicalRating":3,"id":2279,"latitude":42.8594,"riskRating":null,"months":["Jul","Aug","Sep"],"waterRating":"C","timeRating":"II","geojson":null,"url":"https:\/\/ropewiki.com\/Munson_Creek","rappelCountMax":3,"shuttleSeconds":null,"quality":2,"vehicle":"Passenger"}
