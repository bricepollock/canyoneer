  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>A short canyon with numerous rappels, Narrow corridors, and great\nscenery of the colorado river all the way down.</p>\n<p>Please, remember that <strong>installation of permanent fixed\nhardware is prohibited</strong> in Lake Mead National Recreation Area.\n<strong>No bolts.</strong></p>\n<p>Do not enter this canyon if you do not have the knowledge to entirely\ninspect and replace anchorage. Do not assume anchorage is prepared to\nhold any load bearing weight upon your arrival. Bring anchorage\nreplacement material and be prepared to replace all anchorage. This\ncanyon floods and becomes hot. The sunbaked and worn webbing can break.\nInspect and Replace all anchorage in this canyon.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>The first vertical encounter you will face is a downclimb. There is\nopportunity to build an anchorage for a master point but we meat\nanchored and spotted LAMAR. Here you will find a R1, 40 ft rap that\ncurls around a slightly awkward chute. It could be downclimbed and the\npull could have potential of sticking. downclimb the next two dry falls\nuntil you get to R2 which is around 50 ft into a pothole. You can climb\nout of this pothole or you can traverse the wall. You will start seeing\nthe river from here. IMO, this is where the scenic views and the\nremainder of the canyon begins. You quickly descend at least * rappels\nbetween 20 and 60 ft in length. Each rappel will be very close to each\nother. The canyon narrows and meanders down the mountain rapidly while\nthe views of the colorado river can be seen. There is one two stage\nrappel that could use an additional anchor as the rock was catching the\npull, around a bend. Continue down until you get to the river.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>We exited with the wind coming from the south. This allowed us to be\npushed upstream and exit VIA, AZ hot Springs. You can paddle upstream or\nexit Big Horn canyon if you parked a shuttle car at Big Horn. If you are\npaddling into the wind you might want to consider your teams strength\nand desire, than decide if a shuttle car at the TH of Big Horn will be\nthe best option.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<p>Get a wind and weather report before heading out to decide what\ncanyon you want to exit. You must have a USGC approved PFD and\nwatercraft for your exit strategy.</p>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<p>{{#ev:youtube|v=Y7arCrPc7PY}}</p>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n<p>This canyon was named \"Holy Water Canyon\" in 2021 after its first\ntechnical descent. The name originated from an unexpectedly large amount\nof water encountered in the canyon's potholes on that particular\nday.</p>\n",
