There is opportunity to build an anchorage for a master point but we meat anchored and spotted LAMAR. Here you will find a R1, 40 ft rap that curls around a slightly awkward chute.  It could be downclimbed and the pull could have potential of sticking. downclimb the next two dry falls until you get to R2 which is around 50 ft into a pothole.  You can climb out of this pothole or you can traverse the wall.  You will start seeing the river from here. IMO, this is where the scenic views and the remainder of the canyon begins. You quickly descend at least * rappels between 20 and 60 ft in length. Each rappel will be very close to each other. The canyon narrows and meanders down the mountain rapidly while the views of the colorado river can be seen.  There is one two stage rappel that could use an additional anchor as the rock was catching the pull, around a bend. Continue down until you get to the river.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>We exited with the wind coming from the south.  This allowed us to be pushed upstream and exit VIA, AZ hot Springs.  You can paddle upstream or exit Big Horn canyon if you parked a shuttle car at Big Horn. If you are paddling into the wind you might want to consider your teams strength and desire, than decide if a shuttle car at the TH of Big Horn will be the best option.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Red_tape\">Red tape<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Get a wind and weather report before heading out to decide what canyon you want to exit.
