  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>Another nice tributary along the Lewis River which contains a\nbeautiful section of narrows and falls concluding with <em>Pin Creek\nFalls</em> (35ft). Access is easy and straightforward. A short outing,\nbut all-around fun. Destined to be another classic in the Lewis River\narea.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Watershed: 8.5mi^2. Highest point in the drainage is about 5200ft on\nQuartz Creek Ridge.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>Stash a shuttle car at the exit where Pin Creek crosses under FR 90.\nThis is also a good place to check the flow. Drive up FR 9085 to the\nfirst switchback and find a place to park; there's room for several\ncars.</p>\n<p>From the parking area, hike roughly northwest through open forest for\n~5min until dropping into Pin Creek. Head downstream. Reach the top of\nthe technical section in 5-10min.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Shortcut approach: This option cuts off some of the pretty parts of\nthe creek-walking. Entry into the creek is pretty steep, but it drops\nyou right in above the narrow chute leading to R1.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>For such a short section of creek, Lower Pin is surprisingly\naction-packed. It retains enough water to be fun into September. Be\naware: jumps are a leading cause of canyon injuries (broken ankles &amp;\nlegs). Always send someone down to check the depth first &amp; check for\nsubmerged obstacles.</p>\n<p>Please do not leave webbing on unlinked bolts. This is a common\ntechnique in aquatic canyons.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The creek turns a corner and descends a 30ft low-angle chute. If\nhigh flow, bypass DCR.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Continue downstream a short distance. Upon turning the next\ncorner:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Climb down to narrow opening. This is currently deep enough to climb\nup the rocks on either side and jump into the water. <strong>Caution:\nThe logs above are getting rotten!</strong> R1 is on the far side of the\npool.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>R1: 35ft from two bolts DCR. (There are two bolts DCL on the far\nside of the pool below if you want to rig a guided rappel.)</li>\n<li>R2: 25ft from vertical log in the pool. High flow: use a tree far\nDCR.</li>\n<li>R3: 50ft rappel ... or downclimb to a nice 8ft jump (or relatively\neasy bypass). Then downclimb easily past a second small cascade or\nsecond short jump.</li>\n<li>R4: 60ft from unlinked bolts (both DCL and DCR; DCL will put you in\nmore flow) into <strong>The Punchbowl</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Punchbowl is a terrific place to practice jumps at many different\nheights. The pool has been measured at ~20ft deep at its center in 2022.\nFor the action seekers, climb up onto a huge old-growth log just over\nthe pool (aka the Diving Board) and jump 30-35ft into the pool.\nAwesome!</p>\n<ul>\n<li>R5: 25ft from single bolt DCR. Alternatively, jump or carefully\ndownclimb DCR. Be sure to scout the pool carefully as some places are\ndeeper than others. High water: bypass the chute from DCL; not a lot of\ngreat anchor options.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>R6: <strong>Pin Creek Falls</strong> 35ft. There are several\noptions. This waterfall is visited regularly by waterfall photographers,\nso please use unobtrusive webbing.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><ul>\n<li>Low-moderate flow: Locate a small tree DCL and rig a 30ft\nretrievable traverse line down to an unlinked bolt station (glue-ins)\njust above a small pothole / bathtub on the left side of the falls. (As\nof September 2023, there's also an older bad expansion bolt here that\nshould probably be decommissioned.)</li>\n<li>High flow: rappel from a tree DCR.</li>\n<li>Undecided: rappel from a single bolt in a boulder in creek\ncenter.</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>Head downstream 5min from the last falls to reach the bridge. To\navoid bank erosion, pass under the bridge and find an easy exit\nimmediately DCL.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Alternatively, if you don't have a shuttle, it's an easy hike back\nup through the forest. Takes about 15min.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<p>None.</p>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<p><a\nhref=\"https://youtu.be/ctIN4wHTY5k\">https://youtu.be/ctIN4wHTY5k</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n<p>First known descent of Pin Creek was made by Keith Campbell in August\n2017.</p>\n",
