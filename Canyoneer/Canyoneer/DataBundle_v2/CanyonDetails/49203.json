Access is easy and straightforward.  A short outing, but all-around fun.  Destined to be another classic in the Lewis River area.\n<\/p>\n<ul><li>Watershed: 8.5mi^2.  Highest point in the drainage is about 5200ft on Quartz Creek Ridge.<\/li><\/ul>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Stash a shuttle car at the exit where Pin Creek crosses under FR 90.  This is also a good place to check the flow.  Drive up FR 9085 to the first switchback and find a place to park;  there's room for several cars. \n<\/p><p>From the parking area, hike roughly northwest through open forest for ~5min until dropping into Pin Creek.  Head downstream.  Reach the top of the technical section in 5-10min.\n<\/p>\n<ul><li>Shortcut approach:  This option cuts off some of the pretty parts of the creek-walking. Entry into the creek is pretty steep, but it drops you right in above the narrow chute leading to R1.<\/li><\/ul>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>For such a short section of creek, Lower Pin is surprisingly action-packed.  It retains enough water to be fun into September.  Be aware: jumps are a leading cause of canyon injuries (broken ankles &amp; legs).  Always send someone down to check the depth first &amp; check for submerged obstacles.\n<\/p><p>Please do not leave webbing on unlinked bolts. This is a common technique in aquatic canyons.\n<\/p>\n<ul><li>The creek turns a corner and descends a 30ft low-angle chute.  If high flow, bypass DCR.<\/li><\/ul>\n<p>Continue downstream a short distance.  Upon turning the next corner:\n<\/p>\n<ul><li>Climb down to narrow opening.  This is currently deep enough to climb up the rocks on either side and jump into the water. <b>Caution: The logs above are getting rotten!<\/b>  R1 is on the far side of the pool.<\/li><\/ul>\n<ul><li>R1: 35ft from two bolts DCR. (There are two bolts DCL on the far side of the pool below if you want to rig a guided rappel.)<\/li>\n<li>R2: 25ft from vertical log in the pool.  High flow: use a tree far DCR.<\/li>\n<li>R3: 50ft rappel ... or downclimb to a nice 8ft jump (or relatively easy bypass). Then downclimb easily past a second small cascade or second short jump.<\/li>\n<li>R4: 60ft from unlinked bolts (both DCL and DCR;  DCL will put you in more flow) into <b>The Punchbowl<\/b>.<\/li><\/ul>\n<p>The Punchbowl is a terrific place to practice jumps at many different heights. The pool has been measured at ~20ft deep at its center in 2022. For the action seekers, climb up onto a huge old-growth log just over the pool (aka the Diving Board) and jump 30-35ft into the pool.  Awesome! \n<\/p>\n<ul><li>R5: 25ft from single bolt DCR. Alternatively, jump or carefully downclimb DCR.  Be sure to scout the pool carefully as some places are deeper than others. High water: bypass the chute from DCL; not a lot of great anchor options.<\/li><\/ul>\n<ul><li>R6: <b>Pin Creek Falls<\/b> 35ft.  There are several options. This waterfall is visited regularly by waterfall photographers, so please use unobtrusive webbing.<\/li><\/ul>\n<ul><li><ul><li>Low-moderate flow:  Locate a small tree DCL and rig a 30ft retrievable traverse line down to an unlinked bolt station (glue-ins) just above a small pothole \/ bathtub on the left side of the falls. (As of September 2023, there's also an older bad expansion bolt here that should probably be decommissioned.)<\/li>\n<li>High flow: rappel from a tree DCR.<\/li><\/ul><\/li><\/ul>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Head downstream 5min from the last falls to reach the bridge.  To avoid bank erosion, pass under the bridge and find an easy exit immediately DCL.\n<\/p>\n<ul><li>Alternatively, if you don't have a shuttle, it's an easy hike back up through the forest. Takes about 15min.<\/li><\/ul>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Red_tape\">Red tape<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>None.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Beta_sites\">Beta sites<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media<\/h2><\/div>\n<ul><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/QEI-GgYpXvQ\">YouTube September 07, 2023.
