I thought that was appropriate because by all rights there shouldn’t be Ponderosa trees out there in the desert. The nearest other ones that I know of are out on the east end of Spencer Flat, growing in a big joint crack SW of Main &amp; Center, some 20 miles away. Of course I never published the name. I haven’t heard of a published name for it by Steve Allen or anyone else. I would argue in favor of Ponderosa Fork because of the uniqueness of that tree. “Grove” is rather generic and could be most anything anywhere. I added “Fork” because it’s a fork of the Dry Fork.<\/i>\n<\/p>\n\n\n<\/div>","riskRating":"R","rappelCountMax":3,"timeRating":"III","months":[],"shuttleSeconds":null,"longitude":-111.1274,"waterRating":"B","latitude":37.4676,"rappelLongestMeters":10.67,"version":"1b97c3a2eb685fc2a7d1e1f018ff8d78a93b8343d8c668e2e9f8131681e5454f","vehicle":null,"url":"https:\/\/ropewiki.com\/Ponderosa_Fork","name":"Ponderosa Fork","permit":"No","technicalRating":4,"quality":4,"id":771,"rappelCountMin":3}
