Can be combined with Middle Ice Lake Creek and also with Lower Ice Lake Creek for a more substantial canyon day. The views are breathtaking.\nThe R rating is for the entrapment possibility on the second rappel (the big one where you get blasted in a narrow shaft). On the lower 25 feet there is a gap on canyon left that is hardly visible, wide enough for a pack or limb to get caught. This is in substantial flow and rescue would need to be immediate.\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Red_tape\">Red tape<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Beta_sites\">Beta sites<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Background\">Background<\/h2><\/div>\n\n\n<\/div>","shuttleSeconds":null,"url":"https:\/\/ropewiki.com\/Ice_Lake_Creek_(Upper)","months":["Aug","Sep"],"vehicle":"High Clearance","latitude":37.8139,"name":"Ice Lake Creek (Upper)"}
