  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>Combine this canyon with a hike to Island Lake, one of Colorado's\npremier hiking destinations, which is only 120ft more elevation gain and\n1/2 mile further. Can be combined with Middle Ice Lake Creek and also\nwith Lower Ice Lake Creek for a more substantial canyon day. The views\nare breathtaking. The R rating is for the entrapment possibility on the\nsecond rappel (the big one where you get blasted in a narrow shaft). On\nthe lower 25 feet there is a gap on canyon left that is hardly visible,\nwide enough for a pack or limb to get caught. This is in substantial\nflow and rescue would need to be immediate.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n",
