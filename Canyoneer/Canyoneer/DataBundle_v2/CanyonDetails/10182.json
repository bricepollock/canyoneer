  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>Meet Davis’ bigger sister. She’ll initially greet you with an open\nfree-hanging rappel into a beautiful basalt amphitheater that’s lined\nwith an inset cave that has been carved out by the winds. She’ll even\ntake you for a spin down a one-of-kind corkscrew rappel where the water\nmagically spirals down the rocks and into a “rain” room. You pause\nbefore entering in the spiral of water...partially in awe of her beauty\nbut also due to a nagging feeling that the walls are starting to close\nin and you’re not entirely sure what awaits. The water begins to pour\ndown on you and the sides the room but your feet hit a platform and\nyou’re able to disconnect safely. It feels like you’re caught in a\ndownpour but you’re in the PNW, so you shrug your shoulders and think\n“no big deal, it’s the rain” and swim across and out of the rain room.\nThe scenery here is unreal as you leave the rain room – the waterfall\nsplits into two and unusual basalt fins emerge from the ground. She’s\ntaken you a place where few have gone and you find yourself laughing out\nin joy at the sights before you.</p>\n<p>But something darker awaits as you turn the corner. The walls\nsuddenly close in and seemingly grow over 200 feet high. The sunlight\nand lush green landscape disappear and all that’s before you is a dark\nand narrow passage way filled with cold water and a lot of unknowns.\nIt’s dark. It’s too late for escape. A sense of foreboding permeates\nthroughout air as you carefully swim through the dark corridors and\nnegotiate your way through slippery log jams, awkward rappel starts, and\nthe threat of siphons. Ancient trees, some over 4 feet wide, lay trapped\nin the darkness and you wonder at how powerful she must become in higher\nwater.</p>\n<p>As your eyes get accustomed to the dark corridors and swims under and\nover log jams, the light slowly begins to illuminate the canyon walls\nand a sense a relief floods in. You peer over the lip and find a 20’\njump into a deep pool (or rappel) and a short scramble up to the next\nrappel. It’s the last and final drop. She won’t let you go too easily\nthough – there’s a small but deep hydraulic mid-way down where you must\npush off the edge and swing to the lip. Continue down a chute where the\nwater angrily shoots over the edge and hits the opposing wall and lands\ninto a round basin full of logs that have been spit out from the\nconfines of the canyon. It’s done – you’ve met Davis’ big sister. She\nwas more volatile and had more hidden up her sleeve...but yet she may\nend up being your favorite.</p>\n<h2 id=\"technical_notes\">Technical Notes</h2>\n<p><font color=\"red\"><strong>CAUTION: PLEASE READ</strong></font></p>\n<p>Do not underestimate the technical ropework and aquatic nature of Big\nCreek. This canyon lives up to its name -- it is big, dark, and\nforeboding. If you're new to running Pacific Northwest canyons, this is\nnot a good one to start with. This is a really bad place to have an\naccident. There were at least four near-misses by inexperienced groups\nin Big Creek in 2022.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Groups should be familiar with how to rig unlinked bolts.\n<strong>Please do not add webbing to them</strong>. Big Creek sees\nmassive floods in the winter and early spring. Giant logs may appear and\ndisappear from year to year. Any webbing or fixed lines may present an\nopportunity to snag flood debris getting washed down the canyon. The\nrelentless force of the water leveraged against the bolts can weaken,\ndamage, or even destroy the anchor.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Groups should be familiar with how to rig retrievable traverse lines\nto access exposed anchors (ex: self-belay or team belay). Make sure your\nteam can recognize and rig these traverses appropriately. Please do not\nadd webbing to traverse anchors or leave fixed lines in the canyon.\nAgain, flood debris can snag in the webbing and weaken the bolts.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Jumping into deep pools can be tremendous fun, but always send\nsomeone down first to check the depth and look for underwater obstacles\n(ex: underwater ledges, boulders, and impaling logs). Jumping is a\nleading cause of canyon injuries (i.e. broken ankles and legs).</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>It may be prudent for the first group through every year to have a\nbolt kit. Do not rely on natural anchors being available.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Beginners \"leading\" beginners is a common cause of canyon\naccidents.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"waterflow\">Waterflow</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>The gauge (USGS:14216000 Lewis River above Muddy River NR Cougar,\nWA) seem to be the best predictor of the flow you will find in this\ncanyon.</li>\n<li>Checkpoint: The reference pictures below are of the first rappel,\nafter this rappel you can still exit the canyon (DCL).</li>\n<li>Watershed: 15.5mi^2. Highest point of the drainage is about 4700'\nelevation.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>Before entering the canyon, plan your exit. There are (at least) two\noptions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Exit via the Speed Trail. You'll find the trailhead 0.5mi to the\nnorth on FR 90. Shuttle is optional, but will save you a short walk\nalong the road on finishing.</li>\n<li>Exit south via the Lewis River Trail. You'll need a shuttle for this\none. Backtrack on FR 90 for 3.8mi and turn right on FR 9039. Drive down\n0.6mi to a large parking area just before the bridge.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>After setting up the car shuttle, park at the former Big Creek\ntrailhead. (This trailhead was officially closed by the Forest Service\nafter a tree fell and damaged the former viewing platform. You can still\npark just off the shoulder of FR-90 and hike the trails at your own\nrisk.) Look for a well-maintained trail that leads from the old parking\narea to the top of Big Creek Falls (1-2 minute walk).</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>R1 (Big Creek Falls)</strong>: DCL - 130' off a webbing\nsling around a tree. The anchor DCL may cause the rope to run over a\nsharp edge near the lip. Edge protection/rope abrasion techniques are\nrecommended.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Alternate Anchors:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Use a tree DCR for less abrasion</li>\n<li>(Low water) Use a tree back from the main anchor. This allows\nrappelling in the flow.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It is possible to escape DCL below R1 via a steep user-trail that\nleads up to the abandoned trail network.</p>\n<p>Walk downstream 0.25mi.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>R2 (Corkscrew Falls)</strong>: DCL - 125' from a bolted\nanchor. Once you are down this rappel you are committed to the descent.\nAt the bottom of this falls is a deep pool known as the Rain Room.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Alternate Anchor: Rappel: DCR - 140'. Use a tree for a rappel more in\nthe flow. Note that the top is slippery and it's difficult to cross\nagainst the current until fully on rappel. Watch your footing as there\nare holes in the wall.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Jump</strong>: DCR - 8' into a deep pool. Jump out far\nenough to clear the sloping rock below. There is a single bolt DCR if\npreferred.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>R3</strong>: DCR - 40' from a bolted anchor. Take caution\nand set appropriate protection when accessing the bolts. At lower flow,\nit's possible to downclimb and jump about 20' leftover center.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>(Sidebar note: there appears to be a bolt ladder going directly up\nthe DCR wall just back from the R3 station. Possible escape route in\nhigh water? Whether it goes all the way out is unknown.)</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>R4</strong>: DCR - 35' from a somewhat exposed unlinked\nanchor at the lip. In high flow, beware a possible hydraulic and\nundercut DCL. Logs collect in here, so despite looking appealing for a\njump do NOT do it.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>R5 + traverse</strong>:\n<ul>\n<li>10ft DCL traverse from two bolts. Traverse line to access the\nexposed rappel station.</li>\n<li>40ft DCL from quasi-hanging unlinked anchor. Rappel out of the water\nto land onto a slab of rock. Note this rappel is subject to logjams that\nmay block access or divert the water flow, potentially making the bolt\nstation useless. Update Oct 2022: The hangers at the rappel station\nspin, but the bolts seemed sound. Keep an eye on this one.</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>6ft downclimb or careful jump. (A single bolt might be nice here in\nfuture.)</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>R6</strong>: 30' from a giant log set upside down in the\npool. This can also be a jump. If jumping, scout the depth first!</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>R7 (Cave Falls) + traverse</strong>: This is the grand\nfinale of the canyon and the crux of the route. <font color=\"red\">Do not\nunderestimate this sequence.</font> This is a two-stage rappel with a\ntraverse line to access the first anchor:\n<ul>\n<li>Traverse: 20' DCL traverse from two bolts. Traverse line to a bolted\nanchor near the edge. This traverse can be slippery.</li>\n<li>R7a: 50' DCL from two bolt station to the lip of the waterfall. This\nrappel requires good balance to maneuver around the wall DCL. A slip\ncould result in a dangerous pendulum into the flow. It may be a good\nidea to attach the rope (with sufficient slack) to the next anchor for\nR7b and treat it like a rebelay.</li>\n<li>R7b: 30' DCL from two bolt station at the lip of the waterfall (out\nof the flow) to the bottom of Cave Falls.</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul>\n<p>At the bottom, you may want to spend some time exploring this\nwonderful amphitheater and cave-like space under the falls. The creek\nbelow divides in two around a 200ft high mossy monolith. You can go\neither way around the monolith. DCR side is more impressive. Check the\ndownstream side of the monolith to find a dark dead-end tunnel (50'\nlong) leading to a 5ft falls.</p>\n<p>When ready, continue downstream from the monolith. The creek passes\nthrough interesting sections of bedrock, giant boulders, potholes, and\nother water features. There are a few swimmers along the way and at\nleast one good slide, but most can be avoided. After 20min or so,\nreach:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>R8 (Habitat Falls)</strong>: 20' two tier drop to chest-deep\npool. Rappel or bypass over the small \"ridge\" DCL and follow a use-trail\ndown to the bottom.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>After another 5min of walking reach the confluence with the Lewis\nRiver.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<h3 id=\"standard_exit_shuttle_optional\">Standard Exit (shuttle\noptional)</h3>\n<p>From the confluence, head upstream about 0.5mi to pick up the Speed\nTrail. There are two options:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ford directly across the Lewis River (easy in late summer) and\nbushwhack up the bank opposite to pick up the Lewis River Trail. Follow\nit right/north about 0.5mi. The trail undulates up and down a bit, but\nit's faster than hiking upriver in the creek. Keep going until you reach\na log with the words 'Speed Trail' carved into it. Ford the Lewis River\nagain (heading back east) to an overgrown meadowed bar. The Speed Trail\nis not obvious here, but cross the bar and head downstream 100ft to find\nit set back in the trees on the east side. The trail starts on the north\nside of a small creek (approx. UTM 10 583697mE 5106153mN). GPS is handy\nfor finding the correct location.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Head directly up the Lewis River, bushwhacking and crisscrossing the\nriver as needed for 0.5mi. Locate the Speed Trail as above.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Follow the Speed Trail upwards to FR 90 (~0.8mi, 700ft elevation\ngain). It's steep in sections and there is one area with significant\nblow-down. A flagged user trail bypasses the vegetative destruction.\nFrom the confluence, it takes about 1.5-2 hours to get back to FR 90. If\nyou didn't leave a shuttle car at the Speed trailhead, walk south on FR\n90 for 0.5mi to the Big Creek trailhead.</p>\n<h3 id=\"river_trail_exit_requires_shuttle\">River Trail Exit (requires\nshuttle)</h3>\n<p>Don't like steep hills with a heavy pack? If you don't mind some\nextra miles, you can hike south on the Lewis River Trail. Ford across\nthe Lewis River, go downstream about 100ft, then climb up onto the bank\nto find the trail. Follow it south and west for 4.5mi (+200ft gain\ncumulative) to the bridge on FR 9093. Takes maybe 1.5-2hrs. On the south\nside of the bridge is a large parking area, where, hopefully, you\nstashed your shuttle car earlier.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<p>None.</p>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><img src=\"rwl_en.png\" title=\"rwl_en.png\" alt=\"rwl_en.png\" /><a\nhref=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20210527212206/www.canyoneeringnorthwest.com/SouthCascadeProspects/Canyoneering_Prospects_in_the_South_Cascades.php\">CanyoneeringNorthwest.com\n(archive.org)</a> : Canyon Prospects in the South Cascades</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a\nhref=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/jeffbartlett/albums/72157673565072355\">https://www.flickr.com/photos/jeffbartlett/albums/72157673565072355</a>\nBig Creek, Sep 2016</li>\n<li><a\nhref=\"http://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.10154334417971103&amp;type=1&amp;l=6292bc7deb\">http://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.10154334417971103&amp;type=1&amp;l=6292bc7deb</a>\nBig Creek in High Water, Jul 2016</li>\n<li><a\nhref=\"https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.10104493718763478&amp;type=1&amp;l=db083cc66e\">https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.10104493718763478&amp;type=1&amp;l=db083cc66e</a>\nBig Creek First Descent, 13 Sep 2015</li>\n<li><img src=\"rwl_en.png\" title=\"rwl_en.png\" alt=\"rwl_en.png\" /><a\nhref=\"http://karl-helser.com/big-creek-canyoneer-9-27-15\">Karl Helser's\nNW Adventures</a> : Big Creek Canyoneer 9-27-15</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n<p>This canyon was first descended on 9/13/2015 by Evan Topinka, Luca\nChiarabini, and Tiffanie Lin. We didn’t expect to find such a committing\ncanyon as we had finished tackling Wahclella the day before. When we\nentered the dark section, Luca exclaimed, “sheeeet, I forgot to charge\nthe drill batteries!” Thankfully there were plenty of natural anchors.\n(Almost all the natural anchors were swept out by flooding the following\nwinter.) Many thanks to Ken Liebert, Robert Cobb, Joe Bugden, and Zach\nForsyth who provided information from scouting trips that made this trip\npossible.</p>\n",
