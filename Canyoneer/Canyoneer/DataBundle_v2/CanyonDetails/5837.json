  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>Long hiking approach, unless you drive an offroad vehicle from Skye\nCanyon area- which you could technically get within 0.25 mile of the\nstart of the loop. You see a square (box) on satellite view. Basically\nyou approach it from the north walking south, you go over an old dam,\nenter the canyon then you'll see an option to go right- take that loop\nall the way around. It gets tricky at the half way point as you have to\ncrest over a hill. There's no trail at this point. You'll see a big\nshelter cave on the side of a hill facing west and you basically\nscramble to the left of that up and over that hill. Recommended to\nnavigate with a GPS. Then you drop into the next drainage and turn left,\nheading downhill and it will get more canyon like as you continue.</p>\n<p>Expect 2-4 short rappels up to 20'. There used to be metal ladders\nthere, but someone took them out. Canyon not done often. Expect to\nrebuild anchors and inspect everything.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a\nhref=\"https://www.stavislost.com/hikes/trail/box-canyon-and-hidden-canyon\">https://www.stavislost.com/hikes/trail/box-canyon-and-hidden-canyon</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<p>{{#ev:youtube|v=9D_Plntkd9o}}</p>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n"
