In big snowpack years, aim for at least later in July.  Try to get into this canyon before September in low snowpack years.  This would be great to pair up with Arrastra in one day without having to move your vehicle.\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Follow Country Road 2 East out of Silverton along the Animas River.  Turn South on County Road 52 shortly out of town and cross the Animas River.  There are several campsite locations along this road.  Follow the road left when it forks slightly and take the hard 90 deg left at the top of a hill, then go right at the next intersection.  Follow this road until it switchbacks sharply to go up toward Arrastra and Silver Lake.  Park here.  Driving up higher doesn't help for Woodchuck Creek and complicates turning around.  In 2014, there was a rock too big to move in the middle of the road higher up.\n<\/p><p>Follow the old trail from the parking space toward Arrastra and hike up the old faint trail north of Woodchuck.  You'll lose it here and there, but if you see where it's headed from where you've parked your car you'll be in good shape.  When you get to the scree slope, cross it without gaining too much elevation.  The trail continues on the opposite side; there's an overgrown bush that has blocked its view.\n<\/p>\n<style data-mw-deduplicate=\"TemplateStyles:r1062633282\">@media all and (max-width:720px){.mw-parser-output .content .thumb>div:not(.thumbinner){display:flex;justify-content:center;flex-wrap:wrap;align-content:flex-start;flex-direction:column}}body.skin-vector .mw-parser-output div.thumb>div:not(.thumbinner){font-size:94%;text-align:center;overflow:hidden;min-width:100px}body.skin-minerva .mw-parser-output div.thumb>div:not(.thumbinner){margin:0 auto;max-width:100%!important}<\/style> \n<div class=\"thumb tright\">\n<div style=\"display:table;\">\n<span class=\"mw-default-size\" typeof=\"mw:Error mw:File\/Frameless\">\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>Stop where you want to start your descent.
