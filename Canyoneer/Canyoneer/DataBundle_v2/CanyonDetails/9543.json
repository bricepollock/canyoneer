Try to get\ninto this canyon before September in low snowpack years. This would be\ngreat to pair up with Arrastra in one day without having to move your\nvehicle.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>Follow Country Road 2 East out of Silverton along the Animas River.\nTurn South on County Road 52 shortly out of town and cross the Animas\nRiver. There are several campsite locations along this road. Follow the\nroad left when it forks slightly and take the hard 90 deg left at the\ntop of a hill, then go right at the next intersection. Follow this road\nuntil it switchbacks sharply to go up toward Arrastra and Silver Lake.\nPark here. Driving up higher doesn't help for Woodchuck Creek and\ncomplicates turning around. In 2014, there was a rock too big to move in\nthe middle of the road higher up.</p>\n<p>Follow the old trail from the parking space toward Arrastra and hike\nup the old faint trail north of Woodchuck. You'll lose it here and\nthere, but if you see where it's headed from where you've parked your\ncar you'll be in good shape. When you get to the scree slope, cross it\nwithout gaining too much elevation. The trail continues on the opposite\nside; there's an overgrown bush that has blocked its view.</p>\n<p>Stop where you want to start your descent. There is a large mine\ntailing pile at the beginning of the technical section, however\ncanyoneers may wish to start higher upstream. While not especially deep,\nthere is a narrow slot that is easy to gain access to and may be fun to\nadd to the adventure.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>This descent has not been done yet.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>Simply reintersect the trail and walk 10min back to your car.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n",
