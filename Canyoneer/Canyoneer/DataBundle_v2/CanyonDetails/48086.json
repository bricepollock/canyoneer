  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>Be aware: Upper Lindsey Creek was overrun by the Eagle Creek wildfire\nin Sept 2017. While the area been reopened, use extreme caution when\ndescending the creek. Between landslides, fallen trees, and loose rocks,\nthis area may be extremely unstable and dangerous for years to come. The\ncanyon may have changed dramatically. Do not rely on the beta below\nbeing accurate. If you run the canyon, please update the beta.</p>\n<p>Lindsey Creek is a major drainage located between Shellrock Mountain\nand Mt. Defiance on the south side of the Columbia River Gorge. This\npage describes the upper section of the creek which has a superb set of\nnarrows and falls located between 700-1100ft elevation - with some 6+\ndrops in rapid succession. Be ready, however, for a long day out. The\nrelentless logjams and damage from the Eagle Creek Fire in 2017 may\ntarnish the allure of what would otherwise was a splendid canyon.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Shorter Version</strong> - For a shorter option that was not\noverrun by the Eagle Creek fire, check out <a href=\"Lower_Lindsey_Creek\"\ntitle=\"wikilink\">Lower Lindsey Creek</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>Short+ Version</strong> - For a slightly longer option that\ndoesn't enter as much of the burned area, take the \"early entrance\" and\ncombine Lindsey Creek Falls (R9 &amp; R10) with Lower Lindsey.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"watershed\">Watershed</h3>\n<p>Lindsey Creek drains a large part of the north face of Mt. Defiance,\nincluding North Lake and Bear Lake, and sports significant water into\nearly August and September. Lindsey is likely quite dangerous earlier in\nthe season. Hydraulics will be present at many of the falls in high\nwater conditions. There are a number of deep pools along the way.\nWatershed: 4.45mi^2.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<h3 id=\"directions\">Directions</h3>\n<p>Note: the parking area is ONLY accessible from I-84 traveling\neastbound. About 2.3mi past Wyeth (exit 51), park in a gravel pulloff\njust off the highway's shoulder. There is room for 4-5 vehicles. Be\naware: this trailhead comes up fast and is easy to miss when moving at\nspeed. Be ready for it. A gated powerline access track leads up from the\npulloff to a junction with the bike trail above (~2min). Do not block\nthe gate. This is the same trailhead for <a\nhref=\"http://ropewiki.com/Summit_Creek_(Oregon)\">Summit Creek</a>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you miss the pullout, you can also continue 1.5mi east to\nStarvation Creek (exit 55) and park there. Hike the paved bike path back\nwest for ~1.5mi. This approach takes about 20-30min one way.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"hiking_in\">Hiking In</h3>\n<p>From the pullout, walk past the gate and follow the powerline access\ntrack upwards, crossing the paved bike path along the way. Once under\nthe powerlines, bear left and follow the track on a rising traverse up\nto its end. There's a faint use trail here leading south into the woods\nhere, which drops onto an overgrown logging track. Follow the old road\ngrade south about two minutes and watch for a place where the user trail\ndrops down into Lindsey Creek to your left. This will likely be your\nexit.</p>\n<p>Follow the logging grade a short distance further, then break off to\nascend the ridge. (The road grade is overgrown and trying to follow it\nis more trouble than it's worth.) The ridge, however, is fairly open\nforest, but was hit hard by the Eagle Creek Fire.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Early Entrance</strong> - Once up the first steep-ish area,\ncontour left/south until you can find an easy way down to drop into the\ncreek above Lindsey Creek Falls.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Full Lindsey</strong> - Continue on up the ridge. One cannot\nreally get lost; when in doubt, go uphill. You'll cross the old road\ngrade which switchbacks up the ridge several times. Just keep going\nuntil the ridge starts to narrow up and eventually, around 1400', the\nslope angle becomes easier. Keep going along the ridge until about\n1700ft elevation. At this point, drop off the ridge to climber's left\nand make your way down on a southeasterly heading, losing some 600ft of\nelevation to reach the creek just above the narrows. It gets steep, but\nnever cliffs out (if you're in the right place). We dropped in around\nUTM 10 599136mE 5058768mN. If you drop into this point, you will be\nstarting at R3 below. Lindsey complete-ists will want to thrash their\nway 0.1mi upstream which will net you +2 waterfalls.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>R1: 6ft.</li>\n<li>R2: 40ft into a small bowl.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Continue downstream ~5min to reach the place where you dropped in.\nContinue downstream to the top of the narrows.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>R3: Descend short slide and cross pool to 20ft drop. This is the\nentrance to the narrows. Short walk to the next falls.</li>\n<li>R4: 60ft from boulder DCR. Rappel down between twin flows merging at\nthe bottom. Escape possible DCL.</li>\n<li>R5: 80ft direct, or 100ft dry rappel from tree high DCR into\nimpressive amphitheater. Walk downstream 200yrds to the next\nrappel.</li>\n<li>R6: Creek sluices through two pockets to a 20ft drop. Walk 200ft to\nthe next falls.</li>\n<li>R7: 25ft. Neat section of narrows below the falls.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Hike 0.1mi to the next rappel.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>R8: 30ft. Previously, there was a massive logjam atop the falls.\nPossible good place for a guided rappel to avoid the mess.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Below R8, the creek passes through some beautiful sections of bedrock\nto a couple of short steps.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Downclimb: 5ft &amp; 15ft DCR.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Below, significant tributary enters DCR. May be possible to escape\nDCR here up to overgrown logging grade on the east side of the\ncanyon.</p>\n<p>Hike downstream 0.5mi, climbing over innumerable logjams. Eventually\nthe canyon narrows up again. Just before this happens, watch for a user\ntrail DCR which may be a possible exit to the aforementioned road grade.\nIt's also possible to exit DCL up onto Lindsey Ridge just above R9.\n(This is the \"early entrance.\")</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Downclimb 10ft.</li>\n<li>R9: 15ft from log.</li>\n<li>Downclimb 10ft DCR or DCR. Walk a short distance.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>R10: <strong>Lindsey Falls</strong>. 45ft into a pool. A huge\nchockstone is situated atop the drop with the creek dividing around it;\nmost of the flow DCR. Anchored from a log DCL.\n<font color=\"red\"><strong>Beware a rope-eating groove on the DCL side of\nthe boulder.</strong></font> This falls is a good candidate for bolting\n(or possibly a redirect could be placed to keep the rappel rope out of\nthe crack).</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>Below Lindsey Falls, head downstream wherever is easiest. There's\noccasionally a bit of a user trail on DCL side of the creek as waterfall\nhunters visit R10 frequently. After about 10min downstream, the trail\ncuts away from the creek and it ascends back to the old logging grade\nwhere you started.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Alternatively, you can continue downstream to run <a\nhref=\"Lower_Lindsey_Creek\" title=\"wikilink\">Lower Lindsey\nCreek</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<p>None.</p>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<p><a\nhref=\"https://www.waterfallsnorthwest.com/waterfall/Lindsey-Creek-Falls-4000_NW_Waterfall_Survey:_Lindsey_Falls\"\ntitle=\"wikilink\">https://www.waterfallsnorthwest.com/waterfall/Lindsey-Creek-Falls-4000\nNW Waterfall Survey: Lindsey Falls</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n<p>Creek was likely first descended by Portland locals.</p>\n",
