Please see Red Tape before running this creek.<\/b><\/font>\n<\/p><p>Souther Creek is a small drainage located between the towns of Stevenson and Carson on the north shore of the Columbia River Gorge.  It has a couple of good sized waterfalls that makes for a short adventure.  Flow can be extreme during the winter run-off but reduces to a trickle in late summer.  Best is probably during spring conditions with decent flow.\n<\/p><p>The approach requires some navigation and bushwhacking through a poison oak infested forest.  Long pants\/sleeves recommended.\n<\/p>\n<ul><li>Watershed: 1.6mi^2. The highest point of he drainage is about 2300ft elevation.<\/li><\/ul>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Check point:  Walk in a short distance to check the flow on Sweeney Falls.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading3\"><h3 id=\"Directions\">Directions<\/h3><\/div>\n<p>From Bridge of the Gods, head east on Hwy 14 for ~5mi.  At a sharp bend where Hwy 14 crosses Souther Creek, park in a large unsigned pullout on the north side of the highway.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading3\"><h3 id=\"Hike_In\">Hike In<\/h3><\/div>\n<p>From the pullout, walk east along Hwy 14 for 0.1mi to the next drainage east.  Spot an unsigned gate blocking an overgrown road.  Bypass the gate and follow the logging road up.  At a split in the road take the left branch to its end then do some easy bushwacking downwards to the creek while doing your best to avoid the poison oak.  Enter the creek at approx. UTM 10 589750mE 5062697mN.  It should be a gentle ramp all the way into the creek.  Just upstream is a short mossy narrows and sizeable pool which makes a good poison oak rinse-off station.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Head downstream about 5-10min to the top of R1.  There is a short waterslide into a shallow pool along the way.\n<\/p>\n<ul><li>R1:  <i>Crayfish Falls<\/i>.  80ft from a tree back right.  Interestingly the creek is starting to carve out a new fissure (too small to enter) DCL of the falls.<\/li><\/ul>\n<p>Downclimb 10ft after the bottom of the falls and continue 5-10 minutes to R2.\n<\/p>\n<ul><li>R2:  <i>Sweeney Falls<\/i>.  110ft from a tree on left.  The anchor tree appears to be levitating because it is L shape.  The falls drop down an elongated ramp, then turns right dumping into a fan-fall.  A 200 foot rope will barely get the job done if you stay right and out of the flow on the lower tier and reach up for the pull.  <font color=\"red\">Beware pendulum potential due to the shape of the falls.<\/font>  Will be rooster tails in high flow.  Falls can be bypassed via a user-trail DCR.<\/li><\/ul>\n<p>Take a minute below the falls to explore the mining tunnel that's bored back some 70ft into the bedrock on canyon right.  Sometimes bats and giant scary cave-crickets are found herein.\n<\/p><p>R2 is featured in a number of hiking guidebooks and unfortunately collects trash.  Please help keep the area clean by packing out any trash you encounter.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>5 minutes on an obvious trail DCR of the creek that begins at the bottom of R2.  Sometimes there's a fixed rope hanging down to expedite exit from the drainage back up to Hwy 14.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Red_tape\">Red tape<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>As of 2020, a logging operation is underway on both sides of Souther Creek near the mouth.  Numerous \"no trespassing\" signs have gone up.  While people have been visiting these falls for many years, an examination of Skamania County property lines reveals the lower end of Souther Creek is indeed on private land.  It would be best to first obtain permission from the land owners before running Souther Creek.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Beta_sites\">Beta sites<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Background\">Background<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Creek was probably first descended by Portland locals.\n<\/p>\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nParsed by mw‐api‐ext.codfw.main‐6779cc57fc‐pwh8d\nCached time: 20240914191853\nCache expiry: 2592000\nReduced expiry: false\nComplications: [show‐toc]\nCPU time usage: 0.007 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.009 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 29\/1000000\nPost‐expand include size: 0\/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 0\/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 2\/100\nExpensive parser function count: 0\/500\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0\/20\nUnstrip post‐expand size: 0\/5000000 bytes\nNumber of Wikibase entities loaded: 0\/400\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%    0.000      1 -total\n-->\n<\/div>","rappelLongestMeters":33.53,"timeRating":"II","technicalRating":3,"riskRating":null,"permit":"Restricted","waterRating":"C1","latitude":45.7107,"longitude":-121.8463,"quality":2.4,"id":47700,"vehicle":"Passenger","name":"Souther Creek","rappelCountMin":2,"version":"18225355df5bb701211fbf7cf81609a26c1dee27bd895a4f83175a1a0e7d6d27","geojson":{"type":"FeatureCollection","features":[{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"coordinates":[[-121.84305667877197,45.70924357450638,0],[-121.84138298034668,45.70994781282599,0],[-121.84108257293701,45.71032240406174,0],[-121.84086799621582,45.71062207524282,0],[-121.84099674224854,45.71089177793201,0],[-121.84121131896973,45.7107269597766,0],[-121.84144735336304,45.710592108197005,0],[-121.8418550491333,45.71053217405721,0],[-121.84200525283813,45.71017256786873,0],[-121.84254169464111,45.710127616932475,0],[-121.84284210205078,45.710157584227325,0],[-121.8427562713623,45.71042728915788,0],[-121.84316396713257,45.71062207524282,0],[-121.84382915496826,45.71075692675009,0],[-121.84434413909912,45.710741943265354,0],[-121.84460163116455,45.71084682757419,0],[-121.8447732925415,45.710936728253685,0],[-121.84537410736084,45.71089177793201,0],[-121.8457818031311,45.710966695114706,0],[-121.84621095657349,45.7110715790018,0],[-121.84655427932739,45.7112963295256,0],[-121.84676885604858,45.71146114600202,0],[-121.84687614440918,45.71158101222506,0]],"type":"LineString"},"properties":{"name":"Approach"}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"name":"Descent"},"geometry":{"coordinates":[[-121.84691905975342,45.71156602896123,0],[-121.84696197509766,45.71132629619384,0],[-121.8464469909668,45.71078689370753,0],[-121.8459963798523,45.71044227272699,0],[-121.84569597244263,45.71021751876879,0],[-121.84558868408203,45.71000774759244,0],[-121.84563159942627,45.70984292683011,0],[-121.8453311920166,45.70960318667183,0],[-121.8449878692627,45.709363445485266,0],[-121.84468746185303,45.70928852615358,0],[-121.84458017349243,45.70934846162697,0],[-121.84423685073853,45.709333477764645,0],[-121.84363603591919,45.70937842933955,0],[-121.84329271316528,45.709363445485266,0],[-121.84324979782104,45.709258558392804,0],[-121.84324979782104,45.709258558392804,0],[-121.84314250946045,45.70919862282303,0]],"type":"LineString"}},{"properties":{"name":"Crayfish Falls"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[[-121.84569597244263,45.71008266596009,0]]}},{"properties":{"name":"Enter Creek"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"coordinates":[[-121.84687412010055,45.71158595952825,0]],"type":"Point"}},{"geometry":{"coordinates":[[-121.84113654381758,45.7102476137686,0]],"type":"Point"},"type":"Feature","properties":{"name":"Gate"}},{"properties":{"name":"Leave Road Grade"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[[-121.84485912322998,45.71090676137657,0]]}},{"geometry":{"coordinates":[[-121.84303522109985,45.70916865501401,0]],"type":"Point"},"properties":{"name":"Parking"},"type":"Feature"},{"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[[-121.84470891952515,45.70934846162697,0]]},"properties":{"name":"Sweeney Falls"},"type":"Feature"}]},"rappelCountMax":2}
