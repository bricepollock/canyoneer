  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p><font color=\"red\"><strong>(July 2020) Souther Creek is on private\nland and there's a logging operation underway on both sides of the creek\nas of 2021. Please see Red Tape before running this\ncreek.</strong></font></p>\n<p>Souther Creek is a small drainage located between the towns of\nStevenson and Carson on the north shore of the Columbia River Gorge. It\nhas a couple of good sized waterfalls that makes for a short adventure.\nFlow can be extreme during the winter run-off but reduces to a trickle\nin late summer. Best is probably during spring conditions with decent\nflow.</p>\n<p>The approach requires some navigation and bushwhacking through a\npoison oak infested forest. Long pants/sleeves recommended.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Watershed: 1.6mi^2. The highest point of he drainage is about 2300ft\nelevation.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>Check point: Walk in a short distance to check the flow on Sweeney\nFalls.</p>\n<h3 id=\"directions\">Directions</h3>\n<p>From Bridge of the Gods, head east on Hwy 14 for ~5mi. At a sharp\nbend where Hwy 14 crosses Souther Creek, park in a large unsigned\npullout on the north side of the highway.</p>\n<h3 id=\"hike_in\">Hike In</h3>\n<p>From the pullout, walk east along Hwy 14 for 0.1mi to the next\ndrainage east. Spot an unsigned gate blocking an overgrown road. Bypass\nthe gate and follow the logging road up. At a split in the road take the\nleft branch to its end then do some easy bushwacking downwards to the\ncreek while doing your best to avoid the poison oak. Enter the creek at\napprox. UTM 10 589750mE 5062697mN. It should be a gentle ramp all the\nway into the creek. Just upstream is a short mossy narrows and sizeable\npool which makes a good poison oak rinse-off station.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>Head downstream about 5-10min to the top of R1. There is a short\nwaterslide into a shallow pool along the way.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>R1: <em>Crayfish Falls</em>. 80ft from a tree back right.\nInterestingly the creek is starting to carve out a new fissure (too\nsmall to enter) DCL of the falls.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Downclimb 10ft after the bottom of the falls and continue 5-10\nminutes to R2.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>R2: <em>Sweeney Falls</em>. 110ft from a tree on left. The anchor\ntree appears to be levitating because it is L shape. The falls drop down\nan elongated ramp, then turns right dumping into a fan-fall. A 200 foot\nrope will barely get the job done if you stay right and out of the flow\non the lower tier and reach up for the pull. <font color=\"red\">Beware\npendulum potential due to the shape of the falls.</font> Will be rooster\ntails in high flow. Falls can be bypassed via a user-trail DCR.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Take a minute below the falls to explore the mining tunnel that's\nbored back some 70ft into the bedrock on canyon right. Sometimes bats\nand giant scary cave-crickets are found herein.</p>\n<p>R2 is featured in a number of hiking guidebooks and unfortunately\ncollects trash. Please help keep the area clean by packing out any trash\nyou encounter.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>5 minutes on an obvious trail DCR of the creek that begins at the\nbottom of R2. Sometimes there's a fixed rope hanging down to expedite\nexit from the drainage back up to Hwy 14.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<p>As of 2020, a logging operation is underway on both sides of Souther\nCreek near the mouth. Numerous \"no trespassing\" signs have gone up.\nWhile people have been visiting these falls for many years, an\nexamination of Skamania County property lines reveals the lower end of\nSouther Creek is indeed on private land. It would be best to first\nobtain permission from the land owners before running Souther Creek.</p>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n<p>Creek was probably first descended by Portland locals.</p>\n",
