{"technicalRating":3,"permit":"No","name":"The Perch (West Fork Oak Creek)","description":"<div class=\"mw-content-ltr mw-parser-output\" lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><p>The Perch &gt; West Fork Az. A technical drainage dropping off steep on the north side of Westfork. This is a dry canyon so it can be done up until the gates are closed for the winter. This 3A III canyon is one out of three so far we scouted, did a first descent with Ken B. and Todd H. and named. All raps have natural anchors.\n<\/p><p>This particular drainage drops off steep from up top and the rappels come pretty quick one after the other with very short hikes in between each drop. These shorter canyons can be done up until the gates are closed for the winter. (no wetsuits required). Keep far right when entering oak creek for less bushwacking.\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Take 535 in off of 89A to 535A left to the parking area at the large clearing and start the approach there.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Anywhere from 3 to 5 hrs\n<\/p><p><b>R1<\/b> 120ft off large pine tree\n<\/p><p><b>R2<\/b> 30ft (optional down climb) \n<\/p><p><b>R3<\/b> 165ft\n<\/p><p><b>R4<\/b> 30ft (optional down climb)\n<\/p><p><b>R5<\/b> 300ft (tree anchor on DCR provides an easier pull)\n<\/p><p><b>R6<\/b> 20ft (anchor is  25' back) \n<\/p><p><b>R7<\/b> 50ft off small oak trees on DCL (optional 20ft down climb)\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>A loop is now in place as the map shows.
