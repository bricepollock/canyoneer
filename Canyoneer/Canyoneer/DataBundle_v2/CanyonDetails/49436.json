Alec was probably run for the first time in August 2017 and proved to be an okay creek, but not a spectacular one.  The drainage loses some allure per the numerous logjams that one has to climb over\/under\/around\/through.  there are long walks between the rappels and a number of them could probably be bypassed.  Alec has good access both at the top and bottom.  There is evidence that Alec can see extremely high water early in the season.  There are better options in the neighborhood, however.\n<\/p><p>A good checkpoint is from the bridge on FR 90 over Alec Creek.\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading3\"><h3 id=\"Shuttle\">Shuttle<\/h3><\/div>\n<p>From the Lewis River trailhead:  Head back west on FR 90 for 0.2mi and turn right\/north on FR 93.  Drive up past the Horse Camp for 0.9mi before turning off left on an unnamed forest road past a defunct gate.  Drive up the road for 0.8mi and park at a junction.  There is room for several vehicles just off the road at the junction.  Drive-time:  5-10min.\n<\/p>\n<ul><li>If you only have one car, drop it at the Lewis River Trailhead and hike instead.  It's possible to take a slight shortcut via the Quartz Creek Trail.  Take teh first left which leads up into the Horse Campground.  From there, just hike the road to the aforementioned junction.<\/li><\/ul>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading3\"><h3 id=\"Dropping_into_the_creek\">Dropping into the creek<\/h3><\/div>\n<p>Drop west off the road and hike down through relatively easy open forest until you reach Alec Creek below.  The upper part of the creek seems to be a somewhat swampy area.  We headed downstream maybe 0.1mi (easiest hiking seems to be in the creek) until the braided sections of creek merge.  There are a number of gravel bars which make a good place to suit wetsuit up.  On a hot day with low water, one could probably get away without a wetsuit on this one.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Continue downstream, climbing over and bypassing various obstacles.  Pass through a large boulder garden.  There are an inordinate number of logjams in this creek... result of old logging further upstream?\n<\/p>\n<ul><li>12ft step into a swimmer.  Rappel or downclimb DCL.  A gigantic log hangs over the creek below that has been dubbed <i>The Spear of Zeus<\/i>.<\/li><\/ul>\n<ul><li>R1:  50ft.  Use caution approaching the brink as the logjam atop the falls may not be entirely stable.  The logjam forms something of a \"false floor\" over a cave-like space underneath the falls.  Punching through would be Really Bad.  We looked at several options for rappelling and eventually elected to climb out of the creek DCL and anchor off a tree atop a house-sized boulder.  The rappel drops through a narrow body-width chasm between two gigantic boulders and then opens out into the cave underneath the falls with water pouring down all around.  Fun rappel.  Walk out, passing through the falls and carefully downclimb a couple of short steps to exit.<\/li><\/ul>\n<ul><li>R2:  20ft step on the creek.  Anchored off a tree DCR.  Drop likely could be bypassed.<\/li><\/ul>\n<p>The next two drops come in quick succession down under a logjam.  We ran them as two rappels, but it might be feasible to combine them from the same anchor.\n<\/p>\n<ul><li>R3:  10ft step under some logs to chest deep pool.<\/li>\n<li>R4:  8ft step.  Probably could be downclimbed?  Handline might be nice for some security.<\/li><\/ul>\n<ul><li>R5:  20ft.  Running the falls direct is an awkward start as there's a slight channel atop the falls, then it goes free hanging underneath.  Beware a potential rope-eater at the top of the falls.  Landing is in a deep beautiful emerald-green pool of clear water.<\/li><\/ul>\n<p>After hiking some distance, reach a long stretch of bedrock and easy walking.  Not far ahead is FR 90 bridge which is a sign the end of the canyon is drawing near.  There's some great bedrock and pools under the bridge.\n<\/p>\n<ul><li>R6: <i>Alec Creek Falls<\/i> - 40ft.  Two tier falls;  anchored off a rock mid-creek.  First tier has a slightly awkward start, then a nice water slide below.  Walk a short horizontal distance and descend the second tier into a swimmer.<\/li><\/ul>\n<p>Reach a big logjam below R6.  In 2017 it was possible to bypass DCL doing a couple of easy slides down bare bedrock undeneath the jam.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Keep going downstream until you reach the hiker's bridge (aka maintained Lewis River Trail) over Alec Creek.  Exit the creek DCR, cross the bridge, and follow the trail east up past the Upper Falls and Taitnapum Falls on the Lewis River.  Just before the trail crosses FR90, you'll reach a junction.  Bear left for 1min to your car at the lower trailhead.  Hike time:  5-10min.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Red_tape\">Red tape<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Starting in 2021: between June 15 and Sept 30, a permit is required to park along a 14mi stretch of FR 90.
