  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>Another lesser tributary of the Lewis River located just west of the\nLewis River Horse Camp. Alec was probably run for the first time in\nAugust 2017 and proved to be an okay creek, but not a spectacular one.\nThe drainage loses some allure per the numerous logjams that one has to\nclimb over/under/around/through. there are long walks between the\nrappels and a number of them could probably be bypassed. Alec has good\naccess both at the top and bottom. There is evidence that Alec can see\nextremely high water early in the season. There are better options in\nthe neighborhood, however.</p>\n<p>A good checkpoint is from the bridge on FR 90 over Alec Creek.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<h3 id=\"shuttle\">Shuttle</h3>\n<p>From the Lewis River trailhead: Head back west on FR 90 for 0.2mi and\nturn right/north on FR 93. Drive up past the Horse Camp for 0.9mi before\nturning off left on an unnamed forest road past a defunct gate. Drive up\nthe road for 0.8mi and park at a junction. There is room for several\nvehicles just off the road at the junction. Drive-time: 5-10min.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you only have one car, drop it at the Lewis River Trailhead and\nhike instead. It's possible to take a slight shortcut via the Quartz\nCreek Trail. Take teh first left which leads up into the Horse\nCampground. From there, just hike the road to the aforementioned\njunction.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"dropping_into_the_creek\">Dropping into the creek</h3>\n<p>Drop west off the road and hike down through relatively easy open\nforest until you reach Alec Creek below. The upper part of the creek\nseems to be a somewhat swampy area. We headed downstream maybe 0.1mi\n(easiest hiking seems to be in the creek) until the braided sections of\ncreek merge. There are a number of gravel bars which make a good place\nto suit wetsuit up. On a hot day with low water, one could probably get\naway without a wetsuit on this one.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>Continue downstream, climbing over and bypassing various obstacles.\nPass through a large boulder garden. There are an inordinate number of\nlogjams in this creek... result of old logging further upstream?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>12ft step into a swimmer. Rappel or downclimb DCL. A gigantic log\nhangs over the creek below that has been dubbed <em>The Spear of\nZeus</em>.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>R1: 50ft. Use caution approaching the brink as the logjam atop the\nfalls may not be entirely stable. The logjam forms something of a \"false\nfloor\" over a cave-like space underneath the falls. Punching through\nwould be Really Bad. We looked at several options for rappelling and\neventually elected to climb out of the creek DCL and anchor off a tree\natop a house-sized boulder. The rappel drops through a narrow body-width\nchasm between two gigantic boulders and then opens out into the cave\nunderneath the falls with water pouring down all around. Fun rappel.\nWalk out, passing through the falls and carefully downclimb a couple of\nshort steps to exit.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>R2: 20ft step on the creek. Anchored off a tree DCR. Drop likely\ncould be bypassed.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The next two drops come in quick succession down under a logjam. We\nran them as two rappels, but it might be feasible to combine them from\nthe same anchor.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>R3: 10ft step under some logs to chest deep pool.</li>\n<li>R4: 8ft step. Probably could be downclimbed? Handline might be nice\nfor some security.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>R5: 20ft. Running the falls direct is an awkward start as there's a\nslight channel atop the falls, then it goes free hanging underneath.\nBeware a potential rope-eater at the top of the falls. Landing is in a\ndeep beautiful emerald-green pool of clear water.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>After hiking some distance, reach a long stretch of bedrock and easy\nwalking. Not far ahead is FR 90 bridge which is a sign the end of the\ncanyon is drawing near. There's some great bedrock and pools under the\nbridge.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>R6: <em>Alec Creek Falls</em> - 40ft. Two tier falls; anchored off a\nrock mid-creek. First tier has a slightly awkward start, then a nice\nwater slide below. Walk a short horizontal distance and descend the\nsecond tier into a swimmer.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Reach a big logjam below R6. In 2017 it was possible to bypass DCL\ndoing a couple of easy slides down bare bedrock undeneath the jam.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>Keep going downstream until you reach the hiker's bridge (aka\nmaintained Lewis River Trail) over Alec Creek. Exit the creek DCR, cross\nthe bridge, and follow the trail east up past the Upper Falls and\nTaitnapum Falls on the Lewis River. Just before the trail crosses FR90,\nyou'll reach a junction. Bear left for 1min to your car at the lower\ntrailhead. Hike time: 5-10min.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<p>Starting in 2021: between June 15 and Sept 30, a permit is required\nto park along a 14mi stretch of FR 90. Parking in this area is limited\nto one of six different recreational sites. Permits are available from\n<a href=\"https://www.recreation.gov/\">recreation.gov</a>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Map of the restricted parking area: <a\nhref=\"https://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/fseprd910851.pdf\"><span>https://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/fseprd910851.pdf</span></a></li>\n<li>The best parking areas for Alec Creek are the Lewis River Horse Camp\nor Upper Falls.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n<p>Creek was first run by Kendra Kallevig and Kevin Clark on Aug 26,\n2017.</p>\n",
