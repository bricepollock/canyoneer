  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>A nice creek that drains a small plateau located between Cape Horn\nand Archer Mountain. The plateau is locally known as the Cruzatt Rim.\nThere are at least five significant waterfalls on the creek. While the\nbig falls are impressive with good water, there is a fairly long\napproach, requiring bushwhacking and knowledge of local trails. Access\nis difficult as there's a lot of private property in the area.</p>\n<p>Watershed: 0.35mi^2.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>R0: 30ft. Optional falls which is easily missed if descending along\nthe ridge. At the bottom, bushwhack downstream 100yrds to R1. May need a\nmachete to get through the brush.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Prindle Falls</em> is approx. 250ft and is done in two stages (R2\n&amp; R3).</p>\n<ul>\n<li>R1: 120ft from a cairn mid-creek to a large platform mid-falls.\nEvaluate the flow carefully before committing to this rappel. It may be\nwiser to use a different anchor in high flow. Also, beware rockfall on\nthis pitch. There are a number of small rocks in the creek just above\nthe drop which can be knocked down by a rappeller or moving rope. Anyone\nat the bottom should stay well back from the base of the pitch. The rope\nis best pulled from up out of the water DCR. It can be advantageous to\nhave someone rappel and get off at the anchor for R2.</li>\n<li>R2: 130ft from a small tree high DCL. This anchor requires a short\nscramble to reach and will keep you in the flow all the way down. At the\nbottom, it may be easier to pull the rope from further downstream.</li>\n<li>Downclimb the short drop below R3 or rappel from a log.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It's a short walk to the next falls.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>R3: 120ft into a beautiful amphitheater from a bolt station DCR. Use\ncaution approaching the anchor. (N.B. The rock quality atop this pitch\nis extremely poor, so pay special attention when assessing the anchor.)\nBeware rockfall on this pitch.</li>\n<li>R4: Downclimb to a giant log mid-creek and rappel two short drops\n(highest maybe 35ft) to the bottom. 100ft of rope (SRT) is required per\nthe horizontal distance. The falls can also be bypassed far DCL.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Prindle Mountain is largely surrounded by private property, making\naccess difficult. Ryan-Tavelli Road looks like the best approach, but it\nbecomes a driveway to a private home atop Prindle. The main gate at the\nfoot of the hill is so large that you'd probably have a hard time\ngetting in even if you showed up with a bulldozer.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Descending directly from the last falls to Hwy 14 will put you on\nprivate property. Don't go that way. Reportedly, one party was chased\noff by hostile locals.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a\nhref=\"https://www.oregonhikers.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=10&amp;t=6540&amp;sid=38b0f683e8c01c5b1ff9e7783e651064&amp;start=10\">Oregonhikers\ntrip report</a></li>\n<li><a\nhref=\"http://www.oregonhikers.org/archive/view/17306\">Oregonhikers\narchived trip report</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n<p>First complete descent by Portland locals in May 2018.</p>\n"
