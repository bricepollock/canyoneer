Second part a bit more commited and cut\nin, but not the nicest limestone.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>From the parking walk up the path to Miex, from there it goes down a\nfew meters before reaching the start of the canyon.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>At the start you walk 100m, followed by 2 rappels in nice pools (not\ndeep) before it gets less interesting. On the lower part, 7 rappels of\n10-30m not completely vertical through the deepest section of the\ncanyon. In between there is a 500m walk.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>5 min of walking in the riverbed before reaching the hiking trail.\nFrom there another 15min to get back to the car.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<p>Picture Credit : Alex Arnold</p>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n<p>One of the new canyons in the regions, first descent in october\n2021.</p>\n",
