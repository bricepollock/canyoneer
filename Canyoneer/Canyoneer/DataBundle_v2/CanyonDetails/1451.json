Can be dry (there is a dam upstream) but will flow throughout the spring and in higher water years.\n<\/p><p>There is one road leading to the entrance\/exit of this canyon (Eagle Peak rd, accessed via Julian). The road navigation programs might try to take you on from Poway is currently (2024) closed. The road connecting to the three sister's trailhead is blocked by a gate and closed. To do this as a combo with Boulder Creek as previously suggested would require backtracking and add significantly more drive time to the trip than it might be worth.\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>As you drive down the dirt road you will see Ritchie canyon meandering down on your right. Park at the Matthew Pack Memorial (white cross), then it is a short, easy walk into the canyon.\n<\/p><p>There are several animal paths and straightforward ways to navigate to and access the top of the canyon. From your car, head to the right and follow the ridgeline. If you drop down directly over the ridgeline, you will arrive near the top of Mildred Falls. If you continue to the right, you will drop down about a 5-10 minute walk before the falls and need to negotiate a little bit more of the creek. Both entrances are relatively the same length, difficulty, and time commitment.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading3\"><h3 id=\"Upstream_of_Mildred_Falls\">Upstream of Mildred Falls<\/h3><\/div>\n<p><i>This section is bypassed by the direct approach<\/i>\n<\/p><p>The first obstacle is a short 20ft drop into a narrow pool that can easily be walked around LDC.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading3\"><h3 id=\"Mildred_Falls\">Mildred Falls<\/h3><\/div>\n<p>The view from the top of Mildred Falls is pretty amazing and you can't see any of the ledges, just the ground about 300 ft below you. This wall has very large blocks and ledges and you don't have a clear view of the bottom of the falls until the final pitch. Walkie-talkies are highly recommended on this wall. In water, communicating with whistles would be extremely difficult. There are two ways of descending this drop.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading4\"><h4 id=\"LDC_descent\">LDC descent<\/h4><\/div>\n<p>This descent is a 2 or 3 stage rappel mostly out of the watercourse under normal conditions. The LDC side has less abrasion risk, but station management should be actively used to switch wear spots if needed. If done in two stages, retrieve your top rope (R1) and pull the second stage (R2) as the pull from the first LDC anchor would be difficult. If you are doing either the 2 or 3 stage rappel, you should stay on rope and treat these as rebelay setups. The wall could be slick and while the ledges are large and comfortable, there is real risk of slipping and having a serious accident.\n<\/p><p><b>R1<\/b>: 150ft, anchored to 2 bolts LDC. (This rappel may be split up into two rappels of roughly 70' using a set of bolts on the first large and obvious ledge in the canyon.) A 200ft rope is good for this first rappel. You won't be able to see the ledge for rappel 2 until you are over the edge.\n<\/p><p><b>R2<\/b>: 250ft, anchored off 2 bolts LDC.  The ledge here is large and you can sit several people at a well-managed anchor. Be careful not to kick rocks over the edge as you go over. There are 2 more ledges on the way down and finally a nice free-hang near the bottom (100 feet) so it might be a good idea to hang your pack.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading4\"><h4 id=\"RDC_descent\">RDC descent<\/h4><\/div>\n<p>This descent is a single long rappel directly in the water course requiring at least 300ft of rope; it is the more difficult and dangerous of the two options.\n<\/p><p><b>R1<\/b>: 300ft  directly in the watercourse, anchored to bolts RDC.

It was not descended with this amount of water and is NOT recommended. It was to see location of anchors under higher flow. The lime green dot shows a good alternate first anchor. This puts you further away from the flow, since the top anchor was almost covered in water under these conditions. The red dots show the EXACT location of the bolted stations, so it is very much possible to avoid the water, up until the bottom when it overhangs. The yellow dot shows a ledge that is possible to get off on, traverse DCL and start making your way up the exit trail. A 300' rope will reach from the top, with an extended anchor (~15') to this ledge, with roughly 10' extra. Be very careful if getting off on this ledge when wet, and be sure not to go past it. A full single line descent would require at least 350' of rope if you wish to go past this ledge and all the way to the bottom. A 200' rope should suffice from the larger ledge (3rd red dot) all the way to the bottom but has NOT been attempted.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>There are two possible exits from the canyon.

It's a ranch upstream a little with a few ponds that can also control the flow of the creek and hence the falls. He explained there was <a href=\"#Background\">a guy who died on the falls<\/a> and SAR asked him to \"turn off the water\". It was moving pretty fast so he could only stop it for 10 minutes.
