  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>Caltech canyon is a subsidiary to Eaton flowing between Muir and\nMarkham, directly across from Harvard Branch. Best January through June,\nbefore it drys up. Flash flood warning- narrow spots with no escape. It\nis more of an option for those who have already completed lower Eaton\nbefore.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>1)Continue on Idlehour trail from Idlehour to Caltech canyon crossing\n*only if interested in the Idlehour trail above Eaton</p>\n<p>2)Trace the canyon upward from the confluence with Eaton *most\npractical though strenuous</p>\n<p>3)Rappel into the canyon from Mount Markham elev 3100(downhill of\nsubpeak 3513)*best route To accomplish this scramble up the scree slope\nupstream of Idlehour camp above a small falls(not visible from\ntrail).... and ending the scrambling at the right of the rock promotory\nof the slope.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>8 drops, with 2 cascades less than 10ft, all but Calteach falls can\nbe downclimbed. The tallest is Caltech canyon falls at 60ft(67 ft from\nanchor). This optional rap can be downclimbed DCR. All of the drops\noccur near the end of the canyon.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>The canyon finishes yards downstream of Idlehour camp at Eaton creek.\nThe exit time would likely be 1.5 hours to exit via the Eaton approach\ntrail to the Conservation area where the shuttle car would be placed, or\nanother 3-5 hours to exit via Lower Eaton Canyon.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<p>If Caltech is used as an alternate approach to descending Eaton,\npermits no longer required for the Eaton segment</p>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a\nhref=\"http://sangabrielmnts.myfreeforum.org/about5352.html\">http://sangabrielmnts.myfreeforum.org/about5352.html</a></li>\n<li><a\nhref=\"http://s2.photobucket.com/user/nighteyes1234/library/Caltech%20canyon%20Feb10\">http://s2.photobucket.com/user/nighteyes1234/library/Caltech%20canyon%20Feb10</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n",
