It may be short in distance, but it offers jumps, slides, and a terrific big rappel sequence in the flow.

The canyon is likely spring-fed and receives very little direct sunlight in the depths. Water levels can be high even late summer; make sure to check the flow conditions before you attempt the canyon and be prepared to back off. Unfortunately, the reference waterfall can only really be viewed by using a drone.
