  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>A tributary of the Lewis River on the north-northwest side of Indian\nHeaven. The uppermost drop is Little Niagara which is one of the most\nphotogenic waterfalls in Gifford Pinchot National Forest. Despite being\nlocated out in the middle of nowhere, this falls is frequently visited\nby enthusiastic waterfall photographers. Tillicum Creek drains a good\npart of the northern end of the Indian Heaven plateau, so it sees good\nflow well into late summer.</p>\n<p>Options:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Descend R1 &amp; R2 and exit for a short outing. Requires just a few\nhours.</li>\n<li>Full descent - expect it to take most of a day.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>Check Gifford Pinchot NF website for road conditions. As of Aug 2017,\nFR88 is completely washed out / not passable near Jct 3022.</p>\n<p>Facing south from the parking area, look on your right for a flagged\nuser-trail that leads right down to the top of the falls. This is the\nfastest and easiest route. Trail is a little indistinct in a couple\nareas near the bottom. Approach: 2min.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It's also possible to stream-walk down from the bridge. Some nice\nbedrock, but otherwise doesn't buy you anything.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<h3 id=\"upper_tillicum\">Upper Tillicum</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>R1: <em>Little Niagara Falls</em> - 100ft. DCL on tree. More rope\nmay be required depending on where your anchor is. Please do not leave\nanchors atop this falls as it's frequently visited by tourists. Use a\nretrievable or return to the top of the falls at the end of the day to\nremove your anchor. Leaving anchors may encourage the inexperienced /\nunprepared to try to follow you. Hugely photogenic falls; see cover\nphoto.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Escape is possible from below R1 by thrashing steeply up and out DCR.\nHead downstream a hundred yards to R2.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>R2: <em>Tillicum Falls</em> - 40ft. Anchored off a fallen log DCR.\nLog is part of a big logjam atop the falls. Rap line will keep you\nmostly out of the flow. There is a nice grotto below the falls. Walk\ndown another 100ft where a minor tributary (\"Lower Tillicum Creek\")\nenters DCL. There is a 20ft low-flow falls visible just upstream.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It is possible to exit below R2 (see \"Exit\" below).</p>\n<h3 id=\"lower_tillicum\">Lower Tillicum</h3>\n<p>Otherwise, continue 0.5mi downstream.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>R3 and R4: 50ft and 80ft anchored by a tree DCR. This is in the flow\nand can be quite pushy. Once you make it to the top area of the 2nd tier\nthere is an anchor DCR off of a nice set of roots.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Continue 0.3mi downstream.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>R5 KeyHole Falls - 50 ft. DCL off of a tree above the mini-zen\npocket. Rappel is just out of the flow.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>R6 Tempest Falls- 85 ft into a nice, deep pool. DCR off of a tree.\nThis drop is especially nice.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<h3 id=\"from_below_r2\">From Below R2</h3>\n<p>Head downstream a few hundred yards from Tillicum Falls. Duck under\ntwo huge old-growth trees spanning the creek exit DCR up into a small\narea of open forest. Just to climber's left a steep tributary enters.\nLook for a faint unmarked user trail that heads steeply upwards on the\nclimber's right side of the tributary with one or two scramble moves.\nThe route stays in relatively open forest with a bare minimum of\nbushwhacking. After about 3-5min you'll run right into an old hiking\ntrail that runs along the north side of Tillicum Creek. Follow the trail\nto your right through some nice old growth trees. The trail leads right\nback up to the parking area. The trail comes in right at the north side\nof the parking area. The trail may be hard to spot from the parking\narea, but is pretty solid.</p>\n<h3 id=\"from_full_descent\">From Full Descent</h3>\n<p>Go downstream about 100 feet and exit DCR up to an old road that\nconnect to FR321. This road will take you to FR32 and back to your\nvehicle. A shuttle would be a good and quick way to save an hour walking\nthe 2+mi back to your car.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<p>None.</p>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<p><a\nhref=\"https://www.waterfallsnorthwest.com/waterfall/Little-Niagara-Falls-5254\">NW\nWaterfall Survey - Little Niagara Falls</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<p><a\nhref=\"https://youtu.be/S52ja-45Y8g\">https://youtu.be/S52ja-45Y8g</a></p>\n<p>detailed vid for this canyon</p>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n<p>First descent of the top two falls 8/13/17: Keith Campbell, Kevin\nClark, Kaitlin Rupert, Kendra Kallevig-Childers, Joe Kellett, and Mark\nMeyer.
