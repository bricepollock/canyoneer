The uppermost drop is Little Niagara which is one of the most photogenic waterfalls in Gifford Pinchot National Forest.  Despite being located out in the middle of nowhere, this falls is frequently visited by enthusiastic waterfall photographers.   Tillicum Creek drains a good part of the northern end of the Indian Heaven plateau, so it sees good flow well into late summer.\n<\/p><p>Options:\n<\/p>\n<ul><li>Descend R1 &amp; R2 and exit for a short outing.

This is the fastest and easiest route.  Trail is a little indistinct in a couple areas near the bottom.  Approach:  2min.\n<\/p>\n<ul><li>It's also possible to stream-walk down from the bridge.

DCL on tree. More rope may be required depending on where your anchor is.  Please do not leave anchors atop this falls as it's frequently visited by tourists.  Use a retrievable or return to the top of the falls at the end of the day to remove your anchor.  Leaving anchors may encourage the inexperienced \/ unprepared to try to follow you.  Hugely photogenic falls;  see cover photo.<\/li><\/ul>\n<p>Escape is possible from below R1 by thrashing steeply up and out DCR.

Rap line will keep you mostly out of the flow.  There is a nice grotto below the falls.  Walk down another 100ft where a minor tributary (\"Lower Tillicum Creek\") enters DCL.

Duck under two huge old-growth trees spanning the creek exit DCR up into a small area of open forest.  Just to climber's left a steep tributary enters.  Look for a faint unmarked user trail that heads steeply upwards on the climber's right side of the tributary with one or two scramble moves.  The route stays in relatively open forest with a bare minimum of bushwhacking.  After about 3-5min you'll run right into an old hiking trail that runs along the north side of Tillicum Creek.  Follow the trail to your right through some nice old growth trees.  The trail leads right back up to the parking area.  The trail comes in right at the north side of the parking area.  The trail may be hard to spot from the parking area, but is pretty solid.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading3\"><h3 id=\"Full_Descent\">Full Descent<\/h3><\/div>\n<p>Go downstream about 100ft and exit DCR up to an old road that connects to FR 321.
