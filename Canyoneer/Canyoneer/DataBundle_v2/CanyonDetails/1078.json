It is a tributary of the Skagit River. Thornton Creek is sourced from Thornton Lakes—three alpine <a class=\"external text\" href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Paternoster_lake\">paternoster lakes<\/a> in a cirque below Mount Triumph's south ridge (which ends in a minor peak that has been called Thornton Peak) and Trappers Peak. It is one of the best canyons in the region and can be very challenging in high flow due to multistage rappels and hydraulics.\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading3\"><h3 id=\"The_Sections\">The Sections<\/h3><\/div>\n<p>Thornton can be broken down into 3 sections.\n<\/p>\n<ul><li><b>The Classic Section<\/b> - This can be considered the \"middle\" of the canyon. It runs from where an old forest road crosses the canyon (at ~1334ft), down to the bridge.<\/li>\n<li><b>The Upper Section<\/b> - Since 2020 the canyon above the classic section has been developed. The upper canyon has a similar characteristic to the classic section, but it adds a considerable amount of distance and a lot more obstacles. Recommended for people who want a full day and know how to move efficiently through a canyon.<\/li>\n<li><b>The Lower section<\/b> - for anyone who reaches the bridge and wants to keep rapping, there's an option to continue all the way down to the highway.<\/li><\/ul>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Waterflow\">Waterflow<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>The waterflow checkpoint is the multistage rappel above the bridge. It is visible from the very short trail leading upstream from the bridge on DCL. The Bacon Creek stream gauge correlates well with the waterflow in Thornton Creek.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p><b>Shuttles:<\/b> depending on the particular flavor of Thornton your running you can use either the top trailhead, pullouts at the 4th switchback above the bridge, pullouts at the bridge itself, or the highway 20 pullout, to position your vehicles.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading3\"><h3 id=\"Upper_Section\">Upper Section<\/h3><\/div>\n<p>To access the start of the canyon take the Thornton Lakes Road and park at the Thornton Lakes Trailhead. You can either \"half suit\" up at the parking lot, or carry your wetsuit in your pack down to the entrance of the canyon. From the parking lot, head back toward the road, and look for pink flagging tape or a faint user trail on your left. If you find yourself walking down the road proper, you've gone too far. From here, follow the grade down, trending East-North-East until you reach the creek and find an easy way to enter the creek and a good spot to finish suiting up.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading3\"><h3 id=\"Classic_Section\">Classic Section<\/h3><\/div>\n<p>Take the Thornton Lakes Road up the mountain for 1.25 miles and park where the road makes a sharp left turn (and where the road is closest to the river). It's the 4th switch-back after the bridge.\n<\/p><p>Hike up the west rim of the canyon. At an elevation of 1380ft (48.65176, -121.31392) you'll meet an old forest road, which followed north-west will lead to the canyon.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading5\"><h5 id=\"Extra_Short_Classic_Option\">Extra Short Classic Option<\/h5><\/div>\n<p>If you're looking for an extra-short route follow the west rim of the canyon to an elevation of 1200 feet and drop in down a steep hillside.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p><b>Caution:<\/b> In higher water levels, canyoneers will be required to do a number of pothole escapes in hydraulics. Be aware that the rock is super slippery, the water is very cold, and some of the potholes do not have good handholds.  This requires mantling with the hands and doing a beached whale move to get up and out while on rappel. There are also many jumps and slides in this canyon, many of which require precise spotting. Someone experienced in the canyon is vital, or each will need a good spotter to check pools for depth and obstacles.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"rwwarningbox\"><b><\/b>\n<p>Thornton is a non-stop canyon, with back-to-back obstacles down its whole length. This makes it very difficult to document the descent in a way that can be easily followed. The following beta needs further verification &amp; refinement. Don't presume it's correct!
