Most of the water is channeled to a powerhouse downstream so the flow is fairly consistent most of the year at 90cfs (with occasional 2500cfs bursts in Spring). \n<\/p><p>This canyon is VERY high water, hence only for experience class C canyoneers! Although one can avoid all the turbulent hydraulics, you will be swimming in high velocity water and it is extremely important to plan trajectories ahead and avoid being swept by the strong flow or get entrapped in strainers.\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Park at the Toketee Falls trailhead and proceed for 5 minutes down the trail, which follows the edge of the river.

Then proceed down river through the gorge, mostly swimming.<\/li>\n<li>R2: Downclimb a small drop on the left, avoid the narrow sump on the right<\/li>\n<li>R3: Climb the rocky ledge DCR to reach a tree with webbing. Rappel from the tree down to a rock ledge then jump out in the middle of the stream. Stay on the center-left to avoid the strong hydraulics on canyon right. It is best to swim down to a semi submerged rock in the middle of the stream above the next drop and from there traverse to canyon left.<\/li>\n<li>R4: Downclimb a hairy ledge on canyon left to get down to the top tier of Toketee Falls<\/li>\n<li>R5: Rappel 20ft from a single bolt at the top of the rock wall on canyon left. Drop you down to a platform in the pool below, right next but out of reach of the strong hydraulics. Traverse the pool staying on canyon left, where current is minimal, and reach the edge of the final drop, where you will find another single bolt. NOTE: this edge is wet and slippery, so it is recommended to be roped up to approach the final bolt station.<\/li>\n<li>R6: Rappel 70ft from bolt DCL into the large pool below. You may have to go over some vegetation, but will land in a minimal current area right next to the big hydraulic. Pull down is hard from this point, better to extend the rope and do the pull down from the back of the pool that provides direct line of sight with the bolt station.<\/li><\/ul>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>From the final pool follow a use trail on canyon left that climbs up the steep side of the anphitheater with static ropes and steel cables until you reach the viewing platform of Tokette Falls.
