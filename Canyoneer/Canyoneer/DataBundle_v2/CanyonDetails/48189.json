  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>Be aware: Young Creek was hit by a spot-burn from the Eagle Creek\nwildfire in Sept 2017 and was closed for a significant period of time.\nPlease use extreme caution when approaching and descending the creek.\nThe local land managers request that no further bolts be added, but we\ncan replace whatever is currently there.</p>\n<p>Young Creek is a drainage located just west of Bridal Veil Creek in\nthe Columbia Gorge. The Historic Columbia River Highway (HCRH) crosses\nthe creek on a beautiful high bridge built in 1915. Signs denote this as\n“Shepperds Dell\". A very short paved trail with a neat stone walkway\nleads down to the top of one of the waterfalls (R5). However, there are\nfour more falls just upstream and two short drops located underneath the\nbridge. The bridge is conveniently located for assessing the flow rate\non the creek prior to committing to the canyon. The canyon sees\nsubstantially higher flow earlier in the season.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Beware poison oak, briars, and rockfall on the approach and\nexit.</li>\n<li>Use caution when walking along the road; it's narrow and there's\nlittle to no shoulder.</li>\n<li>Watershed: ~2.0mi^2.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<h3 id=\"directions\">Directions</h3>\n<p>Take I-84 to exit 28 (Bridal Veil). Turn right on the Old Columbia\nRiver Hwy and continue 1.7mi to a signed pullout for Shepperds Dell just\nbefore the bridge across Young Creek.</p>\n<h3 id=\"hike_in\">Hike In</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Original Approach</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>From the pullout, walk across the bridge and continue west along the\nroad a hundred yards to the next obvious drainage gully coming in on the\nsouth side. Break off the road here and thrash upwards about 200ft\nwherever is easiest. It’s steep, but goes relatively quickly. It's a\ngood idea to wear a helmet on the approach as this area has become\nrather unstable post-fire; beware knocking loose rocks on one another.\nHead for an obvious notch above, avoiding thickets of briars and poison\noak. Once through the notch, the terrain abruptly mellows out. Follow\nthe flat bench east until you reach the creek, now deeply entrenched\nbelow. Looking down from here you should be able to spot the top of R2\nwhere the creek abruptly drops into a narrow slot.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Shuttle Approach (unexplored)</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>It may be possible to shuttle up Alex Barr Road and hike/bushwhack\nnorth from the obvious switchback, staying on public land. Eventually,\nmeet the original route and follow it east to the creek. It's about\n0.3mi, losing some 600ft of elevation.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>The uppermost falls on Young Creek (12ft high) is located a few\nhundred yards upstream from the drop-in described above. This falls,\nhowever, is on private property, is unimpressive, and requires\nsignificant bushwhacking to reach. Not recommended.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>R1: Rappel 30ft from any convenient tree to enter the drainage. Look\nfor webbing on obvious tree.</li>\n<li>R2: 90ft into a calf-deep pool from a bolt station along the big\nwall high DCL. Pull is nice. You can engage flow as much or as little as\nyou’d like. Bolts can be overgrown; found up and to the left of the\nlanding from the obvious tree used for R1.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Below the pool, the creek enters a mossy V-slot with three short\ndrops (3-5ft) in quick succession. There is a nice shelf DCR that can be\nused to avoid the cluttered V-slot.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>R3 + traverse: 15ft traverse from a single bolt DCR to another\nsingle bolt DCR right on the brink. (Rigged as a rebelay in high water.)\nFrom the main anchor, it's 95ft to the bottom. Use caution when\ndeploying the rope as the bottom of this falls occasionally sees\nvisitors climbing up from below. This is the crux. At high flow, be\nprepared to stem over the torrent and use a narrow / almost unseen ledge\nDCR. Enter the flow quickly as the force will be very pushy. Be\nconfident in your high water skills for this. The station manager will\nnot be able to see anyone on the rope. Would be wise to use a bottom\nbelay from below. Use caution as there is some rockfall hazard on this\npitch.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>R4: 20ft from a large rock DCR or bypass DCR.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Below R4, downclimb to the railed pedestrian trail atop of R5. Escape\nis possible via the trail.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>R5: 60ft from the concrete post at the end of the pedestrian\nwalkway. The bottom of this rappel is the large amphitheater underneath\nthe bridge. When finished, go back and remove your webbing. (Please help\nus keep the amphitheater clean and pack out any garbage you might find\ndown there. Unfortunately, some idiots think it's okay to throw trash\noff the bridge.)</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>R6: 20ft from a large rock DCR. A house-sized boulder blocks the\nexit from the amphitheater. Rappel DCR in the flow, or DCL for out of\nthe water / less water.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>01/July/2023 - This rock is unstable and walks some - consider this a\nmarginal anchor. We had last rappeller sit on the rock until all others\nwere safely down; then last member repelled with a soft low start.</p>\n<p>A short downclimb exits the narrows. Make your way down the stream to\nthe railroad tracks.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>Walking along the railroad line is trespassing (not to mention trains\ncome barreling through here at 60mph with little to no warning), so stay\noff the tracks. Keep back in the woods and head west until you reach the\nnext gulley. Climb upwards wherever is easiest (avoiding thickets of\nbramble and briars) until you reach the wall below the old highway about\n100ft above. If you come up in the right spot there’s a nice\nperson-sized opening in the stone guardrail (seemingly designed for\ncanyoneers). Walk back east along the road to the bridge and your\ncar.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<p>Please stay on public land during the approach and exit.</p>\n<p>Canyoneers will be in full view from the bridge and pedestrian\nwalkway on the last two rappels. Canyoning is still not a well known\nactivity in the Columbia Gorge and it would be good not to linger overly\nlong or overstay your welcome. Please help pack out any trash you should\nencounter below the bridge and help leave the place cleaner than when\nyou found it. Please do not leave anchors in view of the public to keep\nthe inexperienced / curious from attempting to follow you.</p>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<p><a\nhref=\"https://stateparks.oregon.gov/index.cfm?do=park.profile&amp;parkId=121\">Shepperd's\nDell State Natural Area</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<p><a\nhref=\"https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=hJmV8iiBi1w&amp;fbclid=IwAR15eNQi1lQBr5dBC_YFtkTNd5uMUes3-L-6RasQU449qPxvNa1coXwwgUY\">https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=hJmV8iiBi1w&amp;fbclid=IwAR15eNQi1lQBr5dBC_YFtkTNd5uMUes3-L-6RasQU449qPxvNa1coXwwgUY</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n<p>Creek was first descended by Portland locals in October 2015.</p>\n",
