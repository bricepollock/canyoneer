  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>There is an X downclimb into a large pool about 1/2 way down. This is\nthe crux move. It can be done with a sandtrap or it can be avoided by\nscrambling up a RDC and walking the rim down a couple hundred feet. The\nentry into the main drainage is an 30 foot R downclimb that is a bit\ntricky to get into but very straightforward once your in. In addition\nthere are a few nice high stemming sections and several silo\ncrossings.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n"
