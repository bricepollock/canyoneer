The Wyeth Trail has just reopened as of Oct 20, 2022.\n<\/p><p>Be aware: Harphan Creek was overrun by the Eagle Creek wildfire in September 2017. Please use extreme caution when descending the creek. Between landslides, fallen trees, and loose rocks, this area may be unstable and dangerous for years go come. The canyon may have changed dramatically. Do not rely on the beta below being accurate until we start getting some trip reports back.\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>From the Wyeth Campground, follow the obvious trail south to a four-way jct and turn left on the Wyeth Trail.  The trail initially swings back north, passes around the nose of the Harphan Ridge, and eventually plunges into the forest.  After 0.5mi the trail crosses Harphan Creek.  This is the checkpoint.  Continue on up the trail for another 2.5mi, through numerous switchbacks.  Around 1800’ the trail finishes switchbacking and swings south.  Continue to about 1900’ elevation (UTM 10 596512mE 5058852mN) and look for a good place to drop down into the creek.  We found a steep forested ridgeline to descend that was surprisingly clear of underbrush.  Enter the creek at about 1500' elevation.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<ul><li>R1: 30ft off large log spanning the creek.<\/li><\/ul>\n<p>About 100yrds below R1 is a short 4ft downclimb.  Below is <b>Harphan Creek Falls<\/b> (R2 &amp; R3) - a beautiful twisting five-tier falls about 165ft in height.  You cannot see the bottom from the top.\n<\/p>\n<ul><li>R2: Descend two 10ft tiers or downclimb left.<\/li>\n<li>R3: ~140ft from mossy boulder mid-creek.  Falls drops to a small platform, then twists and goes off a big drop to a low-angle ramp at the bottom.  Can be a difficult rope pull.<\/li><\/ul>\n<p>Continue downcanyon, passing an enormous house-sized boulder on the left.\n<\/p>\n<ul><li>R4: 40ft in two tiers. Large fallen cedar.<\/li><\/ul>\n<p>About five minutes below is the next drop, possibly 15ft high, but choked with fallen logs an debris.  Downclimb DCL.  Second tier below (20ft) also choked with a logjam.  Walk off DCL or stay in the drainage.\n<\/p><p>Continue downstream another 30-40min to the Wyeth Trail.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Follow the
