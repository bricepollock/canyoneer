  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>Lots of loose rock - kinda like a high-angle alluvial fan, in parts.\nNot recommended.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>Park near Badwater as for Helios. Most of approach is shared with\nHelios. Wander up the alluvial fan to a distinct but shallow buttress.\nClimb the face of the buttress until above the first cliff band, then\nstep left to get into the rock gully to the left. Follow this up up up\nuntil the angle eases somewhat.</p>\n<p>Smart people at this point will go to the right and descend\nHelios.</p>\n<p>Less-smart people will go left past two or three gullies to a point\nabove a round peak now below you. If crossing the gullies is too\ndifficult, go higher to where it is easier. Descend a ridge to the\nsaddle behind the round peak, then cut right into the canyon north of\nthe round peak. Follow down to the first rappel or downclimb.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>Descend the canyon using natural anchors. Multiple stages from the\nsame anchor should help speed things up. Some rappels are exceptionally\nloose and dangerous, and anchors are not necessarily available at the\ntop of all rappels. Rappel, downclimb and handline until close to Hades\ncanyon. Step right and follow a ridge down to Hades canyon.</p>\n<p>Anchors are all natural off rockpiles etc. Bring webbing and\nrings.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>Walk out of Hades and head left to reach your car at the bottom of\nthe alluvial fan.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><img src=\"rwl_en.png\" title=\"rwl_en.png\" alt=\"rwl_en.png\" /><a\nhref=\"http://canyoncollective.com/betabase/rock-canyon.41\">CanyonCollective.com</a>\n: ROCK!
