Not recommended.\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Park near Badwater as for Helios. Most of approach is shared with Helios. Wander up the alluvial fan to a distinct but shallow buttress. Climb the face of the buttress until above the first cliff band, then step left to get into the rock gully to the left. Follow this up up up until the angle eases somewhat.\n<\/p><p>Smart people at this point will go to the right and descend Helios.\n<\/p><p>Less-smart people will go left past two or three gullies to a point above a round peak now below you. If crossing the gullies is too difficult, go higher to where it is easier. Descend a ridge to the saddle behind the round peak, then cut right into the canyon north of the round peak. Follow down to the first rappel or downclimb.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Descend the canyon using natural anchors. Multiple stages from the same anchor should help speed things up. Some rappels are exceptionally loose and dangerous, and anchors are not necessarily available at the top of all rappels. Rappel, downclimb and handline until close to Hades canyon. Step right and follow a ridge down to Hades canyon.\n<\/p><p>Anchors are all natural off rockpiles etc. Bring webbing and rings.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Walk out of Hades and head left to reach your car at the bottom of the alluvial fan.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Red_tape\">Red tape<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Beta_sites\">Beta sites<\/h2><\/div>\n<ul><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http:\/\/canyoncollective.com\/betabase\/rock-canyon.41\">CanyonCollective.com<\/a> &#160;: ROCK!
