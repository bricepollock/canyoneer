mw-parser-output\" lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><p>Deadhorse Creek is located within Mount Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest in Whatcom County, Washington. It is a tributary of Wells Creek and the North Fork Nooksack River. Deadhorse Creek forms the drainage basin between Cougar Divide and Skyline Divide. It is sourced primarily from semi-permanent ice (Hadley Glacier) and snowmelt. Deadhorse Creek is remarkable in that it includes a tall, narrow crack in addition to canyon development typical of the region. The technical challenges of this stream include its committing nature, high flow, and big, narrow pitches.\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading3\"><h3 id=\"Road_Closure\">Road Closure<\/h3><\/div>\n<p>A washout in November 2021 closed Deadhorse Road (Forest Service Road 37) to motorized wheeled vehicles at mile 3.1 (east of Mount Baker Highway WA-542). Non-motorized use is allowed beyond the closure. Attempting to descend Deadhorse Creek during the road closure would add 12.5 miles distance plus 2,250ft elevation gain of road walking\/cycling to the trip.\n<\/p>\n<ul><li>Current status of the road can be found on the  <b><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https:\/\/usfs.maps.arcgis.com\/apps\/MapSeries\/index.html?appid=2f5351d70b0d4ed9b13d372e9d109fcb\">Mt.

This has been added to the route map. In summary:\n<\/p>\n<ul><li><b>Approach<\/b>: Leave a vehicle at the closed <i>Excelsior Campground<\/i> (48.90863, -121.82132), staying well clear of the hydro-plant at the end of the road. Drive up nearby NF-33, and just before the summit turn right onto NF-30 for the last minute. From the end of the road start your hike NWN down towards the classic drop-in point, picking your line through breaks in cliff bands.<\/li>\n<li><b>Exit<\/b>: Hike down NF-37 until roughly SE of the closed Excelsior campground. Drop off the road towards the river, again picking a line through the cliff bands. Cross the river and climb the bank of the other side (again staying well clear of the hydro plant) to regain the road and the vehicles.<\/li><\/ul>\n<p>Some notes about this approach:\n<\/p>\n<ul><li>This requires crossing the NF Nooksack River (<a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https:\/\/waterdata.usgs.gov\/monitoring-location\/12205000\/#parameterCode=00060&amp;period=P7D&amp;showMedian=false\">flow gauge<\/a>), which was first done at 450cfs. Check this before departing! Thankfully there are plenty of places to see the river from the main Baker Highway.<\/li>\n<li>The shuttle setup is long, taking about 40mins to drive each way.<\/li>\n<li>NF-33 is rough in places. While likely possible in a medium-clearance 2wd, a high-clearance 4wd is much better suited to the terrain.<\/li><\/ul>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading3\"><h3 id=\"Special_note_for_season_openers_and_anchor_maintainers\">Special note for season openers and anchor maintainers<\/h3><\/div>\n<p>It is recommended that the first group of the season be prepared to install sustainable anchors (unlinked 316 stainless steel bolt anchors or v-threads) in the event that the existing bolt anchors are damaged. Safe natural anchor options are extremely limited at the bolted pitch heads. Also be prepared to replace webbing and quick links on the natural anchors.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Waterflow\">Waterflow<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Despite the roar and ominous appearance at the top of the three big pitches, the flow is dispersed such that the descending canyoner does not necessarily experience the full force of the water. Beginners will likely be intimidated and have difficulty. Advanced canyoners experienced with swift water may be able to safely negotiate more flow than in the “Very High” reference photo. Once in the deep chasm of this canyon, the wind and spray can make it very cold, so it is advisable to avoid unnecessary immersion until after you have progressed below the final big pitch. As of 2021, there were no unavoidable hydraulics.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading3\"><h3 id=\"Checkpoint_(bridge)\"><span id=\"Checkpoint_.28bridge.29\"><\/span>Checkpoint (bridge)<\/h3><\/div>\n<p>The checkpoint photo just upstream of the bridge is not indicative of the actual flow in the canyon because several hundred feet upstream of the bridge checkpoint, Deadhorse Creek <a class=\"external text\" href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/River_bifurcation\">bifurcates<\/a>, with part of the flow going north to the North Fork Nooksack River, and part going east into Wells Creek. This is not indicated on most maps but is shown on the Ropewiki map. Anticipate the flow in the canyon to be approximately 3-4 times that of the flow at the bridge checkpoint, since the majority of the flow is diverted away from the bridge.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading3\"><h3 id=\"Checkpoint_(waterfall)\"><span id=\"Checkpoint_.28waterfall.29\"><\/span>Checkpoint (waterfall)<\/h3><\/div>\n<p>Once at the drop-in, use the waterfall checkpoint photo to accurately assess the flow in the canyon. \n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading3\"><h3 id=\"Drainage_basin\">Drainage basin<\/h3><\/div>\n<p>The upper elevations of the drainage basin, below Chowder Ridge, include semi-permanent ice and snow of the western reaches of Hadley Glacier.

The pitch ends in a waist-deep pool about <code>30 ft \/ 10 m<\/code> long with howling, mist-filled wind. The rope pull is a concern, as the force of the water can push the rope end onto a ledge about <code>30 ft \/ 10 m<\/code> above the pool. It is recommended to pull from a stance as far out as possible, near the R6 bolt station, and give a firm pull at the moment the rope end slides through the anchor.\n<\/p><p>|- style=\"vertical-align:top; border-bottom: hidden;\"\n| style=\"border-right: hidden\" | <b>R6<\/b>\n| style=\"border-right: hidden\" | <code>150 ft \/ 46 m<\/code>\n| DCR - 2 bolt station\n|- style=\"vertical-align: top;\"\n| colspan=\"3\" | <i><b>Crack of Doom<\/b><\/i> <b>Pitch 2<\/b>\n<\/p>\n<ul><li>Option 1: It is possible to stay out of the forceful water much of the way by walking down a fin on DCR.

The flow was slightly higher than in the “Very High” reference photo, yet the 3 big rappels all had relatively forgiving lines. We all agreed this was more like “High” flow. The first descent team probably spent considerable time equipping the canyon and were more fearful of the unknown. As it is now, we encountered 3 bolt stations, all in good condition, did 2 retrievable anchors and replaced 4 pieces of webbing. We brought a drill but did not see any reason it would be needed. Standard creeping and rope management skills seemed to make rope pulls and core shot a non-issue, or we just got lucky. What a stunning gorge! With walls hundreds of feet high and very close together. The three big rappels had our FULL ATTENTION. Kudos to the first descent to crew.<\/dd><\/dl>\n<ul><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/media\/media_set?set=a.3044608988998917\">5 Sep 2020 (Facebook album)<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/iYQP_53j6HU\">27 Aug 2021 (YouTube video)<\/a><\/li><\/ul>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Background\">Background<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading3\"><h3 id=\"Geology\">Geology<\/h3><\/div>\n<p>The rocks in this section of Deadhorse Creek are of the Nooksack Formation.
