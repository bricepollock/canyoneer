  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>Probably the most impressive aspect of Kaiser Creek is how narrow of\nslots it cuts into the granite. This allows for some beautiful sections,\nand also even some fun stemming down climbs. Next is the weird rabbit\nholes and hidden passages that you can find beneath boulders and behind\nlarge slabs of rock that have fallen off into the canyon. These also\nform lots of sieves! Along with that there are lots of great waterfalls,\nrappels, and jumps like you would expect in a canyon in the Sierras.</p>\n<p>Overall it makes for an awesome adventure when flows are low and\nreasonable (guessing 2-3 cfs?), and probably a death trap if it got much\nhigher. There are lots of escape points, and the walls only remain high\nfor sections, but if you can't imagine holding yourself up with all of\nthe water in the canyon dumping on your head, think twice.</p>\n<p>The best checkpoint for waterflow is at the pool where you start the\ndescent, as shown on the map. You may still descend the canyon at high\nflow, just be prepared to bypass a lot of the falls.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>After driving past Shaver Lake, turn left on Huntington Lake Rd down\nto the community of Big Creek. Past Big Creek, you'll hit another\nintersection with Stump Springs Rd on the left (not sure if there is a\nsign). Take the left and drive around 15 miles, looking for a dirt road\nthrough a burn area less than half a mile before Westfall Creek (which\nis signed). Drive down this road around a mile to a 180 degree turn on\ntop of a ridge. Park here. You can also drop another car off another\nmile down the road at it's end if you want to save effort on the hike\nback up. It would be good to save a GPS point for the return trip.</p>\n<p>From about this point hike west down to a gully, and then straight\ndown to the creek.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>Shortly down canyon you'll come up on the first rappel. It's short,\nand drops down under a chockstone into a sort of cave, then opens up\ninto a shallow gorge.</p>\n<p>After the gorge closes in, a fun jump over another sort of cave\nfollows.</p>\n<p>Further down the canyon gets choked in with boulders and slabs that\nhave fallen in which make for exciting climbing and a pretty awesome\nsection, but with little in the way of rappels. Eventually one sliding\ndrop demands a rappel, and not long after the canyon opens up and at\nleast momentarily changes character.</p>\n<p>Large drops into some deep potholes follow. The first two of which\nmake for great jumps. But this puts you into a spot with pretty much no\nanchor options. While we made jokes about some jumping options below\nhere, it would be sketchy at best. Some bolts would probably add some\nfun to the route here, as the current route is to rappel off a tree past\nthe jumps down from the left. Rappel shortly down to some other trees on\na small ledge, then all the way down to a big pool which I want to say\nis around 180 feet total.</p>\n<p>From here down another decent sized rappel with some potential rope\npull issues exist. The next drop does not need to be rappelled. Look for\nthe other route, you'll like it.</p>\n<p>More rabbit holes, at least one short rappel follow until you get\ndown to a very pretty right hand turn and the canyon opens up. A\nshortcut from here is up on the right along a slab. Downstream is\nanother fun spot to jump, though you may want to scope out the landing.\nAs it starts to slot back up, be careful. Things are about to get a\nlittle odd.</p>\n<p>A short drop into a slot can be jumped, but it might require a\ndifferent maneuver to set the next rappel, which is back upstream from\nthe jump around a natural arch. This rappel drops down into a swirling\npothole backed up by a giant boulder. The water all disappears into a\nseive somewhere below your feet. Best to watch your step as you take off\nrappel, and stay close to the downcanyon left wall to get to the left\nside of the boulder where you can climb out. In higher flow the sieve\nmay be more dangerous so the other option is to rappel half way down the\nwaterfall and pull yourself into and over the crack on the right. Send\nyour best rock climber first and set up a meat guided rappel for those\nwho aren't as nimble. From there down is relatively simple through a\nbeautiful section of canyon to where it opens up.</p>\n<p>One last gorge to go, and it's an awesome one. We were running short\non time, and spotted a sieve that looked nastier than the previous one\nupstream, so decided to rappel in from some trees on the left below it.\nThis worked out nicely, and gave us good views of the small section we\nmissed. Going down the watercourse above would probably be awesome too,\nbut could call for more bolts.</p>\n<p>Below this rappel is a narrow section where it is not too difficult\nto stem over a waterfall which you almost certainly want to stay out of.\nIf this made someone uncomfortable, an anchor could be set off of a kind\nof natural arch up on the right.</p>\n<p>Nice hike from here out of the canyon. The lake is just\ndownstream.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>Move to the ridge on your left, and start hiking up! This is about\nsome of the best cross country sierras hiking you could hope for.\nOccasional minor brush, and some sand, but that's about it! You'll want\nto head up the ridge, angling slightly right to hit the dirt road.\nShouldn't have to walk into anything unpleasant. That's really all I can\nsay. A GPS would be a good idea, don't pass the road on the right side\nof it. That would suck.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<p>Canyon is inside burn area of 2020 Creek Fire. Expect impacts to\nroad, canyon, and surrounding area. Before going, review any relevant <a\nhref=\"https://www.fs.usda.gov/alerts/sierra/alerts-notices\">Sierra NF\nalerts and closure orders</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<p>July 17, 2019 {{#ev:youtube|jrTvVX5bYVw}}</p>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n",
