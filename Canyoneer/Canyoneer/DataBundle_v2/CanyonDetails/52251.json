The falls and gorge are visible from Highway 20 which sits across Gorge Lake. It features 7-8 rappels in rapid succession and with the right flow, it provides a perfect cool down for the Summer months in the PNW. The pronunciation of Bouck Creek has been a fun source of conversation while climbing the chossy and crappy boulder fields. Is it Boo-ck, Bow-k (take a bow), Bow-k (tie a bow), Bow-eque? We've landed on Bow-k (take a bow) but your variation is as good as ours.\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Park just west of the second tunnel (easterly bound) on Highway 20.\n<\/p><p>A water shuttle is required.  This canyon was scouted by using packrafts, scrambling down a debris field just east of the second (easterly) tunnel on Highway 20.  Note: there is also a boat ramp about 2.5 east of the canyon near Diablo.  \n<\/p><p>Once on the proper side of the lake, scramble the boulder field on the Westerly aspect (DCL)  It steepens.

While the canyon is within National Recreation Area (non-wilderness) bounds, the Gorge Lake area remains a highly sensitive area when it comes to recreation. This is in part due to abundant falcon activity in the area. The park service has worked closely with the climbing community to find a balance between recreation (specifically at the Newhalem Crags area) and conservation. As of 2019, the Gorge Lake cragging areas (one of which was accessed via boat) were closed indefinitely by the park service until a formal NEPA process (environmental impact study) could be completed. While there are no specific rules about canyoning, the Newhalem area, and particularly the Gorge Lake area, are highly sensitive areas for the park service. Accessing Bouck Creek is not recommended at this time.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Beta_sites\">Beta sites<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Scouting Trip - May 31, 2018. <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external free\" href=\"https:\/\/m.facebook.com\/story.php?story_fbid=10107948364261208&amp;id=10710383\">https:\/\/m.facebook.com\/story.php?story_fbid=10107948364261208&amp;id=10710383<\/a>\nFirst Decent - July 28, 2018. <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external free\" href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/harukajames.lipscomb\/media_set?set=a.1606128269513670&amp;type=3&amp;comment_id=1606981299428367&amp;notif_id=1532996257015528&amp;notif_t=photo_album_comment\">https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/harukajames.lipscomb\/media_set?set=a.1606128269513670&amp;type=3&amp;comment_id=1606981299428367&amp;notif_id=1532996257015528&amp;notif_t=photo_album_comment<\/a>\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Background\">Background<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>The canyon was first descended on July 28, 2018 by Erik Bernhoft, Haruka-James Lipscomb, Jake Huddleston, and Tiffanie Lin.
