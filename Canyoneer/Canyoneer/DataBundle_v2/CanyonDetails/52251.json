  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>Bouck Creek Drains from Bouck Lake, high above. The falls and gorge\nare visible from Highway 20 which sits across Gorge Lake. It features\n7-8 rappels in rapid succession and with the right flow, it provides a\nperfect cool down for the Summer months in the PNW. The pronunciation of\nBouck Creek has been a fun source of conversation while climbing the\nchossy and crappy boulder fields. Is it Boo-ck, Bow-k (take a bow),\nBow-k (tie a bow), Bow-eque? We've landed on Bow-k (take a bow) but your\nvariation is as good as ours.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>Park just west of the second tunnel (easterly bound) on Highway\n20.</p>\n<p>A water shuttle is required. This canyon was scouted by using\npackrafts, scrambling down a debris field just east of the second\n(easterly) tunnel on Highway 20. Note: there is also a boat ramp about\n2.5 east of the canyon near Diablo.</p>\n<p>Once on the proper side of the lake, scramble the boulder field on\nthe Westerly aspect (DCL) It steepens. Ultimately stay in the boulder\nfields (gradually bending right) as you ascend. There is a walk-in\nentrance near the GPS pin above.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>At around 1700', look for a low-angle ramp and walk down into the\ncanyon. There are probably 2-3 rappels above this point but they have\nnot been descended as of July 28, 2018.</p>\n<p>R1: 20' DCL. Webbing wrapped around boulder</p>\n<p>R2: 60' DCR</p>\n<p>R3: 20' DCL. Deadman</p>\n<p>R4: 50' DCL</p>\n<p>R5: 50' DCR</p>\n<p>R6: 100' DCL. 2 stage rappel. The 2nd half of the rappel is down a\nchute.</p>\n<p>R7: 15' DCL. Webbing wrapped around a rock.</p>\n<p>R8: 70' DCL. There is a small pothole prior to getting to the bolts.\nIn moderate to low flow, it is possible to slide into the pothole\nwithout risk of getting swept over. However, it is recommended to setup\na handline/line as a safety precaution.</p>\n<p>A small waterfall exists after R8 but it was bypassed DCL due to all\nthe debris and logs.</p>\n<p>R9: 40' DCR. Webbing around a rock pinch.</p>\n<p>R10: 50'. Webbing around a log.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>Return across the lake, deflate water crafts, and hike back up the\nboulder field.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<p>This is in the North Cascades National Park Service Complex. While\nthe canyon is within National Recreation Area (non-wilderness) bounds,\nthe Gorge Lake area remains a highly sensitive area when it comes to\nrecreation. This is in part due to abundant falcon activity in the area.\nThe park service has worked closely with the climbing community to find\na balance between recreation (specifically at the Newhalem Crags area)\nand conservation. As of 2019, the Gorge Lake cragging areas (one of\nwhich was accessed via boat) were closed indefinitely by the park\nservice until a formal NEPA process (environmental impact study) could\nbe completed. While there are no specific rules about canyoning, the\nNewhalem area, and particularly the Gorge Lake area, are highly\nsensitive areas for the park service. Accessing Bouck Creek is not\nrecommended at this time.</p>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<p>Scouting Trip - May 31, 2018. <a\nhref=\"https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=10107948364261208&amp;id=10710383\">https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=10107948364261208&amp;id=10710383</a>\nFirst Decent - July 28, 2018. <a\nhref=\"https://www.facebook.com/harukajames.lipscomb/media_set?set=a.1606128269513670&amp;type=3&amp;comment_id=1606981299428367&amp;notif_id=1532996257015528&amp;notif_t=photo_album_comment\">https://www.facebook.com/harukajames.lipscomb/media_set?set=a.1606128269513670&amp;type=3&amp;comment_id=1606981299428367&amp;notif_id=1532996257015528&amp;notif_t=photo_album_comment</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n<p>The canyon was first descended on July 28, 2018 by Erik Bernhoft,\nHaruka-James Lipscomb, Jake Huddleston, and Tiffanie Lin. Bouck was\ninitially scouted on May 31, 2018 by Erik and Tiffanie. When we first\nsaw the steep cliff sides, we initially thought it was impossible to\nfind a safe way to approach the top. We decided to packraft across the\nlake anyway and have a further look.</p>\n",
