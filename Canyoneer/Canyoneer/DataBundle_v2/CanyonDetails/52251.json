The falls and gorge are visible from Highway 20 which sits across Gorge Lake. It features 7-8 rappels in rapid succession and with the right flow, it provides a perfect cool down for the Summer months in the PNW. The pronunciation of Bouck Creek has been a fun source of conversation while climbing the chossy and crappy boulder fields. Is it Boo-ck, Bow-k (take a bow), Bow-k (tie a bow), Bow-eque? We've landed on Bow-k (take a bow) but your variation is as good as ours.\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Park just west of the second tunnel (easterly bound) on Highway 20.\n<\/p><p>A water shuttle is required.  This canyon was scouted by using packrafts, scrambling down a debris field just east of the second (easterly) tunnel on Highway 20.  Note: there is also a boat ramp about 2.5 east of the canyon near Diablo.  \n<\/p><p>Once on the proper side of the lake, scramble the boulder field on the Westerly aspect (DCL)  It steepens.  Ultimately stay in the boulder fields (gradually bending right) as you ascend.  There is a walk-in entrance near the GPS pin above.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>At around 1700', look for a low-angle ramp and walk down into the canyon. There are probably 2-3 rappels above this point but they have not been descended as of July 28, 2018. \n<\/p><p>R1: 20' DCL. Webbing wrapped around boulder\n<\/p><p>R2: 60' DCR\n<\/p><p>R3: 20' DCL.

Webbing wrapped around a rock.\n<\/p><p>R8: 70' DCL. There is a small pothole prior to getting to the bolts. In moderate to low flow, it is possible to slide into the pothole without risk of getting swept over. However, it is recommended to setup a handline\/line as a safety precaution. \n<\/p><p>A small waterfall exists after R8 but it was bypassed DCL due to all the debris and logs.\n<\/p><p>R9: 40' DCR.

While the canyon is within National Recreation Area (non-wilderness) bounds, the Gorge Lake area remains a highly sensitive area when it comes to recreation. This is in part due to abundant falcon activity in the area. The park service has worked closely with the climbing community to find a balance between recreation (specifically at the Newhalem Crags area) and conservation. As of 2019, the Gorge Lake cragging areas (one of which was accessed via boat) were closed indefinitely by the park service until a formal NEPA process (environmental impact study) could be completed. While there are no specific rules about canyoning, the Newhalem area, and particularly the Gorge Lake area, are highly sensitive areas for the park service. Accessing Bouck Creek is not recommended at this time.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Beta_sites\">Beta sites<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Scouting Trip - May 31, 2018. <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external free\" href=\"https:\/\/m.facebook.com\/story.php?story_fbid=10107948364261208&amp;id=10710383\">https:\/\/m.facebook.com\/story.php?story_fbid=10107948364261208&amp;id=10710383<\/a>\nFirst Decent - July 28, 2018. <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external free\" href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/harukajames.lipscomb\/media_set?set=a.1606128269513670&amp;type=3&amp;comment_id=1606981299428367&amp;notif_id=1532996257015528&amp;notif_t=photo_album_comment\">https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/harukajames.lipscomb\/media_set?set=a.1606128269513670&amp;type=3&amp;comment_id=1606981299428367&amp;notif_id=1532996257015528&amp;notif_t=photo_album_comment<\/a>\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Background\">Background<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>The canyon was first descended on July 28, 2018 by Erik Bernhoft, Haruka-James Lipscomb, Jake Huddleston, and Tiffanie Lin. Bouck was initially scouted on May 31, 2018 by Erik and Tiffanie. When we first saw the steep cliff sides, we initially thought it was impossible to find a safe way to approach the top. We decided to packraft across the lake anyway and have a further look.\n<\/p>\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nParsed by mw‐api‐ext.codfw.main‐6779cc57fc‐hfwrl\nCached time: 20240914192017\nCache expiry: 2592000\nReduced expiry: false\nComplications: [show‐toc]\nCPU time usage: 0.005 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.006 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 21\/1000000\nPost‐expand include size: 0\/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 0\/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 2\/100\nExpensive parser function count: 0\/500\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0\/20\nUnstrip post‐expand size: 0\/5000000 bytes\nNumber of Wikibase entities loaded: 0\/400\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%    0.000      1 -total\n-->\n<\/div>","geojson":{"features":[{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"coordinates":[[-121.19959,48.701424,0],[-121.199005,48.70157,0],[-121.19841,48.701607,0],[-121.19789,48.701607,0],[-121.197426,48.70157,0],[-121.196846,48.701492,0],[-121.19665,48.701454,0],[-121.197,48.701233,0],[-121.19706,48.70108,0],[-121.19684,48.7008,0],[-121.19672,48.700703,0],[-121.19661,48.7005,0],[-121.19807,48.69877,0],[-121.19809,48.698753,0],[-121.198105,48.698505,0],[-121.19773,48.698242,0],[-121.19773,48.697777,0],[-121.198,48.697495,0],[-121.198006,48.697205,0],[-121.197845,48.696968,0],[-121.19785,48.69648,0],[-121.19791,48.696274,0],[-121.19791,48.696,0],[-121.1979,48.69568,0],[-121.197845,48.695435,0],[-121.19773,48.695255,0],[-121.19757643207308,48.695148405791905,0]],"type":"LineString"},"properties":{"name":"Approach"}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"name":"Approach - Not Confirmed"},"geometry":{"coordinates":[[-121.1975764320731,48.695148405791905,0],[-121.19756000000001,48.695137,0],[-121.19727999999998,48.695187,0],[-121.19707499999998,48.695156,0],[-121.19672000000003,48.69495,0],[-121.19662499999998,48.694702,0],[-121.19665500000002,48.69457,0]],"type":"LineString"}},{"properties":{"name":"Descent"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"LineString","coordinates":[[-121.19756195140144,48.69512451754714,0],[-121.1975,48.695675,0],[-121.197525,48.696583,0],[-121.197205,48.697105,0],[-121.197334,48.69736,0],[-121.197464,48.697773,0],[-121.19749,48.698734,0]]}},{"properties":{"name":"Descent - Not Confirmed"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"coordinates":[[-121.19672400000002,48.694542,0],[-121.19756999999998,48.695053,0],[-121.19756195140144,48.69512451754714,0]],"type":"LineString"}},{"geometry":{"coordinates":[[-121.197975,48.69878,0],[-121.19665,48.700535,0],[-121.196655,48.700542,0],[-121.19674,48.70069,0],[-121.196846,48.700775,0],[-121.1971,48.70107,0],[-121.19702,48.70124,0],[-121.19666,48.701454,0],[-121.19739,48.701557,0],[-121.19789,48.70159,0],[-121.19841,48.701595,0],[-121.199,48.70156,0],[-121.199646,48.701397,0]],"type":"LineString"},"type":"Feature","properties":{"name":"Exit"}},{"properties":{"name":"Inflate packrafts"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[[-121.1966,48.7006,0]]}},{"geometry":{"coordinates":[[-121.1997,48.7014,0]],"type":"Point"},"properties":{"name":"Park"},"type":"Feature"}],"type":"FeatureCollection"},"shuttleSeconds":null,"latitude":48.6948,"id":52251,"version":"50231145ad9479cb9631e4ba9a776a11a1652685ea21874c4678bbfa8aad1a49"}
