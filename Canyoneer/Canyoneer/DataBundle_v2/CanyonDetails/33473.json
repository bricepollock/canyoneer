In the canyon we can find some nice rope descents and pure green pools, which are sometimes filled with gravel, depending on the conditions. Approach is not long but it is complicated and exposed at some places. We recommend this canyon to all those who are eager for a more adventurous approach to canyoning and those who love a wild environment. \n<\/p><p><b>Zone:<\/b>  Italy – Friuli – Val Dogna \n<\/p><p><b>Dimensions:<\/b> Entrance: 875 m Exit: 580 m Height: 305 m Length: 450 m   \n<\/p><p><b>Period<\/b>  March-October \n<\/p><p><b>Times:<\/b>  Approach: 45 min.

In the village, follow the signs for Val Dogna valley, cross the bridge over the Fella river, drive under the motorway bridge and after approximately 100 meters you will find a large parking lot on the right side. Here is the parking for the first car or if you have just one car. With the second car drive back in the direction to Dogna village and before the bridge over the Fella river turn right and at the first road turning right again (sign for Chiut Pupin). Follow this steep road to the Chiut Pupin (few houses), where the road ends. Park your car on the left or right side (very small parking lot) and be considerate to the residents.\n<\/p><p>Take the marked path CAI 602 and follow it uphill past two old ruins and over a metal bridge. After the bridge you will soon reach a bad hunters path on the right. Take it and follow it to the last small concrete water coverage, pass it and continue to the small creek bed (sometimes it is dry). Cross it (here is the path very badly visible) and continue in the direction of the small rocky channel. Scramble up this rocky channel and leave it after a few meters and climb to the edge on the right. From the top of this edge, follow the animals track horizontally to the right (cut branches) until we reach a steep grassy channel. From here climb 5 meters uphill, cross it on the small grassy ledge (3 meters exposed) to reach easy terrain. From here go slightly downhill (help us with cut branches) and soon we reach the wood where the slope levels out a bit and the path is more visible. The path crosses the forest and climbs slightly to the top of a wooden ridge. From here, we go downhill along the rocky barrier to the creek bed.
