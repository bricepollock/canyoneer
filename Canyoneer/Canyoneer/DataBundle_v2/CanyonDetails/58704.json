Look closely and you’ll find ancient cliff dwellings and marvel at how those who came before us made their homes in places seemingly impossible to get to today. The views on this descent are among the best in any Sedona canyon.  \n<\/p><p>Grizzly Canyon can be done with or without a car shuttle.  If using a shuttle, leave the exit vehicle at Fay Canyon Trailhead.  Without a shuttle, plan to walk 0.8 miles up Boynton Pass Road back to the Bear Mountain Trailhead.\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Start at the Bear Mountain Trailhead and hike 2.3 miles and 1,800 feet of elevation gain along a well-maintained trail to the summit of Bear Mountain.  Stop to catch your breath and enjoy the views along the way, which only get better as you get higher.  When you see the “end trail” sign, your adventure is just beginning.  Travel northeast along the ridge for another 0.8 miles to the head of the canyon, picking the best path through thick patches of manzanita, juniper, agave and scrub oak.  After about 0.5 miles, you will emerge from the worst of the brush and enjoy breathtaking panoramic views with steep drop-offs on both sides of your path.  It is an incredible place.  Take a break here and soak it all in.\n<\/p><p>Make your way to the drop-in point by continuing along the ridge.  Stay hiker's right of the ridge once the elevation begins to drop.  Downclimb sloped sandstone ledges, aiming for a lone pine tree on a small ledge which is the anchor for the first rappel.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p><b>R1:<\/b> 150' off of large pine tree on small ledge.  Be careful with foot placement as some of the rock slabs\/edges are brittle and could cause rockfall for those below (easy to avoid with care).\n<\/p><p>Downclimb ~200' of steep sandstone slabs, switchbacking to find the easiest way down.  May be heady for some as there are a couple spots with exposure.  Option to set rappel from large tree at bottom of R1 if needed.  Don't forget to look back up at the view from the bottom - very cool topography here.\n<\/p><p><b>R2:<\/b> 75' off of tree.  Steep overhang at top, then mostly free hanging in a pretty grotto.\n<\/p><p><b>R3:<\/b> 180' off of boulder to large ledge.  Three stages - will pass two ledges while on rappel.\n<\/p><p><b>R4:<\/b> 70' off of tree LDC to ledge then downclimb last ledge LDC, stemming off tree. \n<\/p><p><b>R5:<\/b> 40' off of tree.  Best to downclimb first ledge then get on rappel.  Rappeller is on wall all the way down.\n<\/p><p><b>R6:<\/b> 125' off of tree LDC ~30' back from the lip.  The coolest rappel of the canyon with unbelievable views in all directions.  Mostly free hanging in a huge grotto, passing ancient ruins while on rappel.  Webbing is extended to assist with the pull.  Recommend an additional ~50' on the pull side to get a good angle for rope retrieval.  Be sure to drop rope just off of edge, do not throw it out. High potential to get stuck in trees if rope is thrown blindly.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Follow the drainage to the end of Fay Canyon Trail.  Continue on the well-maintained Fay Canyon Trail for 1.3 miles to the parking lot and your exit vehicle.  If you did not set an exit vehicle, continue walking 0.8 miles southwest up Boynton Pass Road to return to the Bear Mountain Trailhead.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Red_tape\">Red tape<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Red Rocks pass required for parking at trailhead. $5 per day at pay station at trailhead.

Webbing is extended to assist with the pull.  ~140' of rope travel to the bottom of the rappel.  Extra ~50' needed on the pull side to facilitate rope retrieval.\n<\/p><p>9\/26\/2020: The tree LDC nearest to edge should NOT be used for the last rappel. The slabs of rock on the down canyon side of it are unstable and at extremely high risk of sliding when any weight is put on the anchor. We had a 150lb slab nearly fall on us from that was dislodged from this anchor. The instability of these slabs also leaves the root system of the tree somewhat suspect.\n<\/p><p><br \/>\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Background\">Background<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>First Descent: William Lan, John Hewitt, Jim Clarkin, &amp; Brian Deavila\n2016. \n<\/p><p>Jacob Cowan, Brandon Levander, and Erek Burek did canyon in March 2020 before it was published or beta was known, under assumption it would be a first descent.
