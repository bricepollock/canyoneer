  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>Sitting high above central Sedona, Grizzly Canyon offers sweeping\npanoramas of the area’s famous red sandstone mesas, striped desert\ntowers and jagged rock fins. Look closely and you’ll find ancient cliff\ndwellings and marvel at how those who came before us made their homes in\nplaces seemingly impossible to get to today. Haribo offers rare views\nonly otherwise enjoyed by intrepid off-trail hikers and those with a\nhelicopter. There are spectacular, overhung rappels into beautiful\nred-orange grottos and a long, memorable and semi-spicy downclimb on\ntiered sandstone slabs. The views on this descent are among the best in\nany Sedona canyon.</p>\n<p>This canyon can be done with or without a car shuttle. If using a\nshuttle, leave the exit vehicle at Fay Canyon Trailhead. Without a\nshuttle, plan to walk 0.8 miles up Boynton Pass Road back to the Bear\nMountain Trailhead.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>Start at the Bear Mountain Trailhead and hike 2.3 miles and 1,800\nfeet of elevation gain along a well-maintained trail to the summit of\nBear Mountain. Stop to catch your breath and enjoy the views along the\nway, which only get better as you get higher. When you see the “end\ntrail” sign, your adventure is just beginning. Travel northeast along\nthe ridge for another 0.8 miles to the head of the canyon, picking the\nbest path through thick patches of manzanita, juniper, agave and scrub\noak. After about 0.5 miles, you will emerge from the worst of the brush\nand enjoy breathtaking panoramic views with steep drop-offs on both\nsides of your path. It is an incredible place. Take a break here and\nsoak it all in.</p>\n<p>Make your way to the drop-in point by continuing along the ridge.\nStay hiker's right of the ridge once the elevation begins to drop.\nDownclimb sloped sandstone ledges, aiming for a lone pine tree on a\nsmall ledge which is the anchor for the first rappel.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p><strong>R1:</strong> 150' off of large pine tree on small ledge. Be\ncareful with foot placement as some of the rock slabs/edges are brittle\nand could cause rockfall for those below (easy to avoid with care).</p>\n<p>Downclimb ~200' of steep sandstone slabs, switchbacking to find the\neasiest way down. May be heady for some as there are a couple spots with\nexposure. Option to set rappel from large tree at bottom of R1 if\nneeded. Don't forget to look back up at the view from the bottom - very\ncool topography here.</p>\n<p><strong>R2:</strong> 75' off of tree. Steep overhang at top, then\nmostly free hanging in a pretty grotto.</p>\n<p><strong>R3:</strong> 180' off of boulder to large ledge. Three stages\n- will pass two ledges while on rappel.</p>\n<p><strong>R4:</strong> 70' off of tree LDC to ledge then downclimb last\nledge LDC, stemming off tree.</p>\n<p><strong>R5:</strong> 40' off of tree. Best to downclimb first ledge\nthen get on rappel. Rappeller is on wall all the way down.</p>\n<p><strong>R6:</strong> 125' off of tree LDC ~30' back from the lip. The\ncoolest rappel of the canyon with unbelievable views in all directions.\nMostly free hanging in a huge grotto, passing ancient ruins while on\nrappel. Webbing is extended to assist with the pull. Recommend an\nadditional ~50' on the pull side to get a good angle for rope retrieval.\nBe sure to drop rope just off of edge, do not throw it out. High\npotential to get stuck in trees if rope is thrown blindly.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>Follow the drainage to the end of Fay Canyon Trail. Continue on the\nwell-maintained Fay Canyon Trail for 1.3 miles to the parking lot and\nyour exit vehicle. If you did not set an exit vehicle, continue walking\n0.8 miles southwest up Boynton Pass Road to return to the Bear Mountain\nTrailhead.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<p>Red Rocks pass required for parking at trailhead. $5 per day at pay\nstation at trailhead. Annual National Park Pass will also work.</p>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><img src=\"rwl_en.png\" title=\"rwl_en.png\" alt=\"rwl_en.png\" /><a\nhref=\"https://wildpathsaz.com/grizzly-canyon/\">WildPathsAZ.com</a> :\nGrizzly Canyon</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><img src=\"rwl_en.png\" title=\"rwl_en.png\" alt=\"rwl_en.png\" /><a\nhref=\"https://sedonacanyoneering.com/grizzly-canyon/\">sedonacanyoneering.com</a>\n: Grizzly Canyon</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<p>{{#ev:youtube|v=2pf0s4agueE}}</p>\n<p>{{#ev:vimeo|645637037}}</p>\n<p><a\nhref=\"https://www.abc15.com/news/region-northern-az/sedona/hikers-trapped-on-cliff-in-sedona-rescued-after-several-days-in-extreme-weather\">ABC15\nNews</a> : 01/27/2021: Three Stranded Are Rescued After Several Days</p>\n<p>10/11/2020: The last rappel has been reset to anchor off of a solid\ntree LDC approx. 30 feet back from the lip. Webbing is extended to\nassist with the pull. ~140' of rope travel to the bottom of the rappel.\nExtra ~50' needed on the pull side to facilitate rope retrieval.</p>\n<p>9/26/2020: The tree LDC nearest to edge should NOT be used for the\nlast rappel. The slabs of rock on the down canyon side of it are\nunstable and at extremely high risk of sliding when any weight is put on\nthe anchor. We had a 150lb slab nearly fall on us from that was\ndislodged from this anchor. The instability of these slabs also leaves\nthe root system of the tree somewhat suspect.</p>\n<p>{{#ev:youtube|v=dnvdqLxHeZc}}</p>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n<p>First Known Descent by William Lan.</p>\n",
