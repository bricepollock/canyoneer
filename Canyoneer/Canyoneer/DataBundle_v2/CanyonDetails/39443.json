At the first fork in this road, signs point left to a 3,000 won parking area. Going right up a steep bend takes you to a small guesthouse (?) where the owner charges 4,000 won. From this carpark, take the trail towards Bokhodgon Falls. The path hugs the main stream the entire way. At the first trail junction a footpath goes left whilst a vehicle friendly trail goes over the stream to the right. Both trails rejoin later on but the left path is more direct. Further ahead the trail will cross right over the stream again. Pass the information boards for Bokhodong Falls. Trail climbs more steeply now, and eventually crosses left over the stream once more. Trail continues climbing upwards; when it levels out, take an unmarked footpath for 10m to the stream bed. Begin your descent here.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Descent is straight forward until the first waterfall. \nAbseil #1 drops about 5-6m. You can descend in the water-flow – rock is almost stepped. Debris sometimes collects in the first major shelf. Pool at the very bottom is just over 1m deep. No undercuts or re-circulations. Alternatively, abseil down the dry vertical face on the river right. Anchors can be rigged from boulders or a tree on river right (tree sets up nicely for both lines).\nThis abseil can be re-climbed on river right, out of the stream, easily \nAbseil #2 is 8m, in the flow. There was a long tree branch lodged in the falls on 9th September – evidently it had been there for a while. A small ledge can be down-climbed to on river right, but no jump or further climbing is possible from here, although it allows for good inspection of the drop. One precariously balanced boulder was immediately above the falls on river left on the 9th September. This fall cannot be re-ascended without a rope. \nDescent is non technical from here until wherever you choose to egress – refer to topo for interesting features. \n[Unsure whether the 6 8m falls are 쌍룡폭포, or the climbable drops after the next trail intersection]. \n<\/p>\n<style data-mw-deduplicate=\"TemplateStyles:r1062633282\">@media all and (max-width:720px){.mw-parser-output .content .thumb>div:not(.thumbinner){display:flex;justify-content:center;flex-wrap:wrap;align-content:flex-start;flex-direction:column}}body.skin-vector .mw-parser-output div.thumb>div:not(.thumbinner){font-size:94%;text-align:center;overflow:hidden;min-width:100px}body.skin-minerva .mw-parser-output div.thumb>div:not(.thumbinner){margin:0 auto;max-width:100%!important}<\/style> \n<div class=\"thumb tright\">\n<div style=\"display:table;\">\n<span class=\"mw-default-size\" typeof=\"mw:Error mw:File\/Frameless\">\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Use the approach trail to return back to the carpark.\nThere are some more drops on the stream – enter, descend and egress if you want.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Red_tape\">Red tape<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Beta_sites\">Beta sites<\/h2><\/div>\n<ul><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external free\" href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/koreancanyoning\/\">https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/koreancanyoning\/<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external free\" href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/maps\/d\/edit?hl=en&amp;authuser=0&amp;mid=1V-S2aDtsrLaYjmVQleNdVAvotKQ\">https:\/\/www.google.com\/maps\/d\/edit?hl=en&amp;authuser=0&amp;mid=1V-S2aDtsrLaYjmVQleNdVAvotKQ<\/a><\/li><\/ul>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Background\">Background<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>No known recorded descents of the stream above Bokhodong’s tributary.
