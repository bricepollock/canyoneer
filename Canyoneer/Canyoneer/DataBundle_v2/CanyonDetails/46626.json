Archer might be a good choice early in the season when other creeks are flowing too high. Creek was beginner-friendly when scouted in January 2017. Don't bother with this one after March.\n<\/p>\n<ul><li>Creek was fairly clear when first visited in 2017, but became a serious mess of woody debris after the snow-pocalypse event of 2019. Expect the bottom to be full of brush and bushwhacking.<\/li><\/ul>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading3\"><h3 id=\"Lower_Trailhead\">Lower Trailhead<\/h3><\/div>\n<p>From Hwy 6, follow Jordan Creek Rd for 1mi, crossing a bridge just before reaching a junction.  Continue straight on Jordan Creek Rd, ignoring all other turns for 2.3mi where Archer Creek flows beneath the road in a culvert.  Good spot to check the creek for flow.\n<\/p><p>If you are not going to do a shuttle, follow the ORV trail that leads up the ridge west of Archer Creek.  Walk west along Jordan Creek Rd for 0.3mi to find the obvious bottom of the trail and follow it upwards.  It a bit eroded and steep. Once you are on the ridge, stay on it the rest of the way. Hike up to about 1800' elevation and drop east into the creek.  Takes about 1hr.  Hiking up early in the morning may be best to avoid possibility of encountering ORVs.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading3\"><h3 id=\"Upper_Trailhead\">Upper Trailhead<\/h3><\/div>\n<p>From the lower parking area, backtrack west on Jordan Creek Rd to the aforementioned junction near the bridge and turn right.  Google Maps lies to you here and says the road doesn't go through, but it does. High clearance recommended per deep gravel. Use caution as the road is narrow, steep, and there are a number of blind corners on the road where meeting oncoming traffic could be bad. Keep following the road along the crest for about 3.5mi until you reach Archer Pond.\n<\/p><p>From the pullout on the west side of the creek, locate an obvious maintained trail climbing over a log.  Follow the trail downwards west of the creek (easy) and drop in about 1800ft elevation.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<ul><li>15ft downclimb (~1820').<\/li><\/ul>\n<p>Just ahead:  thicket of briars &amp; devils club.

Recommend anchoring DCR to descend all three tiers in one go.<\/li>\n<li>R7:  40ft.  Several trees have fallen across the falls forming an obstacle to rappel through.<\/li><\/ul>\n<p>Several 10-15ft downclimbs in quick succession.  Tributary enters from DCL.  Further downclimbs below.\n<\/p>\n<ul><li>R8:  25ft in three short tiers.<\/li>\n<li>R9:  20ft.<\/li>\n<li>Several downclimbs (10ft, 15ft).<\/li>\n<li>R10:  15ft.<\/li><\/ul>\n<p>More downclimbs follow. There are a couple 20ft drops near the bottom that can be rappelled, downclimbed, or bypassed depending on your enthusiasm.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Head downstream a few hundred feet and climb out wherever is easiest DCL.
