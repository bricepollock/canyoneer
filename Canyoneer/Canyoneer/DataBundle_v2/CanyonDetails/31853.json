  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>This is one of several, mostly unnamed, drainages on the rugged east\nflank of Jumbo Mountain, just south of Darrington off the Mountain Loop\nHighway. It is characterized by a steep gradient, clean bedrock, and\nmany consecutive drops. In the winter, snow often makes the road\nundrivable and the higher reaches of the canyon are filled with snow by\navalanches. The rappels are all close together, and rappel anchors (both\nnatural and bolted) are easy to find, and the approach is relatively\npainless and quick (for being off trail in the Cascades). Canyon walls\nsoar high above, decorated with the wet, vibrant greenery common to this\nregion.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>From Darrington, travel south on the Mountain Loop Highway for 2.9\nmiles. Take a right onto Frog Creek Road (FS Road 2060) and follow it\nfor 1.0 miles until you reach the bridge over the creek. There is room\nfor several cars to park in a pullout on the north side of the\nbridge.</p>\n<p>This part of the creek where it crosses the road can be deceivingly\ndry, as much of the creek is flowing underground. It does not represent\nthe true flow in the canyon upstream. If you can see any visible flow\nabove the bridge, it's likely that the creek is running in at least\nmoderate conditions.</p>\n<p>To reach the start of the canyon, walk the road approximately 100ft\nfurther south of the bridge and proceed uphill using the path of least\nresistance. You will be climber's left of the stream. Navigation is\nfairly simple, with the exception of a few easily avoidable cliff bands\nand the occasional blowdown. The terrain is fairly nice for being\noff-trail and the worst brush is in the first 100-200ft of vertical\ngain. Proceed uphill, generally following the fall line, but taking the\npath of least resistance. Go around a mossy slab at 2,550ft. Shortly\nthereafter, at 2,600ft, the ridge becomes steep, mossy cliffs. This is\nthe drop-in point.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p><strong>R1, 200ft</strong>: Rappel from the ridge off webbing around\na tree at the edge of the cliff. The rappel line will take you down a\nsmall, steep and brushy dirt gully. The gully opens into a brushy slope\nand finally deposits you in the creek. Gully has been pruned to reduce\nsnag hazards.</p>\n<p><strong>R2, 30ft</strong>: Single bolt DCL, across the creek from the\nend of R1. Two short drops into shallow pools.</p>\n<p><strong>R3, 100ft</strong>: Two bolt anchor on rock wall DCL, rap\n20ft into a pool, then continue over a longer drop into another\npool.</p>\n<p><strong>R4, 60ft</strong>: Single bolt anchor on downstream face of\nhumongous boulder. Walk/scramble 50ft to next anchor.</p>\n<p><strong>R5, 20ft</strong>: Rappel off boulder pinch, short but with\nan awkward transition over a chockstone.</p>\n<p>Walk 300ft in a beautiful, narrow canyon to next anchor.</p>\n<p>The top of R6 looks like a potential exit/entry point.</p>\n<p><strong>R6, 50ft</strong>: Two bolt anchor on downstream face of\nanother humongous boulder, rap DCL into a pool.</p>\n<p>Walk 50ft, then downclimb steeply 20ft DCR to bypass the main flow\n(this could be rigged as a short rap in future). The downclimb is steep\nand will be in the flow in moderate+ conditions. There are good positive\nhand &amp; foot placements, but some may want a handline.</p>\n<p><strong>R7, 200ft</strong>: Two bolt anchor DCR, rappel is over a\nseries of lower angle small waterfalls, ends DCL near small trees.</p>\n<p><strong>R8, 150ft</strong>: Two bolt anchor DCL set slightly back\nfrom the lip. Two-stage rappel in the waterflow.</p>\n<p><strong>R9, 70ft</strong>: Two bolt anchor DCR, largely free hanging\nrappel ending at a rock pile.</p>\n<p>Scramble/walk 200ft feet from the bottom of R8. The stream makes a\nhard left handed turn. Some parties, depending on conditions, may elect\nto do a short (10ft) rappel here. Otherwise continue on easy DCR ledges\nand slabs.</p>\n<p><strong>R10, 50ft</strong>: from tree anchor DCR, well out of the\nwatercourse (large, overhanging tree limbs). Rappel down a steep slab\ninto a pool below a constricted, narrow drop in the watercourse.</p>\n<p><strong>R11, 50ft</strong>: Immediately after R10, rappel off 2 bolt\nanchor DCL. The rappel is forced into the watercourse here, and it is a\nnarrow slot ending in a shallow pool. Named `The Pummeler`, this rappel\nis probably the canyon's limiting factor in high water conditions.</p>\n<p>Walk and scramble 200ft down to the next rappel.</p>\n<p><strong>R12, 100ft</strong>: Two bolt anchor on rock face DCR, option\nto rappel in the flow or just along DCR side of the flow.</p>\n<p>This is the last rappel, though there is another optional narrow\nwaterfall that you can rappel a bit downstream (easily avoided by simple\nscrambling).</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>From the pool of the last rappel, stay close to the canyon wall DCL\n(away from the watercourse), walking and scrambling down easy rock/slabs\nuntil that side steepens, cross over to the other side of the stream,\ndescend steep brush back to the stream and walk the now easy streambed\ndown to the car. Do not be tempted to take the old, overgrown road spur\nback. Note that the majority of the water in the stream vanishes\nmysteriously (underground, presumably) a few hundred feet before you\nreach the road and your vehicle.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<p>None.</p>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<p><a\nhref=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/pnwcanyoning/posts/10154217201090789/\">Video\ndocumenting the approach and each rappel</a> by Yana Radenska on May 29,\n2016. The beta above is slightly different from this trip as on a second\ntrip, we modified many of the anchors and consolidated or eliminated\nsome rappels.</p>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n",
