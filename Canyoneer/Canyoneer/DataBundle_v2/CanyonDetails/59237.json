The first descent party started at the Guadalupe trailhead and climbed Martinez Mountain before dropping into the canyon at 5741' elevation. The next year, they returned and dropped in at approximately 3900' elevation (33.57672, -116.31683), bypassing the first two rappels but saving a significant amount of elevation gain and loss on the approach.\n<\/p><p>It is also possible to ascend the ridge just north of (and parallel to) Guadalupe Creek, before crossing the Guadalupe Creek drainage itself at approximately 33.591600, -116.317668 and then following the ridge west of Martinez Canyon. While this route was originally plotted to access a separate feeder drainage of Martinez with a technical section of its own, it can be shortened to an ideal \"sneak\" route for parties wishing to access only the lower Martinez rappels with relative ease and expediency.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>(All rappel lengths are approximate.
