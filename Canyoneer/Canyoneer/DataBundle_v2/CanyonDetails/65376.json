  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>Clark Creek is a great early summer route that drains the east side\nof Three Peaks in the Olympic National Forest. Located in the upper\nreaches of the Wynoochee River valley, Clark features rapid fire\nrappels, multiple spots to test your downclimbing skills, and a variety\nof interesting geologic features from the wide open creekbed in the\nupper section to a more narrow gorge-like section in its lower reaches.\nOther interesting features include a swirling rooster tail rappel and a\nsiphon through a large pile of boulders that is possible to climb\nthrough for the brave ones among your group.</p>\n<p>Fast groups could easily combine this canyon with Bottleneck Canyon\nfurther down the valley for a full day of canyoning. Keep in mind that\nflows are known to become quite low in both canyons by mid to late\nsummer.</p>\n<p>This canyon requires rigging a traverse line to access an exposed\nanchor. Groups should be familiar with how to rig retrievable traverse\nlines. <strong>Please do not leave fixed traverse lines in\ncanyons!</strong> They are unnecessary and potentially unsafe as they\noften cannot be fully inspected for damage prior to use.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Checkpoint: The final falls in the canyon is easily seen from the\nroad for flow analysis.</li>\n<li>Watershed: 1.07mi^2. The highest point in the watershed is Three\nPeaks (~4600ft). The creek appears to be fed by several small\nlakes.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p><strong>Getting There</strong>: From Olympia, take Hwy 12 to the town\nof Montesano. This is the last stop for fuel and other supplies before\nheading north. From Montesano, take Wynoochee Valley Road north for 33\nmiles until it abruptly turns to gravel and becomes NF-2312. Continue\nanother 9.7 miles until the road reaches a junction. Turn left and cross\nthe Wynoochee River. Clark Creek is less than a minute up the road on\nthe left.</p>\n<p><strong>Parking</strong>: There are spots both above and below where\nthe road crosses Clark Creek to park multiple vehicles. The best spot is\njust downhill from the creek, though it is often taken by campers. In a\npinch, you can park at the T junction just before the road crosses the\nWynoochee River.</p>\n<p><strong>Approach</strong>: Not too far on the downhill/east side of\nthe creek, look for an open space to cut up into the forest. Look for a\nfaint use trail that meanders up the hillside. This use trail is marked\noccasionally with old flagging tape, but it is not consistent. At\nseveral points you may find yourself off the use trail, but the forest\nis not very thick/brushy in most places and usually you can find your\nway back to the original route. Eventually, you’ll make it to an\novergrown but very obvious forest road at around 2000'. Bushwhack your\nway to the creek on the forest road, which will put you into the creek\njust below R0, which can be skipped if desired. If looking for a bonus\nrappel, cut up from the forest road into the forest and traverse over\nuntil you find an obvious place to cut down the hillside to the creek\nabove R0.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p><strong>DCR</strong> = Down Canyon Right</p>\n<p><strong>DCL</strong> = Down Canyon Left</p>\n<p><strong>R0</strong>: 45’ from a tree in the center of the creek.</p>\n<p><strong>R1</strong>: DCR - 35’ from a tree. This rappel puts you into\na narrow crack that ends up in a tricky logjam wedged in the pool below.\nIn higher flow, this rappel could be challenging and/or hazardous. It is\npossible to downclimb/bushwhack DCR if necessary.</p>\n<p><strong>R2</strong>: 60’ from a large tree in the center of the\ncanyon. This tree requires some slippery downclimbing to reach. This\nanchor puts your rappel in the center of the creek bed with lower flow\nthan the left side (note that this line becomes funneled and pushy\ntowards the bottom in higher flows). Alternatively, before downclimbing\nto this anchor, traverse DCL and rappel 75’ from a different tree on the\ncreek bank. This puts you into the watercourse on the left side of the\ncreek, which is a much sportier line. Both of these lines drop you into\na small pool. In lower flow, climb out of the pool and downclimb through\nthe watercourse. In higher flow, climb out of the pool onto a slippery\nrock DCR to access R3.</p>\n<p><strong>R3</strong>: DCR - 30’ from a chock stone wedged in a crack.\n(This drop can be downclimbed in low water.)</p>\n<p><strong>R4</strong>: DCR - 20’ traverse line from unlinked bolts to a\n60’ rappel from a bolted anchor DCR. It is best to set rope length to\nextend over both tiers of this waterfall to avoid a slippery downclimb\nfrom the base of the falls. <strong><font color=\"red\">This anchor is\ntricky to access and manage</font></strong>, as the rock is slippery and\nsloped downwards. Teams should be familiar with how to run a hanging\nbelay &amp; transition between ropes. Please leave the traverse line\nbolts unlinked.</p>\n<p><strong>Siphon</strong>: From the bottom of R4, scramble down to\nwhere the creek disappears into a dark cave-like space under a large\npile of boulders DCL. In moderate flow or lower, you can climb down\nthrough the siphon and exit out the bottom. It is very dark so\nwaterproof headlamps are recommended. Alternatively, bypass DCR.</p>\n<p><strong>R5</strong>: 130’ low-angle ramp from the roots of an old\ntree in the center of the creek. In higher flow, the anchor can also be\nused to rappel a dry chute DCR.</p>\n<p><strong>R6</strong>: <em>The Rooster Tail</em>: 50’ from a large log\nspanning the creek. This rappel is great fun in moderate flow. In higher\nflow, this rappel is easy to bypass DCR.</p>\n<p><strong>R7</strong>: 70' from log DCR. This is a two stage rappel\nwith easy pull from DCL side. (The agile can downclimb DCL(?) using logs\nand root systems.)</p>\n<p><strong>R8</strong>: DCR - 50’ from the root of a large tree down\ninto a room between two tiers. If the flow looks too high here, there is\nan easy exit DCL that takes you out of the canyon to an easy forest walk\ndown to the road.</p>\n<p><strong>R9</strong>: DCR - 35’ from bolts. This rappel takes you into\na narrow pinch that could be a possible foot entrapment near the bottom,\nso use caution here. As of 2022 there was a large log in the drop. Might\nbe possible to downclimb the drop in low water, but use caution as it's\nslippery.</p>\n<p><strong>R10</strong>: 25’ from a log DCL. Rappel has an awkward\nstart. This drop has been downclimbed using the very large log in the\ncenter of the creek, but can be a little sketchy. This drop has two\ntiers. Rappel both tiers, or finish after the first and downclimb the\nrest.</p>\n<p><strong>R11</strong>: 45’ from a horizontal log wedged in the gravel.\nThis anchor is a bit tricky to access and may require climbing over the\nlog into an exposed position to reach/manage. This puts you at the top\nof the chute in the center of the creek. This is the last rappel in the\ncanyon.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>Climb out of the pool and walk the road back to the parking area.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<p>The northern end of Wynoochee Valley is closed seasonally from Oct 1\nthrough April 30 and is gated at approximately 47.44722, -123.55027 on\nFR 2270. (Oddly in 2023, the season was extended until November 1.)\nAccess is still legal on foot or by mountain bike.</p>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n<p>This canyon was first descended on 5/29/21 by Stephanie Moe, Becca\nPolglase, Gretchen Mallari, Zach Kiefer, Charlie Triplett, and Jake\nHuddleston. It was higher flow than expected, and the team decided to\nexit the canyon just before R7. The group returned a month later and\ncompleted the full route, joined additionally by Brent Roth and Logan\nDeGrand.</p>\n",
