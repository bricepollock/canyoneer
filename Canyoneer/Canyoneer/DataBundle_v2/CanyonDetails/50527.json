  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>This is one of 10 canyons carving up the south slope of Flores Peak.\nThese are clearly visible from the Harding Truck trail looking North\nacross Harding Canyon (Creek Bed). All are quite steep on average, and\noffer many short rappels. The last rappel of this canyon (C4) has tufa\nformations of mud, adding an interesting touch.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>Park at the Tucker Wildlife Sanctuary in Modjeska, CA. Get there\nearly; the lot fills up fast! On the North side of the parking area is\nthe gravel and dirt Harding Truck Trail gated fire road. Hike up this\n0.4 miles to the saddle, then veer left down another road 0.2 miles to\nthe Harding Creek basin. Head upstream following the use trail an\nadditional 0.9 miles to a sharp right bend in the trail. From there head\ndirectly up the ridge on the North side following the animal runs. The\nfirst few hundred feet is crazy steep dirt, but backs off after that.\nContinue up the ridge gaining 1500 feet elevation to the start\ncoordinates given.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>From the start point, head directly south down the steep dirt slope\ninto the canyon proper. Most of the canyon is steep hiking down or easy\ndry down climbing. Note that some of the down climbing will be quite\nslick if done after rain, whereas the first decent was totally bone dry.\nThere are 9 rappels; all rigged with minimal webbing anchors (thin\nwebbing on trees, bushes, 1\" climb-spec on rocks), except one rappel\nthat was ghosted by wrapping the rope directly around a large fallen\ndead tree. All the rappels are under 50 feet, most under 25 feet, except\nthe final rappel 9. Rappel 9 has no suitable direct anchor; there is a\ntree RDC but it's rooted in crumbly rock right at the edge of the drop.\nSo, rappel 8 anchor was used to get all the way down, requiring 120 feet\nrope from anchor 8 to the bottom of rap 9. Anchor 8 was built with thin\nwebbing around 2 small \"marginal\" bushes, some 60 feet apart, but mostly\ninline with the load direction. The upper bush has a 120 foot thin\nwebbing loop to rap rings and the lower bush a few feet with a Rapide.\nThe rappel rope was fed through both anchors, built equal in length so\nif one fails there will be little extension.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>After the last rappel, it's 2 minute hike to the main creek. Follow\nthe creek use trail downstream 0.6 miles and you reach the location you\nleft the trail to hike up the ridge. Reverse the approach hike back to\nyour car.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<p>None, Cleveland National Forest Service property</p>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n",
