The best section is the final KM before the Dumbano junction with deep sculpted walls consistently 1-3m wide, the KM above that still worth visiting, and then more intermittent shallow sections in the 3rd KM above the junction.\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Expect to find a number of long swims plus many log and boulder jams, some of which may require ropework to safely descend the downstream side. The canyon has been descended and ascended without ropework, but it's recommended to take a 20m rope for safety to aid with the log jams.\n<\/p><p>The Dumbano junction can be easy to miss, it comes in from behind-left while you're distracted \/ dealing with a couple of large boulders in the creek bed, passing them on the right.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Red_tape\">Red tape<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Beta_sites\">Beta sites<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media<\/h2><\/div>\n<ul><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https:\/\/ozultimate.com\/canyoning\/reports\/2015\/20150207_cesspit\/report.htm\">OzUltimate.com<\/a>&#160;: Tom Brennan Trip Report<\/li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https:\/\/ozultimate.com\/canyoning\/reports\/2015\/20150207_cesspit\/photos.htm\">OzUltimate.com<\/a>&#160;: Tom Brennan Photos<\/li><\/ul>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Background\">Background<\/h2><\/div>\n\n\n<\/div>","shuttleSeconds":null,"rappelCountMin":null,"version":"db6cdd2af39df0664d4b9aa8415539d09524d56e71d8d6d44a58a62725bcd140","rappelCountMax":null,"timeRating":null,"longitude":150.328,"months":["Oct","Nov","Dec","Jan","Feb","Mar","Apr"],"id":77646,"technicalRating":3,"permit":"No","geojson":null,"name":"Cesspit","waterRating":"B","quality":0,"vehicle":null,"rappelLongestMeters":null,"url":"https:\/\/ropewiki.com\/Cesspit"}
