The canyon has been descended and ascended without ropework, but it's recommended to take a 20m rope for safety to aid with the log jams.\n<\/p><p>The Dumbano junction can be easy to miss, it comes in from behind-left while you're distracted \/ dealing with a couple of large boulders in the creek bed, passing them on the right.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Red_tape\">Red tape<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Beta_sites\">Beta sites<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media<\/h2><\/div>\n<ul><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https:\/\/ozultimate.com\/canyoning\/reports\/2015\/20150207_cesspit\/report.htm\">OzUltimate.com<\/a>&#160;: Tom Brennan Trip Report<\/li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https:\/\/ozultimate.com\/canyoning\/reports\/2015\/20150207_cesspit\/photos.htm\">OzUltimate.com<\/a>&#160;: Tom Brennan Photos<\/li><\/ul>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Background\">Background<\/h2><\/div>\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nParsed by mw‐api‐ext.codfw.main‐6779cc57fc‐xk69j\nCached time: 20240914191827\nCache expiry: 2592000\nReduced expiry: false\nComplications: [show‐toc]\nCPU time usage: 0.005 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.006 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 21\/1000000\nPost‐expand include size: 0\/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 0\/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 2\/100\nExpensive parser function count: 0\/500\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0\/20\nUnstrip post‐expand size: 0\/5000000 bytes\nNumber of Wikibase entities loaded: 0\/400\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%    0.000      1 -total\n-->\n<\/div>","rappelCountMax":null,"timeRating":null,"id":77646,"geojson":null,"vehicle":null,"version":"dc2e0a85024b30a77f33bee0026b0b2924e93d71d8ee1e24a57206d76402f680","riskRating":null,"rappelCountMin":null,"shuttleSeconds":null,"technicalRating":3,"url":"https:\/\/ropewiki.com\/Cesspit","permit":"No","longitude":150.328,"months":["Oct","Nov","Dec","Jan","Feb","Mar","Apr"],"rappelLongestMeters":null,"name":"Cesspit","quality":0}
