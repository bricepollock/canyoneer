  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>This canyon is described in limited detail in Canyons Near Sydney by\nRick Jamieson. Help the Australian canyoning community by contributing\ntrack notes to ropewiki.com</p>\n<p>A high quality canyon, despite its name. The best section is the\nfinal KM before the Dumbano junction with deep sculpted walls\nconsistently 1-3m wide, the KM above that still worth visiting, and then\nmore intermittent shallow sections in the 3rd KM above the junction.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>Expect to find a number of long swims plus many log and boulder jams,\nsome of which may require ropework to safely descend the downstream\nside. The canyon has been descended and ascended without ropework, but\nit's recommended to take a 20m rope for safety to aid with the log\njams.</p>\n<p>The Dumbano junction can be easy to miss, it comes in from\nbehind-left while you're distracted / dealing with a couple of large\nboulders in the creek bed, passing them on the right.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><img src=\"rwl_en.png\" title=\"rwl_en.png\" alt=\"rwl_en.png\" /><a\nhref=\"https://ozultimate.com/canyoning/reports/2015/20150207_cesspit/report.htm\">OzUltimate.com</a>\n: Tom Brennan Trip Report</li>\n<li><img src=\"rwl_en.png\" title=\"rwl_en.png\" alt=\"rwl_en.png\" /><a\nhref=\"https://ozultimate.com/canyoning/reports/2015/20150207_cesspit/photos.htm\">OzUltimate.com</a>\n: Tom Brennan Photos</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n",
