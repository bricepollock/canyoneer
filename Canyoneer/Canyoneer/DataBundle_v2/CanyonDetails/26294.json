  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>Kaumana Cave (easily findable on Google Maps) is a very fun and long\nlava tube in residential Hilo, part of a county park. The primary\nentrance is down a set of concrete steps across the street from the\nparking area into a large skylight (tube collapse). From there you can\ntravel upstream a little over a quarter mile, past several skylights, or\ndownstream a little more than a half mile, to another exit on Edita St.\nMost of the cave is remarkably free from breakdown (particularly the\nlower part). Tree roots grow down from the ceiling in amazing\nquantities, at times creating curtains you need to push through. The\nlava tube formed from a large flow in 1881, so it is relatively quite\nyoung. Be careful leaving anything in your car at the parking lot --\nbreak-ins are reportedly a problem.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a\nhref=\"https://rpif.asu.edu/LTdatabase/images/Kaumana&amp;Thurston_Caves.jpg\">Map\nof Kaumana Cave</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a\nhref=\"http://traveltips.usatoday.com/full-description-kaumana-caves-hawaii-104935.html\">Article\nin USA Today</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n<p>Kaumana cave has 1.4 miles of surveyed passage.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.cavebooks.com/nl/crfaug2000.pdf\">CRF Hawaii 2000\nreport pg 6</a></p>\n"
