class=\"mw-content-ltr mw-parser-output\" lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><p>In this canyon resides a troll named Hager. We can't wait for you to meet him. Most of the time he's a jolly and mischievous fellow that likes to dunk you into pools and tug at your feet. Be wary of his dark side though, he is a troll after all. \n<\/p><p>Hager Canyon, aka Sick Puppy canyon is a great canyon in the Gifford Pinchot National Forest near Packwood, WA. This canyon is a waterpark filled with slides, jumps, and beautiful scenery. However, groups should not underestimate the hydraulic hazards in this canyon and the technical ropework needed to complete the lower section. Special challenges include rigging retrievable traverse lines (with intermediate points), recirculating hydraulics that can be difficult to escape from if trapped, and rappels that require careful and confident footwork\/balance. The canyon has highly carved features despite not being a very deep canyon, and the number of slides in the creek is very impressive. The canyon transitions from a water park in the upper and middle sections to technical ropework in the bottom section. All canyoneers running this canyon should be confident swimmers.  \nUse low-impact canyon travel by staying in the watercourse, below the flood line.\n<\/p><p><b>Driving Directions<\/b>: From Highway 12, turn onto <b>NF-48<\/b> (46.58867, -121.68681) to access the canyon. This road is across the street from the Crest Trail Lodge and is easy to miss. (Google Maps lies and may try to route you via NF-21 further south which does not actually connect to NF-48.) Drive up NF-48 for 2.8mi and park at the second switchback (46.58631, -121.65515). If you are planning to take the lower exit, drop a shuttle car at the first switchback (46.58969, -121.66427). \n<\/p><p><b>Drainage area<\/b>: 4.22mi^2. Highest elevation point for the drainage is around ~5000 ft. Given the volume of water that pumps through year-round, it's highly likely Hager is spring-fed.\n<\/p><p><b>Waterflow<\/b>: The gauge (USGS:14231900 Cispus River AB Yellowjacket Creek) will give a good projection of waterflow during normal season (July - October). However, during summer when heavy snow melt is occurring, it can be unreliable due to its smaller catchment and lower snow amounts compared to other gauged rivers nearby. Hager seems to be run comfortably by most groups by the beginning of August. A number of springs in the upper drainage maintain good water well into the season.\n<\/p><p>\"Upper Upper Section\": The section of creek between Hager Lake and the main canyon was run in 2021. While scenic, it does not have the same beauty and fun factor as the lower canyon, though it does include a beautiful 80' vertical rappel.\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>From the parking area, head uphill into the forest and skirt the edge of the creek for several hundred feet along an obvious use trail.

The purpose of the traverse line is to avoid slipping into the chute, which funnels into a narrow and dangerous keeper hydraulic. Canyoneers have gotten trapped in this hydraulic, so extreme caution should be taken to avoid it, or to aid a stuck teammate. This drop has been done as a slide. <b>If you intend to rappel or slide into the boil, a teammate should be positioned at the bottom to provide a rescue if a teammate becomes stuck.<\/b> \n<b><\/b>\n<link rel=\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\" href=\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1062633282\"> \n<\/p>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\">\n<div style=\"display:table;\">\n<span class=\"mw-default-size\" typeof=\"mw:Error mw:File\/Frameless\">\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<link rel=\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\" href=\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1062633282\"> \n<div class=\"thumb tright\">\n<div style=\"display:table;\">\n<span class=\"mw-default-size\" typeof=\"mw:Error mw:File\/Frameless\">\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<link rel=\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\" href=\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1062633282\"> \n<div class=\"thumb tright\">\n<div style=\"display:table;\">\n<span class=\"mw-default-size\" typeof=\"mw:Error mw:File\/Frameless\">\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>The tier directly after R10 is very shallow.

The route out was well-marked in 2023. Once out of the drainage, contour left\/west to pick up the obvious trail. Follow it downhill to a minor saddle at approx. 46.59072, -121.66043.

The canyon took multiple trips and attempts to complete the entirety of the main route due to early season high flows and hydraulic hazards. This canyon has been described as \"cute and cuddly, with teeth\" due to its very fun and seemingly innocuous nature.
