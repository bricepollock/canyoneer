class=\"mw-content-ltr mw-parser-output\" lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><p>This short, fun canyon is one of the best in the Oregon coastal range. Visit in the early season to see it with good flow. Stafford usually becomes beginner-friendly by May-June. Later in the summer, the flow likely reduces to a trickle. A great early season creek for training and practice.\n<\/p>\n<ul><li>Watershed: 1.25mi^2.<\/li><\/ul>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading3\"><h3 id=\"Best_Practices\">Best Practices<\/h3><\/div>\n<p>Stafford has been seeing increased visitation and is showing signs of abuse.  Please use anchors in or adjacent to the watercourse.  Climbing to trees higher up on the sides is attractive, but risks trampling vegetation and eroding the banks.  Riparian environments in the Pacific NW are extremely fragile.\n<\/p>\n<ul><li>Teaching people to rappel for the first time in an aquatic canyon is not a good plan.  It's much safer to become fully proficient with rappel devices in a dry, controlled environment outside the canyon.<\/li><\/ul>\n<ul><li>Wrapping the rope around trees for a two strand rappel is efficient, but isn't good for the tree when you go to pull your rope.  Friction damage around the back of the tree cuts into the bark.  Done too many times by too many people and the tree will become girdled and eventually die.  It's kinder to the tree to set an anchor or use a retrievable system.<\/li><\/ul>\n<ul><li>Two strand rappelling (as is done in alpine climbing) can be dangerous in aquatic canyons for a number of reasons.  There is no easy way to lower a rappeller who becomes stuck on the rope in the middle of the pitch (ex: jammed descender).  Getting stuck under a high-flow waterfall can be life-threatening.<\/li><\/ul>\n<ul><li>Beginners \"leading\" beginners is a common cause of accidents in canyoneering.<\/li><\/ul>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Follow Hwy 6 from Portland and turn off onto Larch Mountain \/ Drift Creek Rd.  Drive down the hill, cross the bridge, and bear left at the junction to find a large parking area. From here, shuttle (or hike) 3.8mi up to the top, where you'll drop in via Stafford's eastern tributary. \n<\/p>\n<ul><li>If you don't have a shuttle, you can park at 45.624194, -123.418314. You can follow the old logging road\/SE from there to the fork and then follow it E then NE to the creek.  You will drop in a bit upstream from R4 for the shorter more technical section of the canyon.  When you've completed the canyon walk back up the road about 9\/10th of a mile past the bridge and then cut in on that old logging road\/trail at 45.624433, -123.421808.  It is a good well-traveled trail and will lead you back to the trail intersection where you turned E after heading SE from your car.  Please, please DO NOT use the mountain bike trails.  The Forest Service and the mountain bikers very much do not want pedestrians on those mountain bike trails, it's very dangerous.<\/li>\n<li>Update 2024: A sign near the trailhead seemed to imply someone local is offering shuttles up to the top.<\/li>\n<li>Be aware that target shooters occasionally set up shop along the road.<\/li>\n<li>Hide your dry clothes bags to reduce the chance of vehicle break in.<\/li>\n<li>You can park the lower shuttle up on the highway in one of the pullouts to potentially reduce the risk of a break in.<\/li><\/ul>\n<p>At the upper parking area, locate the big metal culvert that passes under the road and follow the use-trail that drops into the drainage.  Follow it along the DCR \/ north side of the creek to bypass a small logjam, then drop in just below it.
