{"permit":"No","name":"Helion Creek","rappelCountMin":4,"shuttleSeconds":null,"latitude":45.1696,"rappelLongestMeters":33.53,"description":"<div class=\"mw-content-ltr mw-parser-output\" lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><p>This creek was overrun by the Riverside Fire (major wildfire) in Sept 2020 and is now open. Be mindful and aware that the terrain was severely burned. The beta will be different as a result. \n<\/p><p>Helion is a most-of-a-day adventure down one of the tributaries that feed into the Clackamas River. The waterfalls are located in the last half mile of the canyon. Given that the exit requires crossing the Clackamas river, it is a seldom visited canyon.  Typical of the canyons in the area the hike down the drainage is a watch every step, go slow kind of thing where you must negotiate slippery rocks, fallen logs and false forest floors made up of rotten trees, leaves, moss, fungus, lichen and other fallen tree detritus.  It is a splendid rain forest trek through a magnificent green oasis.\n<\/p><p>This canyon is best done in spring, by summer it will low in water. The canyon is open and most rappels can be rigged out of the water or bypassed, so it can be run even in high water conditions. The most dangerous spot may be the river crossing, which can also can be bypassed by exiting along the edge of the river with minor rock scrambling.\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>The canyon can be done with a shuttle or hiking up from the bottom. The map shows both options. The hike from the bottom is not too bad, only 600ft elevation gain and minor bushwhacking.  To get started: walk into the Armstrong Campground and keep going down the paved road until you come to a very obvious and steep dirt trail leading up the hillside on your right.  This is the best access point as it doesn't involve hiking through anyone's campsite.  Follow the trail up until it gives out (2min), then go crosscountry uphill wherever is easiest.  Just keep going up until you intersect the old road and follow it west to Helion Creek.  It's a good idea to put wetsuits on at the road, then thrash down to find the creek.  Go downstream 5min to R1.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading3\"><h3 id=\"Older_Shuttle_Approach\">Older Shuttle Approach<\/h3><\/div>\n<p>This road has been closed at the bridge since the 2015 forest fire swept through the area.  There is no sign that the Powers That Be are planning to reopen it any time soon.\n<\/p><p>To approach with a shuttle, after dropping off a shuttle vehicle head up highway 224 (Clackamas River highway) for 4.35 miles and turn left onto Forest Road 45.  Drive this road approximately 3.1 miles to a junction where decomissioned Forest Road 340 heads to the left.  There is a parking area located at this junction with parking room for at least three vehicles.  Forest Road 340 has multiple piles of dirt and asphalt debris that block further vehicle travel.  Walk this road for about 1.6 miles.  You will come to a faint road junction, stay to the right and walk another .10 miles down a more narrow road.  This road is also covered with small piles of dirt, some with planted seedlings.  This road leads to the edge of the Helion drainage.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>R1: 95'\n<\/p><p>5-10min bushwhack\n<\/p><p>R2: 115'\n<\/p><p>5-10min bushwhack\n<\/p><p>R3: 45'\n<\/p><p>5-10min bushwhack\n<\/p><p>R4: 25' ( 45' back to the anchor) down a low-angle chute.  \n<\/p><p>All of the waterfall rappels are straight forward from trees.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Before heading up to run the canyon, it's a good idea to check out how high the Clackamas River is running.  There are several options to consider based on water levels:\n<\/p><p>a. Bushwhack upstream to reach the Carter Bridge and walk the road back to your car.\n<\/p><p>b. Bringing a packraft to paddle across stream or arrange to have a raft waiting.\n<\/p><p>c. Swim the river one at a time, employing ferry angle technique.  This is should only be done in summer low water conditions and if you know what you're doing.  Having a throw rope at the ready downstream in case someone gets swept may be a good idea. During mid-late summer conditions this should be an easy swim or float and is even possible to walk across on tiptoes.\n<\/p><p>Note that this swim\/float is a mere 100yds downstream to a large rocky bend that is an easy exit and then a 1min hike to the bottom parking.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Red_tape\">Red tape<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>None.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Hazards\">Hazards<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Beware copious amounts of poison oak under the bridge adjacent to the Armstrong Campground.
