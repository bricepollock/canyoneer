Summit Creek enters a few pretty cool looking granite gorges.  However, the flow is kept artificially high through the summer by Relief Reservoir.  \n<\/p><p>With the gauge downstream of the confluence with Kennedy running at 52 cfs (maybe ~35 of this in Summit), we though that the flow in Summit Creek looked high enough that any of the potentially fun obstacles would have to be bypassed, making it less worthwhile as a canyoneering trip.  Could be interesting to check out in a drought year.\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Red_tape\">Red tape<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Beta_sites\">Beta sites<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Background\">Background<\/h2><\/div>\n\n\n<\/div>","technicalRating":3,"quality":0,"months":["Jul","Aug","Sep","Oct"],"timeRating":"II","riskRating":"X","url":"https:\/\/ropewiki.com\/Summit_Creek","rappelCountMax":null,"id":38487,"geojson":null,"rappelLongestMeters":null,"version":"f0b7311fb569c85695402bf504938fee66c146e5db3783a682a2708f191b37ec","name":"Summit Creek","shuttleSeconds":null,"latitude":38.2909,"waterRating":"C4"}
