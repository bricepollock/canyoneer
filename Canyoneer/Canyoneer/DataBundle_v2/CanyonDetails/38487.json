  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>If you hike up to Kennedy Creek for canyoneering, you will pass by\nSummit Creek in the process. Summit Creek enters a few pretty cool\nlooking granite gorges. However, the flow is kept artificially high\nthrough the summer by Relief Reservoir.</p>\n<p>With the gauge downstream of the confluence with Kennedy running at\n52 cfs (maybe ~35 of this in Summit), we though that the flow in Summit\nCreek looked high enough that any of the potentially fun obstacles would\nhave to be bypassed, making it less worthwhile as a canyoneering trip.\nCould be interesting to check out in a drought year.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n"
