It's got a few short down-climbs and a 120-130' rappel at the end. Probably not worth the effort to get to it from the top from the Lukens Fire road. If you really want to do this route I'd recommend approaching from the bottom and going up the gully at 34.2407, -118.1913. This will put you above the rappel and only technical part of the canyon. It will also avoid most if not all of the poison oak\/bushwhacking. If you do this option (approaching from the bottom) the entire route will probably only be an hour or so.\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Red_tape\">Red tape<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Beta_sites\">Beta sites<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media<\/h2><\/div>\n<ul><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external free\" href=\"http:\/\/360nomad.org\/brownside-canyon-its-all-in-the-name\/\">http:\/\/360nomad.org\/brownside-canyon-its-all-in-the-name\/<\/a><\/li><\/ul>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Background\">Background<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>\"Brownside\". Hours upon hours staring at topo maps looking for canyon prospects near home I cam across \"Brown Canyon\", labeled such on the topos. It didn't look like the squiggly contour lines were coming very close together indicating it might not be too technical, that is it might just be a long steep slope with some downclimbs. But wait...there's a canyon coming down the side...and going with what Brennan started in his naming of \"Silver On The Side\" I figured \"Brownside\" would be appropriate.\n<\/p><p>So on a hot summer morning about a week ago Dave Red &amp; I headed up the trail and after 3 miles of unrelenting heat we dropped into the canyon, the bushwhack was immediate. As if the heat and bushwhacking wasn't enough so came the poison oak and introduced itself, all too happy and thriving.\n<\/p><p>A few hours later and near the end of the canyon we arrived at the first obstacle, a downclimb followed shortly by a rappel which turned out to be about 120ft. So much pain and trouble for 1 average rappel. \"Well at least I know what's in here and don't have to come back\" I kept telling myself through the bushwhack.\n<\/p><p>All this time I had no idea that \"Brownside\" is a Chicano hip-hop group started by Eazy-E. The more you know. \n<\/p><p><a href=\"\/w\/index.php?title=User:A._Anderson&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"User:A. Anderson (page does not exist)\">A.
