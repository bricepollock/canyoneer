  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>A lot of bushwhacking and poison oak in this canyon. It's got a few\nshort down-climbs and a 120-130' rappel at the end. Probably not worth\nthe effort to get to it from the top from the Lukens Fire road. If you\nreally want to do this route I'd recommend approaching from the bottom\nand going up the gully at 34.2407, -118.1913. This will put you above\nthe rappel and only technical part of the canyon. It will also avoid\nmost if not all of the poison oak/bushwhacking. If you do this option\n(approaching from the bottom) the entire route will probably only be an\nhour or so.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a\nhref=\"http://360nomad.org/brownside-canyon-its-all-in-the-name/\">http://360nomad.org/brownside-canyon-its-all-in-the-name/</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n<p>\"Brownside\". Hours upon hours staring at topo maps looking for canyon\nprospects near home I cam across \"Brown Canyon\", labeled such on the\ntopos. It didn't look like the squiggly contour lines were coming very\nclose together indicating it might not be too technical, that is it\nmight just be a long steep slope with some downclimbs. But\nwait...there's a canyon coming down the side...and going with what\nBrennan started in his naming of \"Silver On The Side\" I figured\n\"Brownside\" would be appropriate.</p>\n<p>So on a hot summer morning about a week ago Dave Red &amp; I headed\nup the trail and after 3 miles of unrelenting heat we dropped into the\ncanyon, the bushwhack was immediate. As if the heat and bushwhacking\nwasn't enough so came the poison oak and introduced itself, all too\nhappy and thriving.</p>\n<p>A few hours later and near the end of the canyon we arrived at the\nfirst obstacle, a downclimb followed shortly by a rappel which turned\nout to be about 120ft. So much pain and trouble for 1 average rappel.\n\"Well at least I know what's in here and don't have to come back\" I kept\ntelling myself through the bushwhack.</p>\n<p>All this time I had no idea that \"Brownside\" is a Chicano hip-hop\ngroup started by Eazy-E. The more you know.</p>\n<p><a href=\"User:A._Anderson\" title=\"wikilink\">A. Anderson</a> (<a\nhref=\"User_talk:A._Anderson\" title=\"wikilink\">talk</a>) 17:17, 19 August\n2014 (PDT)</p>\n"
