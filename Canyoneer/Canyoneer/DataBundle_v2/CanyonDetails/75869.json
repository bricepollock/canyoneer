  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>A good beginner canyon close to Blackheath that can be done\nyear-round thanks to negligible water flow and abseil anchors situated\nout of the flow. 7 abseils with only 2 mandatory. Canyon now extends to\ninclude Beauchamp Falls.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Quality</em></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The canyon is rated 4 out of 10 on the Brennan Quality Scale.</li>\n<li>David Noble rates the canyon 2 out of 5 for quality and Easy-Medium\nfor difficulty.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<h3 id=\"by_car\">By car</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Parking spot located on Old Point Pilcher Trail at -33.664359,\n150.324937 accessed via Point Pilcher Road, Medlow Bath</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"by_foot\">By foot</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Walk north east along fire trail, which turns north</li>\n<li>Once you reach a star picket -33.659410, 150.327579 turn off Old\nPoint Pilcher Trail and follow a faint track towards the start of the\ncanyon at -33.659171, 150.329443</li>\n<li>Older track notes describe turning right at “a large live tree with\na couple of holes burnt by fire in the trunk”. This description is now\npartially out of date due to the 2019-2020 Bushfires. The tree remains\nhowever is now completely burnt and may be difficult to discern amongst\nall the other burnt trees.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"map\">Map</h3>\n\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Simple and straightforward canyon with up to 7 abseils.</li>\n<li>Wetsuits are optional</li>\n<li>All but 2 abseils are optional and can be scrambled around/down</li>\n<li>Distances between abseils are not large (no more than 100m excluding\nlast abseil)</li>\n<li>Route is well worn and easy to follow</li>\n<li>Canyon does not have any significant water flow and can be done year\nround as a “dry” canyon</li>\n<li>The pool at base of R4 can be avoided by edging along some very\nsmall ledges on the river right</li>\n<li>6m hand over hand climb down between R5 and R6</li>\n</ul>\n<figure>\n<embed src=\"Jugglers_v3a1II.pdf\" title=\"Jugglers_v3a1II.pdf\" />\n<figcaption>Jugglers_v3a1II.pdf</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>At the bottom of Beauchamp Falls (R7) head upwards on river left\n(about 20m to the right of Beauchamp Falls) to find an old, unmaintained\ntrack just below the cliffs. Follow the cliff path back to the top of\nBeauchamp Falls, and upward.</li>\n<li>Keeping river left, after about 150m the path will meet the larger\nRodriguez Pass Walking Trail. Follow this maintained path until it\nintersects with the Grand Canyon Walking Trail (signpost).</li>\n<li>Head upstream along the Grand Canyon Walking Trail until you reach\nthe Old Point Pilcher Walking Track turn off, on the left when walking\nupstream at approx -33.657267, 150.324350. The Pilcher track turns off\nthe main Grand Canyon trail at the point where the Grand Canyon trail\nleaves the river to climb up the cliffs (the same place as the Grand\nCanyon canyon trip exit). Find the Pilcher trail near to the river as\nthe Grand Canyon trail leaves the river. If you follow the Grand [\nCanyon trail up the steps out of the river, you have gone too far.</li>\n<li>Proceed up through the cliffs and along Old Point Pilcher Walking\nTrack on a well-cleared path. Pass the canyon entry path turnoff, and\nreturn to the car park.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a\nhref=\"https://www.nationalparks.nsw.gov.au/things-to-do/adventure-sports-experiences/jugglers-canyon\">https://www.nationalparks.nsw.gov.au/things-to-do/adventure-sports-experiences/jugglers-canyon</a></li>\n<li><a\nhref=\"https://ozultimate.com/canyoning/track_notes/jugglers.htm\">https://ozultimate.com/canyoning/track_notes/jugglers.htm</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<p>{{#ev:youtube|cUz-9BG2jPI}}</p>\n<ul>\n<li><img src=\"rwl_en.png\" title=\"rwl_en.png\" alt=\"rwl_en.png\" /><a\nhref=\"https://youtu.be/MNEnz9TQmyg\">YouTube.com</a> : Richard Pattison,\nJugglers Canyon movie</li>\n</ul>\n<p>{{#ev:youtube|MNEnz9TQmyg}}</p>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n<p>First known exploration by Stephen (Frank) Bray, Louise De Beuzeville\n(the juggler) and Justin Blows on a SUBW trip circa 1993.
