The Pilcher track turns off the main Grand Canyon trail at the point where the Grand Canyon trail leaves the river to climb up the cliffs (the same place as the Grand Canyon canyon trip exit). Find the Pilcher trail near to the river as the Grand Canyon trail leaves the river. If you follow the Grand [ Canyon trail up the steps out of the river, you have gone too far.<\/li>\n<li>Proceed up through the cliffs and along Old Point Pilcher Walking Track on a well-cleared path.
