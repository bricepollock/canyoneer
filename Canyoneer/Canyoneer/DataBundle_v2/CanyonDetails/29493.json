Continue to the top of the road with the entrance vehicle. The road is paved at the beginning but becomes gravel in the latter half. Passager cars should be sufficient to reach the top but have a spare tire with you (the rocks are small but sharp). Park at the hiking trailhead (road ends). You can see the spring that feeds Fontalba from the trailhead; follow the obvious hiking path towards it and then turn down canyon and walk along the stream until you see R1. There is a wide, grassy area to put on wetsuits.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>R1 is LDC from bolts.\n<\/p><p>R2 is LDC from a tree; this rappel can be skipped but it is set to protect the descent out to R3.\n<\/p><p>R3 is RDC from bolts. There is a fixed bolt at the bottom to set a guideline in higher flow.\n<\/p><p>There are several rappels from trees that can be set or walked\/climbed around. This will depend on water levels and group ability.\n<\/p><p>Final rappel: There is a tree RDC that can be used to protect the approach to the final rappel. For the final rappel, there are two bolted options. The LDC bolts can be seen from the tree (diagonal) and decend partially out of the water course. The RDC bolts cannot be seen and are located on the rock that can be rappeled over\/around from the tree. The RDC bolts are in the direct water course.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Scramble down from the final rappel pool and retainer wall. Cross the train tracks, exit through the gate, and change out of wetsuits in the wide, gravel area. The trail through the tunnel (no train tracks and sloping downhill) is the exit, which stays on the wide trail\/road the entire time.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Red_tape\">Red tape<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>You might be asked to pay to drive your shuttle car to the top parking lot. Bring 5 € since this is a possibility on summer weekends.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Beta_sites\">Beta sites<\/h2><\/div>\n<ul><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http:\/\/rocjumper.com\/barranco\/torrent-de-fontalba\">RocJumper.com<\/a> &#160;: Torrent de Fontalba v4a4I (Queralbs; Girona) Acuático<\/li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external free\" href=\"http:\/\/passport.aventure.free.fr\/affichage.php3?selcny=FONT%20ALBA%20(TORRENT)\">http:\/\/passport.aventure.free.fr\/affichage.php3?selcny=FONT%20ALBA%20(TORRENT)<\/a><\/li><\/ul>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media<\/h2><\/div>\n<ul><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http:\/\/wikiloc.com\/wikiloc\/view.do?id=10840172\">Wikiloc.com<\/a> &#160;: Torrent de Fontalba by RocJumper<\/li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http:\/\/wikiloc.com\/wikiloc\/view.do?id=10243000\">Wikiloc.com<\/a> &#160;: Aproximación al Torrent de Fontalba<\/li><\/ul>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Background\">Background<\/h2><\/div>\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nParsed by mw‐api‐ext.codfw.main‐6779cc57fc‐vfk2q\nCached time: 20240914192125\nCache expiry: 2592000\nReduced expiry: false\nComplications: [show‐toc]\nCPU time usage: 0.005 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.006 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 21\/1000000\nPost‐expand include size: 0\/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 0\/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 2\/100\nExpensive parser function count: 0\/500\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0\/20\nUnstrip post‐expand size: 0\/5000000 bytes\nNumber of Wikibase entities loaded: 0\/400\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%    0.000      1 -total\n-->\n<\/div>","waterRating":"C","vehicle":"Passenger","technicalRating":4,"rappelCountMax":null,"id":29493,"rappelCountMin":null,"latitude":42.3669,"longitude":2.1516,"url":"https:\/\/ropewiki.com\/Fontalba","version":"58d5491a29255d3187dd21ff14e24dd63110b620175c2d5d1609d8b0d6b67bfd","rappelLongestMeters":60,"name":"Fontalba","geojson":null,"permit":"No","riskRating":null,"timeRating":"II"}
