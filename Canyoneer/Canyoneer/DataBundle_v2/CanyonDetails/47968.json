  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>Great Falls Creek is a huge drainage in the Absaroka-Beartooth\nWilderness. From the high-Alpine lakes at 9,400 feet in elevation down\nto the 6,000 foot level the creek is relatively low-angle and choked\nwith logs. Below the 6,000 foot level is where the big action is. This\nis a big water canyon until August most years. Easy trail approach. Easy\ntrail exit. 6 solid waterfall rappels including the monster Great Falls\n(rappel #5) and Trinity Falls (rappel #6). The \"R\" rating is for the big\nboils at the bottom of Great Falls and at each tier in Trinity Falls.\nPlease bring bear spray. They are very present on the trail to the\ncanyon.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>Stop at Great Falls creek parking lot. Walk up the trail and follow\nthe signs. The trail from the parking lot will be a lot of sustained\nuphill. Expect this to be a 30 minute walk. If you're fit and\ndetermined, you'll be there in 20. The trail will begin to switch back\nby Great Falls creek. Take the steep dirt deer trail that goes straight\nto the creek. At the bottom you will find the optional first rap above\nyou (title photo).</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>The descent of Trinity Falls canyon is fast and wet. From the\noptional first rap, move down the creek, jumping fallen trees and\nworking around small drops. About 150 meters from start you will come to\nthe comment section. Rap 2 (8 feet) leads immediately into rap 3 (the\ngreat falls rappel 40 feet). It is not advised to attempt the direct\nwater flow if the creek appears to be running high. You can do rap 3 off\nsome trees to the descenders left. Be mindful of the boil. Below rap 3\nis the \"pinball alley\". Pinball alley is a short 50 meters filled with\nsmall jumpable falls. This is also the \"narrows\" of the canyon. Pinball\nalley terminates into rap 4 (20 feet) and then into the beginning of\nTrinity Falls. Rap 5 (40 feet) drops into a small grotto that terminates\ninto rap 6 and 7 (25 feet and 25 feet, can be done as one 55 foot\nrappel). Do NOT descend Trinity Falls if there's high CFS. The boil\nbetween rap 6 and 7 is very committing and particularly violent. Rap 6\nand 7 can be cheated with a climbing traverse to a tree on the\ndescenders right at the grotto. Rappel 7 is the final rappel and drops\nyou into a lively grotto with some geocaches.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>The main exit is after rappel 7 at the grotto. Walk up the ridge on\nthe descenders right. The trail begins very defined, but slowly\ndisappears. Continue up the steep ridge until you reach the Great Falls\ntrail. Emergency exits do exit in the canyon descent. Between rap 2 and\n3 an exit exists on the descenders left. The exit does not provide much\nsafety from its exposure above rap 3, so be mindful and careful. The\nsecond emergency exit is at the bottom of rappel 4 (above Trinity\nFalls). It is on the descenders left. It is a small exposed 5.3 climb,\nless than 10 feet.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n",
