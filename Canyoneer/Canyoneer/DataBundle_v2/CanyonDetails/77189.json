Proceed\nwestwards from the lookout along a defined track. The track finds a\ngulley, then descends down to Jerrara Creek.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>Proceed down canyon referring to the canyon topo for details on\nproblems* you will encounter along the canyon</p>\n<figure>\n<embed src=\"Jerrara_Canyon.pdf\" title=\"Jerrara_Canyon.pdf\" />\n<figcaption>Jerrara_Canyon.pdf</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p><small>*A \"problem\" is a notable geographical feature that prevents\nyour progression through the canyon. Often engaging with a problem is\nmandatory (e.g. an abseil in a slot canyon where no alternate route\nexists), but occasionally they are optional and can be bypassed via an\nalternate route in the canyon.</small></p>\n<p>If you notice any inaccuracies with the canyon topo please contact\nthe author.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>Exit to the canyon is via the \"Red Route\":</p>\n<p>After the final abseil, follow the river downstream. At first\nprogress is slow through the boulders and pools. After a long, narrowish\npool walk on the right bank to find vague paths along the valley floor.\nThe canyon twists right, then sharp left. Find the red route track river\nright. On the brochure map, this is where the red route descends to the\nriver, to the west of the marked \"Slot Canyon\". Proceed up the red route\nfrom here. Do not follow the red route along the river through the \"Slot\nCanyon\" (unless you want a very long day). Note that there is good water\nat the bottom of the red route (where you exit) from a natural\nspring.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color:red\"> <strong>The scramble up the ridge between\nJerrara Creek and Bungonia Creek is extremely dangerous.</strong></span>\nItâ€™s friable rotten shaley stuff with scrub and a sheer drop onto\nJerrara falls. The bushs are too weak and poorly rooted to build\nanchors, and the rock is too rotten for natural pro. And the whole time\nyou are ascending a steep ridge above the waterfall with nothing to\narrest a fall if you lose it.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a\nhref=\"https://ozultimate.com/canyoning/track_notes/jerrara_creek.htm\">https://ozultimate.com/canyoning/track_notes/jerrara_creek.htm</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><img src=\"rwl_en.png\" title=\"rwl_en.png\" alt=\"rwl_en.png\" /><a\nhref=\"https://youtu.be/l0jCQja3Cr8\">YouTube.com</a> : Richard Pattison,\nJerrara Creek Canyon movie</li>\n</ul>\n<p>{{#ev:youtube|l0jCQja3Cr8}}</p>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n",
