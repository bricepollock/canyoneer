  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>This canyon was first scouted by Time Burke and Melinda Muckenthaler\nin 2015. They initially thought the big drop, Cracken Falls was over 300\nfeet in length. They later returned and measured it at 150 feet. The\nfirst descent team found it to be 225 in length as there is another\nsequence that is not seen from the neighboring ridge. That being said,\nthis is a fun Oregon canyon with 2 really exciting sections of\nwaterfalls and a nice red bedrock walk in between the two.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>Drive the 2041 up to 44.4573818, -122.2366880 and park along the\nroad. The road is in good shape and the area is actively getting logged\nso be mindful of logging trucks. It is advised to use a shuttle and to\npark one vehicle at 44.4390250, -122.2538313. The approach has a nice\ngame trail that takes you to the creek.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>R1- 50' Boulder DCL - check webbing for abrasion. walk 200 feet to\nthe next section.</p>\n<p>R2- 100' Tree DCL - 2 stage with a hanging pothole in between and\nland into a nice slot section.</p>\n<p>R3- 20' Log in creek</p>\n<p>3/4 mile easy bedrock stroll</p>\n<p>R4- 225' \"Cracken Falls\" Log in creek - This may be broken up by\nsetting up an anchor on a log on the last sequence. We did NOT try this\nas we had enough rope. We used 240' rope.</p>\n<p>The next section is roughly 300 feet of big boulder down climbing.\nWas done successfully going DCL and DCR (via a cavelike hole in the\nground)</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>After the Boulder downclimb walk the creek, roughly 0.5mi, to the\nnext major confluence and climb roughly 100 feet up to your car. This\nsection is filled with 3-4 major log jam scrambles.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<p>None</p>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a\nhref=\"https://www.oregonhikers.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=10&amp;t=18814\">Oregonhikers\n- Scouting TR</a></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><a\nhref=\"https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=tZVRY4PEORI\">https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=tZVRY4PEORI</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n<p>This was first descended by Haruka James Clay Lipscomb, Sean Brady,\nMichelle Nilles, Isaac Fieland, and Ryan Ernst on 29 Aug 2020.</p>\n",
