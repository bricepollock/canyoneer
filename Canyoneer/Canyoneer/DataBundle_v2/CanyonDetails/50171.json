They initially thought the big drop, Cracken Falls was over 300 feet in length. They later returned and measured it at 150 feet. The first descent team found it to be 225 in length as there is another sequence that is not seen from the neighboring ridge. That being said, this is a fun Oregon canyon with 2 really exciting sections of waterfalls and a nice red bedrock walk in between the two.\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Drive the 2041 up to 44.4573818, -122.2366880 and park along the road. The road is in good shape and the area is actively getting logged so be mindful of logging trucks. It is advised to use a shuttle and to park one vehicle at 44.4390250, -122.2538313. The approach has a nice game trail that takes you to the creek.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>R1- 50' Boulder DCL - check webbing for abrasion. walk 200 feet to the next section. \n<\/p><p>R2- 100' Tree DCL - 2 stage with a hanging pothole in between and land into a nice slot section. \n<\/p><p>R3- 20' Log in creek\n<\/p><p>3\/4 mile easy bedrock stroll\n<\/p><p>R4- 225' \"Cracken Falls\" Log in creek - This may be broken up by setting up an anchor on a log on the last sequence.
