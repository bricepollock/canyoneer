  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>From ICOPro (translated from French): \"Approach 1h30 Descent 4h\nReturn 30min Shuttle ?? Quotation v4a3IV Roche Basalte Interest interest\n3.6 / 4 (9 votes) *: indication on the minimum of rope in singles.\nForesee the rope recall, the rescue rope, what to deal with the\nunexpected, etc ... Access From Fort de France take the RN 3 towards\nMorne Rouge to the place called Alma or the White River crosses the\nroad. Leave a car for the exit shuttle. Continue with the second vehicle\nto the butcher's plateau (two small houses without electricity are on\neach side of the plateau) and park. Approach Climb the Piton BOUCHER by\na very steep track on the first 200 meters of elevation. Go to the top\nof the Boucher peak by the ridge and follow towards the south towards\nMorne Lacroix. we pass several entrances of canyons signposted by PVC\ntubes on which the name appears (in the order, Basalt, Ariégeois on the\nleft hand). Then we reach a watershed at a pass of 1041 meters. The\nattack is on the left hand side to the east at a tangle of mangles\nMountains. Descent A first part in the vegetation with water arriving\ngradually (because of the departure at the top of the watershed) A\nsecond vertical part more open with a sequence of large rappels between\n30 and 40 meters. A third part more aquatic and cashed with a larger\nhorizontal progression.\"</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>The rail is the same as for many of the canyons along that mountain.\nFollow it as you climb steeply, using landlines and roots for pulling\nyourself up the near vertical approach. You will past a little water\nstation fenced area, and one more pitch to reach the drop in. A pic grey\npipe with \"ALMA\" crudely etched is your starting point. It will be on\nthe left. There are also other canyons near the same spot. Make sure you\ndrop into the one marked correctly.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>The canyon falls away very steeply with beautiful views and vertical\nrappels. It is well bolted.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>There is a large cairn to mark the exit, and an east trail which\ntakes you to the road. The car park area is just down the road at the\ndam/bridge.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><img src=\"rwl_fr.png\" title=\"rwl_fr.png\" alt=\"rwl_fr.png\" /><a\nhref=\"http://descente-canyon.com/canyoning/canyon-description/21253\">Descente-Canyon.com</a>\n: Alma</li>\n<li><img src=\"rwl_en.png\" title=\"rwl_en.png\" alt=\"rwl_en.png\" /><a\nhref=\"http://icopro.org/canyon/view/id/107\">Icopro.org</a> : L'alma</li>\n<li><img src=\"rwl_fr.png\" title=\"rwl_fr.png\" alt=\"rwl_fr.png\" /><a\nhref=\"https://ankanionla-madinina.com/lalma-par-le-bras-des-ariegeois/\">An\nKanion La-madinina</a> : Alma; Rivière Blanche</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n",
