Foresee the rope recall, the rescue rope, what to deal with the unexpected, etc ... Access From Fort de France take the RN 3 towards Morne Rouge to the place called Alma or the White River crosses the road. Leave a car for the exit shuttle. Continue with the second vehicle to the butcher's plateau (two small houses without electricity are on each side of the plateau) and park. Approach Climb the Piton BOUCHER by a very steep track on the first 200 meters of elevation. Go to the top of the Boucher peak by the ridge and follow towards the south towards Morne Lacroix. we pass several entrances of canyons signposted by PVC tubes on which the name appears (in the order, Basalt, Ariégeois on the left hand). Then we reach a watershed at a pass of 1041 meters. The attack is on the left hand side to the east at a tangle of mangles Mountains. Descent A first part in the vegetation with water arriving gradually (because of the departure at the top of the watershed) A second vertical part more open with a sequence of large rappels between 30 and 40 meters. A third part more aquatic and cashed with a larger horizontal progression.\"\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>The rail is the same as for many of the canyons along that mountain. Follow it as you climb steeply, using landlines and roots for pulling yourself up the near vertical approach.  You will past a little water station fenced area, and one more pitch to reach the drop in. A pic grey pipe with \"ALMA\" crudely etched is your starting point. It will be on the left. There are also other canyons near the same spot. Make sure you drop into the one marked correctly.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>The canyon falls away very steeply with beautiful views and vertical rappels.
