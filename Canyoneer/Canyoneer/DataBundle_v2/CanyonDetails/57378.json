There’s no writing anywhere on it, not even Chris Brennen and we saw no signs of older anchors left behind. I still won’t presume we were the first ones to rappel these 2 falls in 2019...\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Getting There:\n<\/p><p>From the 210 freeway, take the “2 \/ Angeles Crest Hwy” exit North. Drive about 16.8 miles and turn Right (South) to “Switzer Truck Trail”. Follow to the end and park. The trailhead is at: 34.266250, -118.145719.\n<\/p><p><br \/>\nApproach:\n<\/p><p>Follow the Gabrielino Trail for 1 mile to the drop-in point near the ruins of the old Switzer-land Resort.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>The Canyon:<br \/>\nOnce you drop in it’s a very short walk to the first waterfall.

This waterfall is 80’. The first 30’ is a 45 degree slope and then it goes vertical for another 40’. In order to avoid rope pulling issues, after the group was down I wrapped the rope around the concrete post and rappelled to the middle then anchored to a small tree and rappelled the rest.<br \/>\n2.
