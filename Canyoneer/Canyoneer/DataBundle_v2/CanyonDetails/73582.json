This is a committing section of the canyon with some fun rappels, deep pools, and interesting water features. Of particular note is a terrific waterslide mid-canyon into a deep punchbowl.

The middle section of the creek linking the two is described on the Upper Fulton page.<\/li><\/ul>\n<ul><li>Watershed: 8mi^2.  Highest point in the watershed is East Rock at ~4270' elevation.

The road gets very rough after this point. High clearance recommended (maybe 4WD); use extreme caution with low-clearance 2WD vehicles.\n<\/p>\n<ul><li>Please do NOT park in the pullout at the end of the pavement. While technically legal, there are several homes very close by. Some canyon groups parking here and hiking\/carpooling up the road has led to conflicts with the local residents. To avoid problems and keep them happy, it's recommended to park elsewhere (ex: Triton Cove State Park - Discovery Pass required) and carpool to Fulton in a high-clearance vehicle.<\/li><\/ul>\n<p>At the end of the pavement, continue up the rough dirt road for another 0.3mi to a pullout on the right with room for several vehicles.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Hiking_In\">Hiking In<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>From the pullout, walk up the road about five minutes and climb over a berm onto an old logging road. Make your way through an old clear cut and descend a ridge into the canyon. As you near the tree line, bear off to your right\/north and cross a gully to the next ridge following a faint game trail.

Fulton flows big in the off-season and any webbing left in the watercourse gets completely trashed. Glance above you in the narrow canyon and you may notice the high water line is several feet over your head. A drill and bolt kit is recommended for the first team through each season.<\/li><\/ul>\n<ul><li>Giant logs have moved significantly from year-to-year, so do not rely on log anchors being present. Log jams have also been created and disappeared over the years. A small folding saw is recommended for the first team through each season.<\/li><\/ul>\n<ul><li>All jumps and slides should be scouted in advance to ensure the water is deep enough and there are no submerged obstacles. Jumping is a leading cause of canyon injury (i.e. broken ankles and legs).<\/li><\/ul>\n<ul><li>There are a number of short downclimbs that are not listed in the beta below.<\/li><\/ul>\n<ul><li>Beware running Lower Fulton early in the season as there are a number of siphons.
