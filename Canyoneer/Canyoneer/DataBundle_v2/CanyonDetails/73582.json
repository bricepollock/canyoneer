  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>This page describes the lower section of Fulton Creek. This is a\ncommitting section of the canyon with some fun rappels, deep pools, and\ninteresting water features. Of particular note is a terrific waterslide\nmid-canyon into a deep punchbowl. Lower Fulton, on its own, is probably\na half-day adventure.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Upper <a href=\"Fulton_Creek\" title=\"wikilink\">Fulton Creek</a> (aka\nClassic Fulton) is shorter separate section of the canyon and is\ndescribed on its own page. It is possible to run both the upper and\nlower sections of this creek in a single trip, but expect a much longer\nday out. The middle section of the creek linking the two is described on\nthe Upper Fulton page.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Watershed: 8mi^2. Highest point in the watershed is East Rock at\n~4270' elevation. Expect to see about twice as much water as Upper\nFulton.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>Just north of Triton Cove State Park, turn left off Hwy 101 onto\nSeamount Dr. Follow the road upwards for 1.25mi to a pullout on the\nright with room for several vehicles. Note that the road gets very rough\nafter the pavement ends. High clearance recommended; use extreme caution\nwith low-clearance 2WD vehicles.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Apparently, some canyoneers have been parking at the end of the\npavement and either hiking or carpooling up the road. While technically\nlegal to park here, there a number of private homes extremely close by\nand the presence of cars may cause locals to wonder what you're up to\nand/or suspect you're up to no good. To alleviate their concerns, it may\nbe better to park 2WD vehicles elsewhere (ex: Triton Cove State Park --\nDiscovery Pass required) and carpool up to Fulton in a high-clearance\nvehicle.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"hiking_in\">Hiking In</h2>\n<p>From the pullout, walk up the road about five minutes and climb over\na berm onto an old logging road. Make your way through an old clear cut\nand descend a ridge into the canyon. As you near the tree line, bear off\nto your right/north and cross a gully to the next ridge following a\nfaint game trail. Drop down the far side to the entrance of Lower\nFulton. R1 is a short walk downstream.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<h3 id=\"technical_notes\">Technical Notes</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>DCL = Down Canyon Left.</li>\n<li>DCR = Down Canyon Right.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Beware running Lower Fulton early in the season as there are a\nnumber of siphons. A few of the obstacles encountered could be quite\ndangerous / difficult to overcome in high water. It may not be possible\nto escape the canyon until below R6. Do not rely on log anchors being\npresent. A bolt kit and small folding saw may be recommended for the\nfirst team through in a given season.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>All jumps and slides should be scouted in advance to ensure the\nwater is deep enough and there are no submerged obstacles. Jumping is a\nleading cause of canyon injury (i.e. broken ankles and legs).</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>There are a number of short downclimbs that are not listed in the\nbeta below.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"descent_1\">Descent</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>R1:</strong> Downclimb into a pothole DCR to a log anchor.\nRappel 35ft down a cool spiraling chute into a chamber/pool underneath a\ngiant chockstone.</li>\n<li><strong>J1:</strong> 5ft drop from bottom of spiraling chute. The\nrope from R1 can be extended to scout the pool. It may be better to pull\nthe rope for R1 from the top of the jump as the water is quite deep\nbelow.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>J2:</strong> Downclimb to a shallow jump (~3ft) into a small\npool. Use caution as the pool is not deep. This likely will need to be a\nrappel in higher flow.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Make your way through a narrow low-angle trough into the next big\npool. Beyond, there's a short walk to the next obstacle.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>S1:</strong> Amazing 35ft beautiful slide, with a 6ft\nvertical drop at the bottom into a very deep punchbowl. (Or rappel from\nfallen log DCR.)</li>\n<li>Swim the pool below S1, then downclimb into the next pool. (This\nmight be a rappel depending on water levels. Also possible shallow\njump.)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A large logjam blocks the exit of the next pool. In 2022 a partner\nassist was required to climb out. More logs appeared in 2023 and a\npartner assist was not necessary. The next rappel comes immediately.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>R2:</strong> Rappel 30ft from the logjam. (If the logs blow\nout, this drop will likely require bolting. It's also possible to rappel\na short distance to a ledge and jump. (It might be possible to jump from\nthe top? Pool below was about 7ft deep in 2023.)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Just ahead, enter the giant boulder garden:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>10ft pour-over. Bypass / downclimb DCL.</li>\n<li><strong>R3:</strong> 15ft. Near the center of the boulder garden,\nrappel to a lower level DCR from a log jam.</li>\n<li>Ahead, the creek diverts in two directions around a giant\nhouse-sized boulder. The right side was an easy scramble around in\n2023.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Continue downstream for a short distance. Bear DCR to reach:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>R4:</strong> 20ft down a ramp from a single bolt DCR.</li>\n<li><strong>R5:</strong> 15ft from the top of a chockstone wedged\nbetween the canyon walls. Anchored on large tree creek-center well back\nfrom the top. Pool directly below the rap is not deep enough to jump,\nbut launching further out might be possible? (This drop might be a good\ncandidate for bolting in future.)</li>\n<li><strong>R6: <em>The Dragon's Den</em></strong>. Ahead, the creek\nappears to be blocked by a huge boulder. Climb up to a tree DCL and\nrappel 40ft into a huge cave-like space underneath the boulder. This is\na neat chamber with a hidden waterfall. To exit: crawl through a narrow\n4ft tall gap underneath a second suspended chockstone (this one the size\nof a small car). Be aware: this gap may be blocked by wood and debris.\nIt may be prudent to send a scout down to investigate (prepared to\nascend back out) and make sure the way is clear. In 2023, the exit was\ncompletely blocked, but we were able to knock out enough debris to\nsqueeze through. (In high water or if the exit is blocked, scramble\nfurther up the slope DCL and use a different tree to rappel back in\ndownstream of the second chockstone.)</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>10ft low-angle slide DCR. In low water conditions, it will be dry\nand can be downclimbed carefully.</li>\n<li><strong>R7</strong> 35ft from single bolt. Upon arriving at the top\nof the pitch, the creek diverts around both sides of yet another large\nboulder. Downclimb around the DCL side to find the bolt creek-center on\nthe downstream side of the boulder, making a nice line down the drop.\nThe rappel drops into a mini chest-deep pothole, then clamber out to\nrappel the rest of the way down. Swim out through a short water-filled\nnarrows.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>Below the final rappel, the canyon abruptly opens out. There's a nice\nplace DCL to de-wetsuit.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>On the DCL/north side of the creek, a very nice, well-maintained\ntrail heads off downstream. <font color=\"red\"><em>Do not go this\ndirection!</em></font> The path leads quickly onto private property.\nPlans are currently afoot to contact the local land owner regarding\naccess. This page will be updated when new information becomes\navailable. (With a good exit and car shuttle, Lower Fulton would be\namazing.)</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Instead, exit the creek abruptly DCL, and make your way directly\nnorth, bushwhacking up a ridge. The distance and elevation gain back to\nthe road is relatively trivial, but it is steep and unrelenting. Follow\nthe path of least resistance, keeping to a northerly course to stay on\ntimber company land. Near the rim, thicker vegetation takes over\n(reminiscent of English hedgerows) and you may find yourself wallowing\nor tunneling armadillo-like through the brush making excessive grunting\nnoises. Keep going and eventually prevail as you break out onto an\novergrown logging grade near the rim. Follow this climber's left a few\nhundred feet, then bushwhack over to the road. So far we have not\nidentified anything resembling a \"good\" route. Just keep going, take\nbreaks as needed, and, eventually, you will prevail. The total elevation\ngain is about 500ft. Upon intersecting Fulton Creek Road, turn left and\nwalk back to your waiting vehicle (~2min). Declare victory.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<p>Be aware: Lower Fulton is on private timber company land. Access\ncould be rescinded at any time, so please treat the area with respect\nand practice your best Leave No Trace.</p>\n<p>Please stay on timber company land and do not follow the trail\ndownstream upon exiting the canyon.</p>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n<p>Lower Fulton was first descended in Sept 2022 by Kevin Clark,\nHereward Cooper, and Alex Danielson. We ran both Upper and Lower Fulton,\nexiting just before sunset.</p>\n<p>In 2023, a second descent team: Kevin Clark, Clint Clow, Emily\nMcEntire, Trey Schutrumpf, and Eric Rutz finished exploring the bottom\nof the creek and discovered the exit trail.</p>\n",
