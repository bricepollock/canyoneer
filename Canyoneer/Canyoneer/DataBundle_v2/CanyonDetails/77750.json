The first abseil, which may be avoidable on the left, dropped us into a large amphitheater. A bit of a scramble down the creek and then the canyon starts with an abseil down a narrow slot. The canyon got increasingly dark to the point where you couldn't see much at all. Julie got her light out to get down the next scramble. The rest of us then trusting Julie's instructions on how to negotiate the rocks with the aid of a rope.The next two abseils had very awkward starts with the anchor below you. Then came the squeeze. This was definitely the tightest bit of canyoning I'd done. We estimate it took me about half an hour to go about 8 metres. It's apparently wider near the bottom so I spent most of that half hour on my left side in cold muddy water about 10cm deep trying to inch my way forward. Meanwhile everyone else was busy taking photos and cracking jokes (I was laughing along with them).<\/i>\"<\/li><\/ul>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Background\">Background<\/h2><\/div>\n\n\n<\/div>","quality":0,"version":"3917435045bd4cd9dff2f98f5797e2c589ffb1910783ae17fc51e673047795b3","timeRating":null,"waterRating":null,"riskRating":null,"permit":"No","months":["Oct","Nov","Dec","Jan","Feb","Mar","Apr"],"geojson":null,"name":"Caveman","technicalRating":null,"rappelCountMin":null,"rappelLongestMeters":null,"vehicle":null,"id":77750,"shuttleSeconds":null,"rappelCountMax":null,"url":"https:\/\/ropewiki.com\/Caveman","latitude":-32.9612}
