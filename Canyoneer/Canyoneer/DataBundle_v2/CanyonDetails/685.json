  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>A few notes on the technical descent:</p>\n<p>1. It is very easy to get your rope stuck on the 160 foot rappel\n(last of the upper section before the big drop) if both sides are in the\nline of rappel. Place the pull side around a small corner of rock on the\nleft to keep it free from the rappel side and keep them from interfering\nwith each other.</p>\n<p>2. We were not able to locate the ledge 60 feet above the canyon\nfloor that Todd Martin mentions in the route description. There is a\nsmall, but flat outcrop about 25 feet canyon right of the line of rappel\nthat I suspect may be the spot for this second anchor, but there is also\na good two bolt anchor directly in the watercourse that is about 30-40\nfeet above the canyon floor. This makes the rappel 410 feet to this\nsecond stage anchor.</p>\n<p>3. If descending the wet narrows after the big rappel, there are 4\nrappels up to around 50 feet to negotiate along the way and BY FAR the\nbest scenery in the canyon with waterfalls and lush, riparian Redwall\nnarrows. A few waist deep pools and one swimmer were encountered on our\nvisit.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><img src=\"book.png\" title=\"book.png\" alt=\"book.png\" /><a\nhref=\"http://ropewiki.com/User:Grand_Canyoneering_Book?id=Saddle_Canyon_(River_Mile_47)\">Grand\nCanyoneering Book by Todd Martin</a> : Saddle Canyon (River Mile\n47)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n",
