It is very easy to get your rope stuck on the 160 foot rappel (last of the upper section before the big drop) if both sides are in the line of rappel.  Place the pull side around a small corner of rock on the left to keep it free from the rappel side and keep them from interfering with each other.\n<\/p><p>2.  We were not able to locate the ledge 60 feet above the canyon floor that Todd Martin mentions in the route description.  There is a small, but flat outcrop about 25 feet canyon right of the line of rappel that I suspect may be the spot for this second anchor, but there is also a good two bolt anchor directly in the watercourse that is about 30-40 feet above the canyon floor.  This makes the rappel 410 feet to this second stage anchor.\n<\/p><p><br \/>\n3.  If descending the wet narrows after the big rappel, there are 4 rappels up to around 50 feet to negotiate along the way and BY FAR the best scenery in the canyon with waterfalls and lush, riparian Redwall narrows.  A few waist deep pools and one swimmer were encountered on our visit.\n<\/p>\n<ul><li>as of 5\/18\/24, The bolts mentioned on note #2 have been sheared off. You will need at least 465' of rope to reach the canyon floor. There is a small ledge about 50-60 feet above canyon floor, down canyon left that leads to a tree. The ledge is about 1\/2 a shoe width wide and my group stayed on rope to get to the tree.<\/li><\/ul>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Red_tape\">Red tape<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Beta_sites\">Beta sites<\/h2><\/div>\n<ul><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http:\/\/ropewiki.com\/User:Grand_Canyoneering_Book?id=Saddle_Canyon_(River_Mile_47)\">Grand Canyoneering Book by Todd Martin<\/a> &#160;: Saddle Canyon (River Mile 47)<\/li><\/ul>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Background\">Background<\/h2><\/div>\n\n\n<\/div>","waterRating":"B","timeRating":"VI","rappelCountMin":12,"quality":3.6,"shuttleSeconds":null,"rappelLongestMeters":117.35,"latitude":36.3572,"version":"7a498eb2a37b07d962aa8ee20b2d4eef008cc2a9ce114294ab3b64b65735f418","vehicle":"High Clearance","longitude":-111.9152,"rappelCountMax":12,"geojson":null,"technicalRating":4,"name":"Saddle Canyon (East)"}
