Jolla Sea Caves","rappelCountMax":null,"shuttleSeconds":null,"description":"<div class=\"mw-content-ltr mw-parser-output\" lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><p>The La Jolla Sea Caves are a great adventure for beginners and experienced cavers alike. Some people access the caves in winter, during the \"super low tides\" of -3ft. But they are more fun explored in the summer, with full wetsuit and snorkel and be ready to swim from cave to cave and explore the full depth of the caves on foot. \n<\/p><p>Some local shops in La Jolla Shores lead kayaking and snorkeling trips that are in general NOT worth the price tag. You can rent a kayak and do your own tour, but they will forbid you from entering the caves with the kayak. You can solve that problem by leaving someone out with the kayaks and snorkeling in the caves, but this is usually just a hassle. In my experience the best way to explore the La Jolla Sea caves is by snorkeling them on your own.\n<\/p><p>The San Diego Council of Divers lead annual snorkel tours of the La Jolla Caves as part of the RRR (Rock Rips and Reefs). These tours are open to anyone and completely free. They take people inside the caves and show them all the good stuff while telling rescue stories along the way. The best guides are usually the fearless young guy in a red shirt (Mike) and the wise old guy with webbed gloves that usually does the initial speech. <b>More information for upcoming 'La Jolla Caves' tours can be found at <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external free\" href=\"http:\/\/www.sddivers.com\/3rs.html\">http:\/\/www.sddivers.com\/3rs.html<\/a><\/b>\n<\/p><p>In wet conditions, it is imperative to check the swell and wave height before going to the caves. If the waves are 1ft or lower, you will be able to explore all the caves and will have a wonderful time. If the waves are 3ft or above you will not be able to access most caves and will most likely crash against the rocks ending with a lot of infected cuts.

It is not uncommon to find baby seals at the back of the cave, which is surprisingly extensive. After that, swim your way back to Sunny Jim Cave, often visited by tourists coming down from the Curio Shop. A small side passage (usually flooded in high tide) takes to a hidden altar room with candles and graffiti. From Sunny Jim get back in the water and proceed along the coast visiting the caves you deem fit. In some you will swim, in some you will walk, and in some you will do both. White Lady is the last of the caves.\n<\/p>\n<style data-mw-deduplicate=\"TemplateStyles:r1062633282\">@media all and (max-width:720px){.mw-parser-output .content .thumb>div:not(.thumbinner){display:flex;justify-content:center;flex-wrap:wrap;align-content:flex-start;flex-direction:column}}body.skin-vector .mw-parser-output div.thumb>div:not(.thumbinner){font-size:94%;text-align:center;overflow:hidden;min-width:100px}body.skin-minerva .mw-parser-output div.thumb>div:not(.thumbinner){margin:0 auto;max-width:100%!important}<\/style> \n<div class=\"thumb tright\">\n<div style=\"display:table;\">\n<span class=\"mw-default-size\" typeof=\"mw:Error mw:File\/Frameless\">\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>From White Lady's beach there are usually static ropes that allow climbing up the slippery slope (called \"The Devil's Slide\") to a small wooden bridge intersecting a coastal trail that will take you back to the Curio Shop. \n<\/p><p>If you have time, it is highly recommended to visit the nearby La Jolla Shores to snorkel with the Leopard Sharks, which are big and impressive, but harmless. You may swim there from White Lady's beach or drive to the vicinity of the Marine Room Restaurant and access the beach there. If the waves are big, visibility will be crappy.
