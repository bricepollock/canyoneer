class=\"mw-content-ltr mw-parser-output\" lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><p>Duncan is probably the number one best creek in the Portland area for training and practice. It sports everything found in aquatic canyons elsewhere, but on a smaller scale, with several sections of narrows and an unusual number of deep pools. There are plenty of short drops for practicing rigging, downclimbs, and a few spots that lend themselves to short jumps or slides. It has a little of everything. The lower part of Duncan Creek is popular with (non-canyoneering) locals and can be busy on hot midsummer days when people come to play in the pools.\n<\/p><p>Duncan runs high in the early season (and is great fun if you enjoy the swiftwater), but somewhere in May or June the water level drops and becomes beginner-friendly. A good way to estimate flow is to visit the checkpoint (R10) and see how much water, if any, is flowing down the Moss Chasm. If you see more than a trickle, Duncan is running high. \n<\/p>\n<ul><li>Given Duncan's popularity with hikers and families, please do not leave fixed anchors in the lower canyon.<\/li>\n<li>Catchment: 1.8mi^2.<\/li><\/ul>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Best_Practices\">Best Practices<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Duncan has been seeing increased visitation by canyoneers and is showing signs of abuse.  Please use anchors in or adjacent to the watercourse.  Climbing to trees higher up on the sides is attractive, but risks eroding the banks and trampling vegetation.\n<\/p>\n<ul><li>Teaching people to rappel for the first time in an aquatic canyon is not a good plan.  It's safer to become fully proficient in a dry location outside the canyon.<\/li><\/ul>\n<ul><li>Wrapping the rope around trees for a two strand rappel is efficient, but is not good for the tree when you go to pull your rope.  Friction damage around the back of the tree cuts into the bark.  Done too many times by too many people and the tree will become girdled and eventually die.  It's kinder to the tree to set an anchor or use a retrievable system.<\/li><\/ul>\n<ul><li>Two strand rappelling (as is done in alpine climbing) can be dangerous in aquatic canyons.  Excess rope present at the bottom of the pitch can become an entanglement hazard in deep pools.  Taking a class in aquatic canyoning techniques is strongly recommended.<\/li><\/ul>\n<ul><li>Beginners \"leading\" beginners is a major cause of accidents in canyoneering.<\/li><\/ul>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Parking\">Parking<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Park at the end of Duncan Creek Road at a large turnaround under the powerlines.

One of the best approaches is to walk up the road to the Nellie Corser trailhead and follow the obvious trail west. Eventually, you'll reach an easy-to-miss junction high above the creek; go right.  The trail eventually drops down to meet the creek and appears to end.  Cross the creek and pick it up again on the far side.  The trail you want heads off north on the west side of the creek.  Go upstream about 0.25mi and drop into the creek just above Quad Falls (~1500ft elevation).\n<\/p>\n<ul><li>The best checkpoint is to walk up to R10 from the parking area.

This is a fun downclimb when there's some water in the chute. This is the narrowest spot on Duncan.<\/li><\/ul>\n<ul><li>Low water:  <b>R10<\/b> - rappel 25ft DCL. This is a two-stage rappel. <font color=\"red\">There is potential for foot entrapment in a V-shaped groove on the first tier.<\/font> For safety, it may be good to position someone in the mid-tier pothole (not that deep) to assist. Both of the tiers on this rappel are awkward and it takes skill to rappel them gracefully. We usually send someone back to the top to remove the anchor after everyone has rappelled.<\/li><\/ul>\n<ul><li>Bypass: both these options can be skipped by hiking down a trail that runs down the middle of the island to the bottom.<\/li><\/ul>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Update July 2022: Below the last rappel, exit the creek immediately DCL to a user trail.
