  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>A beautiful short canyon that empties into Detroit Lake. It has\nseveral nice drops, some interesting geological features, and the\nentertaining novelty (if no boat) of swimming out through the lake. The\ncanyon usually sees lower flow and may be \"open for business\" earlier in\nthe season than others in the area. Plan your exit strategy before\ncommitting, however. You'll need a boat, pack-raft, or prepare for a\nlong swim. Best done on a calm day.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The checkpoint for flow is where the paved road crosses Heater\nCreek.</li>\n<li>Watershed: 2.42mi^2.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"directions\">Directions</h2>\n<p>Cross the Detroit Dam at the west end of the lake and continue on the\npaved road as it circles around the lake. At about 5mi, the road enters\nan old clearcut and the canyon can be seen on the left. At 5.5mi the\ncanyon crosses the creek. There's a campsite here and this is a good\nplace to check the flow. Immediately past the bridge, turn left on an\nold logging road (high clearance may be a good idea, although it could\nbe driven carefully with a 2WD passenger vehicle) and drive down about\n0.5mi to the first junction. Turn right here into a campsite; this is a\ngood place to park. If occupied, there are a couple of other pullouts\nfurther down the road (including one wacky hunter's shelter in\n2022).</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>The original beta described a descent of the creek from the\naforementioned bridge. Other parties have gone this way and describe\nseveral hours of bushwhacking through thick vegetation. Just say \"no.\" A\nbetter approach is to backtrack up the logging road from the parking\narea to the edge of the clear cut (5min walk) and make your way down\nsteep slopes into the canyon below. Pick your descent with care and\nbeware knocking rocks down on one another. It may be better/safer to do\na quick dirty rappel to get down into the creek. Head downstream about\nfive minutes to the top of R1.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>All rappels can be done out of the water in high flow.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>R1: 60ft from tree DCL. Beware foot entrapment hazard near the\nbottom. (Future parties might consider moving the anchor. The DCR side\nof the falls may be a safer line.) High water: rappel from a tree DCR -\nand chain with R2 below.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>R2: 35ft from log creek center. Drop down behind a rootball and\nclimb out underneath.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Downclimb 20ft DCR.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>R3: 20ft from tree DCR.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>R4: 120ft from tree DCL. You will be in the flow; upper section\ncould be dangerous in high water.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Walk down the bedrock to the lakeshore. In summer, watch for\namphibians in the lake and around the final falls.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>A short distance downstream from the final rappel, Heater Creek\nempties into Detroit Lake. There are three options to exit the canyon\nfrom here. For options (1) and (2), beware summer boat traffic. Boats\nsometimes come hurtling down the inlet at high speeds and may not be\nexpecting swimmers or pack-rafters. Best to stick close to shore on one\nside or the other. Also check the weather: exiting the canyon may be\nmuch more difficult on windy or stormy days.</p>\n<p>1. Swim down the inlet along the DCR (north) shore until you find a\nplace where you feel comfortable climbing out and bushwhacking back up\nto the logging road atop the ridge. Once on the road, turn right and\nhike back up the road to find your car. If you choose this option, be\nsure you have your flotation dialed. (A PFD might be appropriate for\nweaker swimmers.) You may have to swim as much as 0.25mi. The further\nout toward the main lake you go, the easier it gets to climb out. You\nmay have to bushwhack/scramble up 200-400ft. Addendum: there are plenty\nof rock ledges along the lakeshore with some great places to practice\njumping into the lake.</p>\n<p>2. The second option is to bring a pack raft and paddle out the inlet\nuntil you find a place to climb out as described above. Alternatively,\npaddle west and south about 1.5mi to the bridge on the southwest arm of\nthe lake where you can exit. Obviously, this would require a car\nshuttle.</p>\n<p>3. The third option is to arrange for someone to pick you up by\nboat.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<p>None.</p>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><img src=\"rwl_en.png\" title=\"rwl_en.png\" alt=\"rwl_en.png\" /><a\nhref=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20210527212206/www.canyoneeringnorthwest.com/HeaterCreek/Heater_Creek.php\">CanyoneeringNorthwest.com\n(archive.org)</a> : Heater Creek</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n<p>It's likely that the first descent of Heater Creek was Matt Moore of\nDesert Highlights &amp; Cascade Canyoneering.
