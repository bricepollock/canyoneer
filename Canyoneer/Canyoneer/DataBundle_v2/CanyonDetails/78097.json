From here one may climb along a semi-submerged ledge to the right\nof the pool or swim to the mouth of the slot. A bit of rock climbing is\ncalled for in traversing right, across the cliff face at the head of the\nchasm to a scree-filled gu1ly which runs down to the top of the 180 foot\nfall.</em></p>\n<p><em>One may easily scramble around the last fall to the right or\nleft, however, a belay to the tree on the right of the falls offers an\nirresistible 240 foot abseil.</em></p>\n<p><em>Two ropes are sufficient for a single strand descent, but four\nropes (doubling up) are recommended.</em></p>\n<p><em>The best route out of the chasm lies up an obvious gully to the\nright (west).</em></p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><img src=\"rwl_en.png\" title=\"rwl_en.png\" alt=\"rwl_en.png\" /><a\nhref=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20180816031233/http://members.ozemail.com.au/~dnoble/Bushwalking/ColongBindook/ColongBindook.html\">David\nNoble</a> : Colong Caves and Bindook Chasm - 1975</li>\n<li><img src=\"rwl_en.png\" title=\"rwl_en.png\" alt=\"rwl_en.png\" /><a\nhref=\"https://youtu.be/cbRxV3HNEO4\">YouTube.com</a> : Richard Pattison,\nBindook Chasm movie</li>\n</ul>\n<p>{{#ev:youtube|cbRxV3HNEO4}}</p>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n",
