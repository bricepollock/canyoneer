From here one may climb along a semi-submerged ledge to the right of the pool or swim to the mouth of the slot. A bit of rock climbing is called for in traversing right, across the cliff face at the head of the chasm to a scree-filled gu1ly which runs down to the top of the 180 foot fall. <\/i>\n<\/p><p><i>One may easily scramble around the last fall to the right or left, however, a belay to the tree on the right of the falls offers an irresistible 240 foot abseil.<\/i>\n<\/p><p><i>Two ropes are sufficient for a single strand descent, but four ropes (doubling up) are recommended.<\/i>\n<\/p><p><i>The best route out of the chasm lies up an obvious gully to the right (west).<\/i>\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Red_tape\">Red tape<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Beta_sites\">Beta sites<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media<\/h2><\/div>\n<ul><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20180816031233\/http:\/\/members.ozemail.com.au\/~dnoble\/Bushwalking\/ColongBindook\/ColongBindook.html\">David Noble<\/a>&#160;: Colong Caves and Bindook Chasm - 1975<\/li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/cbRxV3HNEO4\">YouTube.com<\/a>&#160;: Richard Pattison, Bindook Chasm movie<\/li><\/ul>\n<p><br \/>\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Background\">Background<\/h2><\/div>\n\n\n<\/div>","quality":0,"timeRating":null}
