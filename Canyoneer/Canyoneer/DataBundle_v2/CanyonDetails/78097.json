From here one may climb along a semi-submerged ledge to the right of the pool or swim to the mouth of the slot. A bit of rock climbing is called for in traversing right, across the cliff face at the head of the chasm to a scree-filled gu1ly which runs down to the top of the 180 foot fall. <\/i>\n<\/p><p><i>One may easily scramble around the last fall to the right or left, however, a belay to the tree on the right of the falls offers an irresistible 240 foot abseil.<\/i>\n<\/p><p><i>Two ropes are sufficient for a single strand descent, but four ropes (doubling up) are recommended.<\/i>\n<\/p><p><i>The best route out of the chasm lies up an obvious gully to the right (west).<\/i>\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Red_tape\">Red tape<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Beta_sites\">Beta sites<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media<\/h2><\/div>\n<ul><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20180816031233\/http:\/\/members.ozemail.com.au\/~dnoble\/Bushwalking\/ColongBindook\/ColongBindook.html\">David Noble<\/a>&#160;: Colong Caves and Bindook Chasm - 1975<\/li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/cbRxV3HNEO4\">YouTube.com<\/a>&#160;: Richard Pattison, Bindook Chasm movie<\/li><\/ul>\n<p><br \/>\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Background\">Background<\/h2><\/div>\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nParsed by mw‐api‐ext.codfw.canary‐cb4999499‐m2zz2\nCached time: 20240914192130\nCache expiry: 2592000\nReduced expiry: false\nComplications: [show‐toc]\nCPU time usage: 0.006 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.007 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 21\/1000000\nPost‐expand include size: 0\/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 0\/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 2\/100\nExpensive parser function count: 0\/500\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0\/20\nUnstrip post‐expand size: 0\/5000000 bytes\nNumber of Wikibase entities loaded: 0\/400\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%    0.000      1 -total\n-->\n<\/div>","rappelCountMax":null,"quality":0,"vehicle":null,"name":"Bindook Chasm","shuttleSeconds":null,"rappelLongestMeters":null,"url":"https:\/\/ropewiki.com\/Bindook_Chasm","permit":"No","riskRating":null}
