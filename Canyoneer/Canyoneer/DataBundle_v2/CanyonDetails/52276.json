  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>A short canyon off Highway 4. It's not particularly gorged in, and\nmost of the drops are low angle, and blocky, allowing for easy\ndownclimbs. The scenery is nice though, and it's a short trip, perhaps a\ndecent place to introduce someone to canyons? Based of the gauge (which\ndoes not live update) it seems that this creek is maintained at around\n1.5cfs pretty consistently.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>Take Hunter Dam Road 1.6 miles off Hwy 4 and find somewhere to park.\nThis should put you just a little ways past a house and some private\nproperty. A short bushwhack down the hill will take you to Mill Creek,\nand you can start down. At times the foliage may include a considerable\nnumber of berry bushes with very sharp thorns, so clothing with good\ncoverage is very helpful.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>The canyon starts with a beautiful riverwalk interspersed with a few\n(perhaps four?) downclimbs. A bit of team climbing is helpful on the\nlater downclimbs.</p>\n<p>About three quarters of the way down the canyon (per the GPS track),\nthe rappels begin. Some of them are pretty fun, none require any real\nswiftwater technique at the standard flow of 1.5cfs.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>R1: 30'. 2 options: LDC by wrapping a boulder with a crack is\ntotally dry; RDC off a small tree (depending on the line you take you\ncan choose to go in or out of the flow here). The in-flow option has\nsome sharp edges, so creeping the rope is a good idea.</li>\n<li>R2: 100' almost exactly off a boulder LDC, following the split in\nthe waterfall to the left (natural fall line). There may be an option to\nrig a tree at the top, center canyon, and to descend in the waterfalls\nand get a little wet. This will likely require more than 100' of rope.\nThe slope of the rappel might make it possible to stop early and\ndownclimb.</li>\n<li>R 2.5 or Downclimb: 30'. Just after R2 there's a crack RDC.\nExperienced canyoneers will have no problem downclimbing, but beginners\nmay prefer to rappel this. It's possible to exit the canyon at this\npoint by scrambling up the hill DCL.</li>\n<li>R3: 30' - The third rappel is short down from the top of a small\nwaterfall. A tree at the lip of the waterfall provides a good anchor,\nand options to rappel left through a bit of water or right onto dry\nrocks.</li>\n<li>R4: 50-120'. The fourth rappel is at a fairly vertical waterfall LDC\nthat pauses at a small pool (50') before continuing down a gentler slope\nto collect in a large pool (an additional 70'). It's possible to\ndownclimb the 2nd part, but some of the rocks are extremely slippery, so\na rappel may be prudent for beginners. A tree on the RDC of the\nwaterfall makes for a good anchor, though there are many other\noptions.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Perhaps the highlight of the canyon is a sharp right turn into a\nlittle gorge. Just after that section, you can see the canyon get choked\nwith bushes. This is where we chose to exit.</p>\n<p>The slope of the canyon mellows here, but it does drop another 600ft\nof elevation to the river, with some waterfalls easily seen on satellite\nimagery. You could choose to continue, but then you'll need to discover\nyour own way out.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>Make your way up the ridge, keeping an eye out for poison oak, which\nshould be avoidable if you are careful. The way is steep, with\noccasional exposure and loose rock. Eventually, you will get to a small\ncliff blocking the ridge, which can be bypassed on the right. Continue\nback up to the left, and soon after that cliff, you'll come out to the\nroad, and a short walk back up it to your car.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<p>Note that there is private property that extends close to the drop-in\npoint. Signs are posted on the trees. As long as you are close to the\nend of the trees you should be fine. The rest of the canyon is solidly\nin USFS land.</p>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<p>We did this canyon with a team of three (including two first-timers)\nin July 2018. We used a 200-foot rope, and added a short pull-cord as\ninsurance on the 100-foot rappel. Water noise and blind corners made it\ndifficult to communicate down some of the rappels, which added a little\ncomplexity for those learning to rappel, but everything went fine. The\ncanyon was absolutely beautiful, with steady running but unproblematic\nwater flow. The water was very warm (swimming pool temperature), and\nalmost entirely avoidable for those who wanted to stay dry. We did end\nup spending substantially longer, car to car, than the ~5 hours\npredicted, and were glad to have started early in the day so that we\nstill had plenty of sunlight for our exit.</p>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n",
