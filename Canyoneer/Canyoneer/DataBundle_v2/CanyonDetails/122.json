The exit point is usually well-marked with a cairn at the canyon bottom, but canyoneers should study this location on maps beforehand because it is easy to miss without the cairn.  The scramble up the ridge is approximately 150 ft of elevation gain, and then there is an additional 80 ft of elevation gain back to the Mount Wilson Trail.\n<\/p><p>This exit is steep, eroded, and often covered in poison oak.  The Dam exit is preferable.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading3\"><h3 id=\"Dam\">Dam<\/h3><\/div>\n<p><b>As you exit through the dam area, please uproot any <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https:\/\/www.cal-ipc.org\/plants\/profile\/ricinus-communis-profile\/\">castor bean plants<\/a> you see. They're invasive and awful in every way<\/b>. N.B. EXTREME CARE is REQUIRED. Wear gloves, don't let them touch you, they can cause severe dermatitis. Do NOT munch on seeds, that's where ricin poison comes from. There are some large plants up behind the hillside stabilization that need uprooting at some point. We will likely have to diligently do this for a decade to prevent their infesting the canyon. \n<\/p><p>Most parties continue their descent below the Ridge Exit and complete three additional rappels. The last rappel now has two bolts LDC that replace the two bolts RDC that were of questionable quality. It is also down climbable with the right conditions and skill set.\n<\/p><p>After the last of these rappels, there is a short walk to the debris basin of the dam protecting the end of LSA. <b>Note that by taking this exit you will be trespassing<\/b>. To bypass the dam, follow the road RDC over the dam, and then exit through the gate. This gate is often locked, necessitating climbing over it on the RDC side.  From this point, take the middle of three streets (Idlehour Lane) down hill. Continue down hill until you reach the intersection of Mira Monte and Mountain Trail.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Red_tape\">Red tape<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>The normal exit is technically trespassing through the LADWP \/ Amry Corps of Engineers property, but the workers that occasionally are there never seem to mind Canyoneers exiting that way.  You will have to climb over the steel bar fence (it's easy enough on the right wall next to the gate).  At least after the major via-duct construction, the fence no longer has sharp \"spears\" on top. It is now flat square bar steel.\n<\/p><p>Parking enforcement does ticket \n<\/p>\n\n\n<\/div><div class=\"mw-content-ltr mw-parser-output\" lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><p>for not \"curbing\" your wheels in Sierra Madre. Be sure to turn your wheels toward the curb (in for downhill facing, out for uphill facing) at the trailhead to avoid a $40 ticket.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Beta_sites\">Beta sites<\/h2><\/div>\n<ul><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http:\/\/brennen.caltech.edu\/advents\/lanita.htm\">Chris Brennen's Adventure Hikes (San Gabriels)<\/a> &#160;: Little Santa Anita Canyon<\/li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https:\/\/www.stavislost.com\/hikes\/trail\/little-santa-anita-canyon\">Stav is Lost - April 28, 2023<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http:\/\/theatsteam.com\/adventureworks\/little-santa-anita-canyon.html\">ATS<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http:\/\/www.ucanyon.com\/canyon-beta\/southern-california\/san-gabriel-valley-front-range\/little-santa-anita-canyon-%E2%80%93-3b-ii\">uCanyon<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http:\/\/ropewiki.com\/User:Super_Amazing_Map?id=Little_Santa_Anita_Canyon_-_California_(San_Gabriels)\">Super Amazing Map<\/a> &#160;: Little Santa Anita Canyon<\/li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http:\/\/canyonchronicles.com\/little-santa-anita-canyon?kmlidx=205701186783545362755.0004e47e7e6d0bfdece9d\">CanyonChronicles.com<\/a> &#160;: Little Santa Anita Canyon<\/li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http:\/\/summitpost.org\/little-santa-anita-canyon\/313223\">SummitPost.org<\/a> &#160;: Little Santa Anita Canyon<\/li><\/ul>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media<\/h2><\/div>\n<ul><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http:\/\/candition.com\/canyons\/little-santa-anita-lsa\">Candition.com<\/a> &#160;: Little Santa Anita (LSA)<\/li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https:\/\/www.duffyknox.com\/Content\/n-f5S3bd\/photography\/sports\/Canyoneering\/Canyoneering-Little-Santa\/\">Little Santa Anita after dark<\/a><\/li><\/ul>\n<p><br \/>\n<\/p><p>Like all canyons, character can vary with conditions.
