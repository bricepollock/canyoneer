While someone looking for a committing canyoneering route would be intensely disappointed with Rush Creek, another person looking for interesting waterfalls and exciting (potentially challenging) rappels with late season flow would be quite pleased.  Most of the rappels (with the possible exception of Horsetail Falls) can be easily walked around without straying too far from the watercourse, so this could be a good place to practice Class C skills without risking the commitment of some of the West side canyons.  Apparently this is an ice climbing spot in the winter, and has some bolted anchors from the climbers.  \n<\/p><p>Note that while only a 230 foot rope is required for Horsetail Falls, a 300 foot rope would give you an option for a better rappel.\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>There is roadside parking available where Rush Creek goes under the June Lake Loop road.  From here you can walk, or drive a second vehicle 1 mile north to the Rush Creek Trail trailhead.  The Rush Creek Trail cuts south climbing up just over 1200 feet of elevation to a gauging station where a sign suggests that \"Sportsman\" should be careful or something like that.  This is a good spot to suit up and get in.  \n<\/p><p>Note that you can (and people do) walk up the tramway that runs straight up the mountain from near where you park.  While it is a more unique and efficient approach, this activity is strongly discouraged by SCE (as signs where the trail crosses indicate).  But, locals definitely do it, and the tram does not seem to see much use.  This particular ascent has been described as \"the stairmaster from hell\".\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>A first drop into a cool gorge starts off right away.  We chose to rappel from a large old anchor embedded in the down canyon left side of the falls some 30 feet or so downcanyon, which makes for a fun, ~60 foot free hanging drop into a waist deep pool.  Another smaller waterfall follows just around the bend, and makes for an exciting rappel or can be downclimbed on the left.  \n<\/p><p>The scenic watercourse that follows from here could have some less exciting rappels or could be bypassed easily on the right to get to the top of Horsetail Falls.  \n<\/p><p>When you get to the top of Horsetail Falls you will find a set of two rusty old button bolts.  I wouldn't recommend rappelling straight off of these without backing them up, but a rappel (a 300 foot rope would be sufficient) straight down off of them would take you through the watercourse for the most exciting rappel.  Alternatively, 80 feet down to your right on a ledge are some fairly bomber looking bolts with a chain anchor that could be rappelled or likely downclimbed to.  A 230 foot rappel off these will bring you to the bottom.  \n<\/p><p>Water from the falls enters a crack and drives sharply left, off another falls.  The crack can be bypassed to get to the top of the waterfall.  The left side of this waterfall constricts all of the water into one place, which you will be directly in.  If flows are anything but low, you should probably stay right, or bypass this rappel entirely.  If flows are low, it is quite a bit of fun.  \n<\/p><p>A bouldery easily downclimbable section follows as the creek bends right.  After it turns left and drops down toward the valley again, what I would consider to be the highlight of the canyon follows.  Rush Creek drops sharply into an angled slot and disappears down below.  We rappeled off a rock chock backed up with a knot chock off of right side of this slot, and down off the overhang into it.  The pull wasn't great, but worked alright.  At the exit of this slot is an ~8 foot drop that we were able to downclimb with low flows, but could prove problematic with high water, especially given a lack of anchor options in the slot.  \n<\/p><p>More easily downclimbable sections follow, though the canyon does get steep where the waterflow twists around a sort of rock fin sticking up, where one might find a spot to rappel.  Downstream from this is the final rappel of ~100 feet and can be descended off of a set of bolts which can be found by downclimbing boulders to the edge of the drop.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Hike downstream, exit out at the bridge, and find a short path on the left side of Rush Creek that will bring you back to your car.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Red_tape\">Red tape<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>There is a no trespassing sign next to the SCE plant where you come out, that faces away from you as you exit the canyon, which seems to indicate that maybe you shouldn't be there (though you would probably never actually notice it on your exit).  It seems unlikely that any SCE people would be particularly offended by you passing through on your way out, though I suppose I could be wrong.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Beta_sites\">Beta sites<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media<\/h2><\/div>\n<ul><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external free\" href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/scott.swaney\/media_set?set=a.10154494959112930&amp;type=3&amp;pnref=story\">https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/scott.swaney\/media_set?set=a.10154494959112930&amp;type=3&amp;pnref=story<\/a><\/li><\/ul>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Background\">Background<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Identified by Rick Inniello, and joined in on the exploration\n<\/p>\n\n\n<\/div><div class=\"mw-content-ltr mw-parser-output\" lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><pre>by Scott Swaney, Daniel Elson &amp; Herve Mazoyer on 9-11-16.
