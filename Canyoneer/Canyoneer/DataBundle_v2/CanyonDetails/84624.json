The last rappel takes you to a beautiful wet grotto once you rappel past a hanging boulder above you.\nThe Black Canyons area allows no bolting.  All rappels have boulder\/rock features which make bomber anchors.\nThe loop part of my track: south is technical descend, north is exit.\nIf you wish to make it a full day, can head north and ascend back up (following my track) till you get to the split of lollipop and drop into Weeping Springs and hit that canyon too.\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>The first part of the approach is similar to the approach for Weeping Springs, which is mostly class 1 and class 2.
