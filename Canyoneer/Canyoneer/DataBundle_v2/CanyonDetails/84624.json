The last rappel takes you to a beautiful wet grotto once you rappel past a hanging boulder above you.\nThe Black Canyons area allows no bolting.  All rappels have boulder\/rock features which make bomber anchors.\nThe loop part of my track: south is technical descend, north is exit.\nIf you wish to make it a full day, can head north and ascend back up (following my track) till you get to the split of lollipop and drop into Weeping Springs and hit that canyon too.\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>The first part of the approach is similar to the approach for Weeping Springs, which is mostly class 1 and class 2.  Before hitting the 1st rappel for Weeping Springs, head southeast, then head east toward the river once it hits class 3 downclimbs.  The Colorado River comes in full view when you hit the 1st rappel anchor.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Rap 1: 60'\nRap 2: 50'\nRap 3: 75'\nRap 4: 100' (200' rope works fine for this rappel)\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>There are multiple ways to exit.  The traditional way is to head south (turn right at the last rappel) and go back up via Big Horn Canyon.\nInstead of exiting Big Horn, we head north (turn left at the last rappel) and took a class 2 route between this canyon and Weeping Springs.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Red_tape\">Red tape<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Beta_sites\">Beta sites<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Background\">Background<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Prior to making this page, we asked multiple canyon groups and seasoned canyoneerers if this canyon has a name, as the rope anchors were already there.
