  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p><font color=\"red\"><strong>Be aware: Nelson Creek is on private land.\nPlease see Red Tape before running this creek.</strong></font></p>\n<p>A nice short (few hours) objective -- possibly one that can be\ncombined with other outings in the area. Nelson Creek seems to sport\ngood flow early in the season, but reduces to a trickle in late August.\nExpect some swimming. Nelson culminates with a swim through a 300ft long\ntunnel.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>For a longer adventure, consider combining Nelson with <a\nhref=\"http://ropewiki.com/Souther_Creek\">Souther Creek</a> next\ndoor.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<h3 id=\"directions_lower_trailhead\">Directions: Lower Trailhead</h3>\n<p>From Bridge of the Gods, go east on Hwy 14. Follow Hwy 14 for 3.9mi,\npassing through the town of Stevenson to locate a large pullout on the\nright/south side of the road. It is the first pullout just past the\nStevenson Cemetary. The pullout is just across from \"Passage Way\" - a\nprivate drive.</p>\n<h3 id=\"directions_upper_trailhead\">Directions: Upper Trailhead</h3>\n<p>Either walk or shuttle to the upper trailhead. Use caution if walking\nalong Hwy 14 as cars come barreling along at high speeds. Follow Hwy 14\neast for 0.3mi, before turning left onto much quieter Nelson Creek Rd.\nFollow the winding road upwards for 0.5mi, keeping an eye out left for a\nguard-rail. One can either park in a pullout immediately before the\nguardrail or continue ahead 100ft to a much larger pullout across the\nstreet from a private residence. Total hike time: 15min.</p>\n<p>Please respect the locals and drop down into the creek before donning\nwetsuits.</p>\n<h3 id=\"dropping_in\">Dropping In</h3>\n<p>From the upper parking area, walk north up the road. On passing the\ndriveway to the private home on your right, watch carefully on the left\nside for a dirty trail disappearing downwards into the bushes. Keep a\nclose eye out as it's not immediately obvious. Follow the trail steeply\ndownwards and you'll drop right in on what looks like a makeshift water\ncollection station with a small working electric pump. The pump likely\nserves one of the local residences, so touch nothing.</p>\n<p>Walk downstream all of 2min to the top of R1.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>R1: <em>Nelson Falls</em> - 75ft. Rappel from large boulder DCL. In\nlow water, land on a ledge at the edge of the plunge-pool. Either drop\ninto the pool or edge DCL to avoid the swim. In higher water you may\nwant to use a tree higher up DCR to stay out of the flow.</li>\n<li>R2: 12ft. Rappel or carefully downclimb (?) DCR.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Below R2, stay DCL and scramble through house-sized boulders for\n200ft. Watch for a big tree DCL which marks a possible exit: a dirt\ntrail that switchbacks steeply upwards to the road. Beware poison oak\nalong the escape route.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>15ft ramp.</li>\n<li>30ft ramp.</li>\n<li>R3: 25ft into a pool.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Head downstream about 5-10min. It can be thrashy depending on the\nseason. Stay in the creek all the way to then end to find a giant\nculvert passing underneath Hwy 14 and the RR tracks. The tunnel is huge;\npeople have kayaked through it before when the river is high enough.\nWade or swim the tunnel out into the Columbia River - an amusing finale\nto Nelson Creek. Headlamp unnecessary during the daylight hours.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>Once through the tunnel bear west (DCR) along the shore a 100yrds and\nthen climb out on the rocks wherever is easiest. Make your way up a\nsteep bank, cross the RR tracks to your waiting car. While clearly\nfishermen frequent the shore here from time to time, be aware that\nwalking on the tracks is trespassing, so make the crossing short &amp;\nsweet. Freight trains come barreling through here at 60mph with\nlittle-to-no warning, so this is not a good place to linger or go for a\nwalk.</p>\n<h3 id=\"staging_area\">Staging Area</h3>\n<p>Changing out of wetsuits right along Hwy 14 is not recommended.\nInstead of giving the neighbors and passing drivers a show, head west on\nHwy 14 about 0.8mi to Stevenson. At the west end of town where the main\nroad diverges from the business route, turn off immediately left on an\nunsigned road toward Sailboard Park. The road become dirt briefly,\ncrosses a small creek, then goes under the RR tracks. Once under the\nbridge, look for a large pullout on your right and a pedestrian\nbridge/walkway on your left. Park here and walk in to a largely unsigned\nhidden picnic area which makes for a much better place to change. Nice\nviews of the river here and good place to relax and enjoy a post-canyon\nfestive beverage. Drive-time: ~2 minutes.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<p><strong>Update: Aug 28, 2017</strong><br />\nA group running the creek had an encounter with a local homeowner who\nindicated that Nelson Falls is actually on private land and that they\nprefer folks to check in with them before running the creek per\nliability concerns. Previously (per the <a\nhref=\"https://www.waterfallsnorthwest.com/waterfall/Nelson-Falls-4880\">NW\nWaterfall Survey</a>) it was believed that Nelson was on public land,\nbut after a closer examination of land parcels in <a\nhref=\"http://skamaniawa.mapsifter.com/defaultHTML5.aspx\">Skamania\nCounty</a> it appears Nelson is indeed private. It would be best to not\nrun this creek without first getting permission from the land owners.\n:(</p>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n<p>Several very old ropes were found at several of the lower falls\nindicating this creek has seen previous visitors. There was no sign of\nrecent visitation in visiting in July 2017.</p>\n",
