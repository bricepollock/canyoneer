The real name is Dead Tree canyon.\n<\/p><p>David Noble says: named after a dead tree in the middle of an abseil in the canyon. First done the day after the initial trip down Crikey Canyon by Bob Sault and Ian Wilson (SUBW). (VS&amp;M; No 2 - 1983) Bob Sault writes \"My recollection was that Ian and I were the first to do Dead Tree Canyon (perhaps it was the day after a trip down Crikey -- it was certainly on a Sunday after a day out canyoning in that part of the world). When I returned a number of years later, it was amazingly easier. There were several dead trees (still covered with leaves)choking the canyon the first time. The tree abseil was particularly unpleasant to fight your way through. Later that day, Ian just caught the last train from Bell, whereas I just missed it.\" Ian Wilson adds \"The info on Dead Tree is correct - Doug dropped us off at the end of Pot Hill (Waratah Ridge) Rd after we had done Surefire I think.\"\n<\/p>\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nParsed by mw‐api‐ext.codfw.main‐6779cc57fc‐2dzbc\nCached time: 20240914191843\nCache expiry: 2592000\nReduced expiry: false\nComplications: [show‐toc]\nCPU time usage: 0.005 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.006 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 21\/1000000\nPost‐expand include size: 0\/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 0\/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 2\/100\nExpensive parser function count: 0\/500\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0\/20\nUnstrip post‐expand size: 0\/5000000 bytes\nNumber of Wikibase entities loaded: 0\/400\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%    0.000      1 -total\n-->\n<\/div>","timeRating":null,"geojson":null,"name":"Dead Log","id":77652,"permit":"No","rappelCountMax":null,"latitude":-33.4011,"riskRating":null,"vehicle":null,"technicalRating":null,"quality":0,"version":"e12ffc71fb186a67202dbf16516657746a14b6597b7f72687f098afe1e9abc9f","waterRating":null,"url":"https:\/\/ropewiki.com\/Dead_Log"}
