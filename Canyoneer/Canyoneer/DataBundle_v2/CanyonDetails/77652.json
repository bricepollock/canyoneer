The real name is Dead Tree canyon.\n<\/p><p>David Noble says: named after a dead tree in the middle of an abseil in the canyon. First done the day after the initial trip down Crikey Canyon by Bob Sault and Ian Wilson (SUBW). (VS&amp;M; No 2 - 1983) Bob Sault writes \"My recollection was that Ian and I were the first to do Dead Tree Canyon (perhaps it was the day after a trip down Crikey -- it was certainly on a Sunday after a day out canyoning in that part of the world). When I returned a number of years later, it was amazingly easier. There were several dead trees (still covered with leaves)choking the canyon the first time. The tree abseil was particularly unpleasant to fight your way through. Later that day, Ian just caught the last train from Bell, whereas I just missed it.\" Ian Wilson adds \"The info on Dead Tree is correct - Doug dropped us off at the end of Pot Hill (Waratah Ridge) Rd after we had done Surefire I think.\"\n<\/p>\n\n\n<\/div>","rappelLongestMeters":null,"latitude":-33.4011,"waterRating":null,"name":"Dead Log","riskRating":null}
