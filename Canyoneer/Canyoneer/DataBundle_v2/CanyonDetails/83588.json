Another short bit of canyoning will lead to a second rap or handline into the first of two potholes.   It is possible these potholes could become difficult to escape although currently are full of sand and no issue.  The final rappel is 275 feet off 2 bolts and hangers and down a beautiful wall, ending in a sculpted watercourse at the end of the rappel.  Look down before passing the natural spring bubbling out of the cliff band below landing in a small grotto of calm water normally about 2 to 3 feet deep.  Use the small island on downriver side of canyon for packraft setup.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Packraft to Lee's Ferry.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Red_tape\">Red tape<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Permit needed to enter Ferry Swale with motorized vehicles upon entry.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Beta_sites\">Beta sites<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Background\">Background<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Explored long ago, this canyon was finally completed as a loop out to Lee's Ferry in the winter of 2023.  An old local fisherman, told a story, about this canyon flash flooding so hard that \"from my fishing boat, water was being tossed way out from way up there into the Colorado.  All of a sudden a bunch of 55 gallon drums came out, and then an entire cow.\"  Thus Falling Cow Canyon was born.\n<\/p>\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nParsed by mw‐api‐ext.codfw.main‐6779cc57fc‐zd82l\nCached time: 20240914191837\nCache expiry: 2592000\nReduced expiry: false\nComplications: [show‐toc]\nCPU time usage: 0.006 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.007 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 21\/1000000\nPost‐expand include size: 0\/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 0\/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 2\/100\nExpensive parser function count: 0\/500\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0\/20\nUnstrip post‐expand size: 0\/5000000 bytes\nNumber of Wikibase entities loaded: 0\/400\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%    0.000      1 -total\n-->\n<\/div>","months":[],"id":83588,"technicalRating":3,"longitude":-111.518,"geojson":null,"rappelLongestMeters":83.82,"waterRating":"B","quality":3,"riskRating":null,"permit":"No","vehicle":null,"version":"e621ab54dc69f0b725bb17d7da25d8a1d2c2a6f78719b67c1384d33129a2a268","name":"Falling Cow","rappelCountMax":3,"shuttleSeconds":null,"rappelCountMin":1}
