  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>This short canyon gives beautiful views of red sandstone cliffs and a\ncouple of fun rappels.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>Follow the walatowa loop trail to the right until you reach a small\ndrainage on the right (see <a\nhref=\"http://dougscottart.com/hobbies/SlotCanyons/Walatowa.htm\">http://dougscottart.com/hobbies/SlotCanyons/Walatowa.htm</a>\nfor map). Scramble up this then head northeast till you approach the\nslot. Stay a couple benches up and work your way up to the gap between\nthe upper and lower technical sections. Scramble up a steep drainage to\nthe right and continue skirting the slot till you can drop in at the\ntop.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>The upper portion has one 35' rap off of a deadman. After this is a\n10' drop with a deadman at the top which should not be used. It is\nfalling apart and you can get down without a rope. after the canyon\nopens up, drop down into another slot section with some easy downclimbs\nuntil you reach the 80' rap off of a sturdy tree. There was a pool at\nthe base but it was easily avoided when we were there in December.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>after the big rap, it's an easy walk down to the loop trail.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<p>Regulated by Jemez Nation. $5 hiking permit required, available at\nthe Pueblo of Jemez Welcome Center (7413 Hwy 4, Jemez Pueblo, New Mexico\n87024) directly across State Highway #4 from the Red Rocks/Walatowa\nCanyon Trailhead.</p>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><img src=\"rwl_en.png\" title=\"rwl_en.png\" alt=\"rwl_en.png\" /><a\nhref=\"http://dougscottart.com/hobbies/SlotCanyons/Walatowa.htm\">Doug\nScott's New Mexico Slot Canyons</a> : Walatowa Slot Canyon</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n"
