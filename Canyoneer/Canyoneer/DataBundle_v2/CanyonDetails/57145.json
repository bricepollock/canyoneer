{"timeRating":"III","longitude":-111.6783,"description":"<div class=\"mw-content-ltr mw-parser-output\" lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><p>A short Wet Beaver Wilderness area canyon that can be completed as a non technical hike by bypassing drops\/ pools. \n<\/p><p>Look for sign for Walker Basin Trail, then turn left down road.  Passenger vehicles can drive in a little ways on road before it gets too rough.  A few good pull outs to park. High clearance vehicles can proceed on dirt road to end at Walker Basin Trailhead. Road is in fairly good condition with a few rocky sections and dips. Follow road to High Clearance parking spot.\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Proceed through gate.  Follow Walker Basin Trail up to top of mesa.  Leave trail at top and hike cross country to main drainage.  Proceed down main drainage.  Upper section of drainage is fairly heavy in brush, stay in main drainage for easiest route.  Continue down until reaching first optional rappel.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p><b>R1:<\/b>  Optional 45' off of rock pinch down fluted section or easily downclimb LDC bypassing fluted rappel.\n<\/p><p><b>R2:<\/b>  70' off of tree RDC easily avoiding deep pothole LDC.\n<\/p><p>Avoid about 10' drop by downclimbing around RDC.\n<\/p><p>Downclimb about a 20' section of steep angled rock.\n<\/p><p><b>R3:<\/b>  60' off of tree directly back.  Best section of canyon.  Rappel drops into non-keeper pothole pool or pool can be easily avoided by going LDC with some rappel or downclimb skills. This rappel can also be bypassed on RDC by scrambling over to a brush-choked notch and thrashing down.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Continue down canyon with a few more fun down climbs.
