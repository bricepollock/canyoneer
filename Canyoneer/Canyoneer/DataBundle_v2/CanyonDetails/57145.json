Passenger vehicles can drive in a little ways on road before it gets too rough.  A few good pull outs to park. High clearance vehicles can proceed on dirt road to end at Walker Basin Trailhead. Road is in fairly good condition with a few rocky sections and dips. Follow road to High Clearance parking spot.\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Proceed through gate.
