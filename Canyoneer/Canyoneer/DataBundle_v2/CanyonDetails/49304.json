Many times\nyou can view the historic trains that pass by while you descend the canyon.  An old cabin on the exit is also a reminder of the pioneers who inhabited this area.  The views and scenery in this area is spectacular.\n<br \/><br \/>\nWith a short approach, easy side of stream walking, back to back series of quality rappels, and a short walk out (with car shuttle), Kendall Gulch is a recommended descent, however the exit up the slope between Kendall Gulch and Deer Park Creek is steep.\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>From County Road 33, descend 5min to the creek via the start of a strong game trail at the waypoint listed.<br \/>\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p><br \/>\nEasy next-to-stream walking abounds.
