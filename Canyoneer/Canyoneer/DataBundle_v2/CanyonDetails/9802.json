Below CR 14A,\nthree entities own parcels. The largest, encompassing most of the\ntechnical section (and a lot above the 14A bridge) is the Lake Lenore\nHOA. These folks have had conflicts with ice climbers trespassing in the\npast, and they do not like people parking along or going into the canyon\n- in fact, the rim of the canyon is festooned with 'no trespassing'\nsigns. Let's not make them hate canyoners as well. Please avoid this\none.</p>\n",
