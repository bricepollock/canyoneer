Below CR 14A, three entities own parcels. The largest, encompassing most of the technical section (and a lot above the 14A bridge) is the Lake Lenore HOA. These folks have had conflicts with ice climbers trespassing in the past, and they do not like people parking along or going into the canyon - in fact, the rim of the canyon is festooned with 'no trespassing' signs. Let's not make them hate canyoners as well. Please avoid this one.\n<\/p>\n\n\n<\/div>","latitude":38.0598,"id":9802,"version":"214ab31ac3072e3d378f4175721e6e7a94da12da81d14c694b260dd355b8680b","rappelCountMax":null,"technicalRating":null,"riskRating":null,"months":["Jul","Aug","Sep"],"timeRating":null,"rappelCountMin":null,"vehicle":null,"name":"Dexter Creek","shuttleSeconds":null,"permit":"Closed","url":"https:\/\/ropewiki.com\/Dexter_Creek","geojson":null}
