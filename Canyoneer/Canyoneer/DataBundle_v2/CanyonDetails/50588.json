  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>Covell Creek provides ample fun for the canyoneer looking for\ncanyoning opportunities in the Randle area. Covell is a great option\nwhen other nearby canyons are running high. With an easy approach and\nexit, the canyon features some big waterfalls and is fairly open with a\nshort narrows that adds to the appeal. Flows reduce dramatically in the\nsummer months, but the creek's low elevation and easy access make it a\ngreat option in the fall, winter, and spring.</p>\n<p>Covell offers two main options... and an experienced team could run\nboth of them in a single day.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>West Fork Covell Creek - this page describes a descent of the west\nfork</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://ropewiki.com/Covell_Creek_(Main_Fork)\">Main Fork\nCovell Creek</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Note that both forks converge below Angel Falls at about 2000ft\nelevation where a trail crosses. We'll call this spot \"the confluence.\"\nIt's a good place to check the flow on both creeks.</p>\n<p>Be aware: this area is quite popular with hikers. Use caution when\ndeploying your rope on some rappels.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Watershed: 1.16mi^2.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>Covell Creek is located just south of the Cispus Environmental\nLearning Center. Park at the location indicated and follow the trail to\nAngel Falls. Several other side trails fork off of the main trail so be\naware of this on the approach. Just before reaching Angel Falls, the\ntrail crosses the main fork of Covell Creek. Keep following the trail.\nJust ahead is Angel Falls (bottom of R2). Continue on up the Burley\nMountain trail. After several switchbacks, the trail starts to return to\nthe creek. At about: 46.42314, -121.85395 at ~2500ft elevation, there's\nan easy place to drop West Fork. Suit up and head downstream.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>DCL = Down Canyon Left, DCR = Down Canyon Right</p>\n<p><strong>West Fork</strong></p>\n<p>Push on through to a dirty downclimb / rappel, followed by a nice\narea of bedrock. The steep, slippery downclimb can be protected with a\nhandline/rappel off a small alder(?) DCL (~90' ramp). The remainder\nbefore Angel Falls can easily be downclimbed in the creek. Just ahead is\nAngel Falls.</p>\n<p>Note: <em>Angel Falls</em> consists of R1 and R2 and is a multi-pitch\nrappel. It's almost like one long ramp.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>R1: 190' from a tree DCR.</li>\n<li>R2: 190' with two anchor options: Option A from a tree DCL about 30'\nup &amp; back from the lip of the main falls, with a tricky stance but\nfree of shrubbery. Option B from a tree DCR just below a root ball, also\n30' up from the lip of the main falls. Other than a few thorny shrubs,\nOption B is a nice place to sit and anchor manage. Both lines keep you\nin the dispersed flow. With a 300'/200' rope combo you could reach the\ntree DCL right at the lip with a nice platform - this would likely keep\nthe rappeller completely out of the flow for the 2nd pitch.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>After R2, head downstream to the confluence. The water flow doubles\n(or more) as the main fork of Covell Creek enters DCR. (After this the\nbeta is the same as the main fork.)</p>\n<p><strong>Below the Confluence: (BC)</strong></p>\n<p>Continue downstream with 1-2 downclimbs until you reach BC-R1. If\nflow is too high, climb back up to the main trail and exit.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>BC-R1: 75' from fallen log DCR into a nice narrows.</li>\n<li>BC-R2: 75' from a tree DCL. This is <em>Covell Creek Falls</em> and\nis a great spot for photos. Signs around the watercourse request hikers\nto remain on the trail to avoid trampling the fragile plant life below\nthe falls. Try to remain in the creek bed to access photo spots, and/or\nif continuing downstream.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Two established trails connect and travel under the falls. Exit\ncanyon right to return to your cars on trail. At the immediate junction,\nhead downhill, then bushwhack a short bit to the road. Hike up the road\na short ways to your cars. Alternatively, a longer, more scenic exit\ntakes the right fork at that junction, and wraps around a nice cliff\nband. This will take you directly to your cars.</p>\n<p>Below Covell Creek Falls is a high tourist area as there's a trail\njust above the creek DCR. Leaving fixed anchors is not recommended.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>BC-R3: 20ft just below Covell Creek Falls. Anchor off a fallen log\nspanning the creek.</li>\n<li>BC-R4: 20ft drop a short distance downstream. Anchor off a fallen\nlog spanning the creek.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There are a few more short drops further downstream, but they may not\nbe worth your time. It's an easy exit up DCR to the trail.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>Exit immediately up DCR to the well-maintained trail just above the\ncreek. Head downstream following the trail to where the old bridge was.\nThe new trail loops back toward the parking area. Wahoo!</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<p>None.</p>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<p><a\nhref=\"https://www.facebook.com/harukajames.lipscomb/media_set?set=a.1379525298840636&amp;type=3&amp;pnref=story\">Facebook\nAlbum - First Descent on 12/30/2017</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n<p>This route was first descended on a cold winter December day\n(12/30/2017) by Barry Specht, Ryan Ernst, Haruka-James Lipscomb, and\nTiffanie Lin.</p>\n",
