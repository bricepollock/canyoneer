  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>We rappelled the first two drops of this (95' from a small tree\ncenter canyon and 95' from a tree LDC) and then bailed at an easy escape\nLDC. This was followed by a big two stage (~190'?) with potential for\nsome natural anchors in the big bowl maybe 120 feet down. From what we\nsaw from the approach road west of the canyon, there are probably some\neven bigger waterfalls further down. The canyon below didn't look deep\nbut it wasn't clear if there might be some committing sections due to\nhow sheer the surrounding landscape is. The largest drop we estimated at\nover 220' but with a big mid-wall hanging bowl with potential for\nnatural anchors. This canyons is a good candidate for bolting. Probably\nover 8 rappels.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>Drive up the gravel road that switchbacks up from the top of Tzununa\nand look for a big trail on a switchback used to access the milpas east\nof the road.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>would likely consist of walking back up the road to your vehicle or\nhiring a tuc-tuc back up.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n"
