This was followed by a big two stage (~190'?) with potential for some natural anchors in the big bowl maybe 120 feet down. From what we saw from the approach road west of the canyon, there are probably some even bigger waterfalls further down. The canyon below didn't look deep but it wasn't clear if there might be some committing sections due to how sheer the surrounding landscape is. The largest drop we estimated at over 220' but with a big mid-wall hanging bowl with potential for natural anchors. This canyons is a good candidate for bolting. Probably over 8 rappels.\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Drive up the gravel road that switchbacks up from the top of Tzununa and look for a big trail on a switchback used to access the milpas east of the road.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>would likely consist of walking back up the road to your vehicle or hiring a tuc-tuc back up.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Red_tape\">Red tape<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Beta_sites\">Beta sites<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Background\">Background<\/h2><\/div>\n\n\n<\/div>"}
