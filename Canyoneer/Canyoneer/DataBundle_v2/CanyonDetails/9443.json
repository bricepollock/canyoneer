technically challenging and rewarding than otherwise. The optimal season is winter when the drops are covered in spectacular ice falls with brown water flowing down the sandstone. It is a sight to see. But in winter, the approach is through snow and otherwise simple downclimbs pose a new threat. Creativity with partner assists and pack-drag anchors are the name of the game. \nIf you go in summer or Fall, it may be bone dry and be very uninteresting.\nAlthough this canyon is not in the Colorado National Monument, it is in the Monument sub-group since it is in the Grand Junction area.\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>From the parking lot at 39.18137,-108.2737 start heading straight up the nose on the southwest to gain the top of the mesa. About halfway up you will encounter a cliff band you need to defeat. The crux move is at 5400 feet elevation at 39.17678,-108.27251 and has some exposure, much more difficult with slippery ice and snow. Slightly higher you need to get through the top cliffband, which can be done easily through a hole at 39.17601,-108.2725. Once you gain the mesa, keep below the 5800 foot level and head south until the power lines come into view. Real Hairy is exactly below these lines, but you don't want to go too far west as it's unnecessary, and you don't want to go too far east or you will have to make some difficult gully crossings. 5700-5750 feet seems to be the sweet spot.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<ul><li><b>R0: 39.17022,-10825777,<\/b> Entrance rappel from tree anchor on canyon rim, 75-105 feet depending on chosen tree.
