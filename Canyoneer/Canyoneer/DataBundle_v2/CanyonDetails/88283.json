Certainly a 5-star canyon when you add it all up.\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>From the beginning parking, follow a faint use-trail down the bush almost directly, staying on the right side of a property line fence. Near the bottom, jog right once to find a walk in.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Starts with 2 or 3 short rappels under 100 feet. Then you reach the 300’ waterfall ending with 170’ guided rappel double bolts for bottom anchor. Wade across pool to Dragons Lair hot springs and scramble up to 50 feet to the lair for a sublime view out of the belly of the dragon. 300m swim through narrows, 10’ river walk, 100m swim, 10’ river walk, 50m swim, 15’ trail. On river right you come to a ranch.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>At the ranch there is cold potable water, shade, benches, banter. You can and should hire a porter to take bags up on ranch UTV for $Rial5 each which is well worth it. The hike out from the ranch to the shuttle parking is a very steep 700’ gain in 1\/2 mile.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Red_tape\">Red tape<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>You need to cross private property at the exit from the river and go up a private road to the shuttle parking. Best to make arrangements with the ranch owner first, although he is familiar with canyoneers so as long as you have the fee on hand it may be okay without reservations.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Beta_sites\">Beta sites<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Background\">Background<\/h2><\/div>\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nParsed by mw‐api‐ext.codfw.main‐6779cc57fc‐m8c98\nCached time: 20240914192123\nCache expiry: 2592000\nReduced expiry: false\nComplications: [show‐toc]\nCPU time usage: 0.005 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.006 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 21\/1000000\nPost‐expand include size: 0\/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 0\/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 2\/100\nExpensive parser function count: 0\/500\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0\/20\nUnstrip post‐expand size: 0\/5000000 bytes\nNumber of Wikibase entities loaded: 0\/400\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%    0.000      1 -total\n-->\n<\/div>","waterRating":"C","rappelCountMin":5,"rappelLongestMeters":91.44,"timeRating":"III","rappelCountMax":6,"latitude":-14.1711,"vehicle":"4WD - High Clearance","name":"Dragons Lair","months":[],"geojson":null,"longitude":-47.3322,"riskRating":null,"version":"3264c668059674d81b107be93f01f0dc5d15136b57869415d8e229dba9371daf"}
