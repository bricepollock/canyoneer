It is also possible to set up a car shuttle between the two primary trailheads.\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading3\"><h3 id=\"Snow_Canyon_Approach\">Snow Canyon Approach<\/h3><\/div>\n<p>Park at the Sand Dunes Picnic Grounds.  Hike north on the Whiptail Trail \/ West Canyon Road (the road likely won't be accessible to vehicles) for about a half mile until a sandy wash comes in on the west (right).  There will be a two gullies in view, a wide and a narrow gully (north of the wide gully).  Aim for the narrow gully.  An apparent social trail near the base of this gully should make it easier to navigate.  As you proceed up the (narrow) gully there will be a wall\/saddle to the north.  Look for a point to scramble up and over this dropping you into the Pictograph Canyon wash.  From here work your way up canyon passing the another gully on your left.  Soon you will reach a junction a large steep gully on the west (left) and the bottom of Pictograph Canyon on the north. This large gully is known as the Tuacahn Chimney and is the approach to the top (or exit for the Tuachan approach\/exit).  Near the top of the Tuacahn Chimney is a fin in the middle splitting the gully into two pathways. It is recommended to scramble up the south (Left Up Canyon) pathway untill a large cairn is encountered denoting the top of the chimney. \n<\/p><p>From this point begin route-finding your way to the first rappel making your way in a northerly direction while keeping Pictograph Canyon in view on you right. There is an area noted with black rocks that you want to aim for that is about midway from the top of the Tuacahn Chimney and the first rappel.  To access the first rappel, you will walk\/slide down a somewhat narrow shelf to the anchor.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading3\"><h3 id=\"Tuacahn_Approach\">Tuacahn Approach<\/h3><\/div>\n<p>This approach route starts at the Padre Canyon Trailhead.  You may be able to park in the Tuacahn parking lot, or you may have to park further away and hike in.  Either way you want to start out heading north on the Padre Canyon trail looking for a large boulder immediately on the west (left) side of the trail which marks the point where you leave the trail.  From here a social trail heads east\/northeast towards some fins or fingers of rock.  Scramble up these, keeping to the middle fin.  It is exposed on both sides, but not difficult.  Once on top of the fins, there will be an obvious opening with boulders to scramble up.  Keep making your way upward in the same direction untill you come to the top of a large steep gully dropping down towards the east.  There should be a large cairn marking this spot.  This is the top of what is known as the Tuacahn Chimney and will make part of the exit if returning this way.\n<\/p><p>From this point begin route-finding your way to the first rappel making your way in a northerly direction while keeping Pictograph Canyon in view on you right.

The first four anchors come in quick succession and the canyon is somewhat open and wide--at least compared to the narrow section that follows.  At the bottom of the fourth anchor the canyon has a bunch or scrub and boulders to navigate\/downclimb on the way to the fifth anchor.  From there the canyon slots up and drops somewhat untill opening back up and becoming brushy again around the seventh anchor.  After the seventh anchor, if exiting towards Tuacahn you will proceed up the Tuacahn Chimney once the junction is reached.  If exiting via Snow Canyon you will have the option to descend the final eighth anchor.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading3\"><h3 id=\"Rappels\">Rappels<\/h3><\/div>\n<p><b>R1<\/b>: 100ft.
