A few rocky spots. Good tires as lots of sharp rock.\n<\/p><p>Hike down to dry creek bed. Follow creek bed a little ways up stream. Hike up ridge to saddle north of Byous Butte. Follow light use trail on west side of saddle north. Head up to saddle going west. Head down into canyon. Head down canyon to first rappel. Brush is sparse and not as bad as most Superstition Mountain canyons.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p><b>R1:<\/b> 60' off of boulder pinch. Two tier rappel into two spring feed pools. Pools can be easily avoided by staying LDC while on rappel. Pools are shin deep at most if prefer to go in.\n<\/p><p>A few downclimbs. Including a 7' drop that can be partner assisted down or meat anchored. Possible to use rock chock RDC for rappel.\n<\/p><p><b>R2:<\/b> 70' off of large boulder. Best to go in flow, as there is a large tree directly below drop LDC if attempting to avoid getting wet.\n<\/p><p>Continue down canyon drainage with a few boulder down climbs.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Continue in canyon drainage to road. Brush in the canyon drainage is very few. Outside canyon drainage is horrific.
