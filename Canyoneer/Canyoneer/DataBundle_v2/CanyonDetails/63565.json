Climb the gully nearly to the top, where a wider ledge layer can be followed around to the top of the south fork (Play it Again Sam: <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external free\" href=\"http:\/\/ropewiki.com\/Casablanca_Canyon_(South_Fork))\">http:\/\/ropewiki.com\/Casablanca_Canyon_(South_Fork))<\/a> at 37.982024, -110.481763.  From here, look for a spot to climb up a ledge. Contour around until you're above the north fork, then find your way, zig-zagging down through boulders and a series of ledges into the canyon and to the top of the rappel at 37.982314, -110.484460.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>The anchor is set from a large boulder about 20 feet back from the drop. Use a Fiddlestick or smooth operator to pull from this anchor, or set up a longer anchor that extends closer to the edge for an easier pull.  The rappel looks deceivingly big.  Pass two ledges on the way down - from the second one you can check that your rope is on the ground before proceeding.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>A short walk with a little bit of easy scrambling down lower Casablanca Canyon will return you to your car.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Red_tape\">Red tape<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Beta_sites\">Beta sites<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Background\">Background<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Dave Pimental, who explored many of the short slots around Hog Springs, including Morocco, Hogwarts, and Merry Piglet, referred to this canyon as Casablanca Canyon.

The lower canyon ends with views of alcoves and a dry fall. \n<\/p><p>\"Black Swallow\" is the dryfall on the north side of the dead end (left side looking up canyon). The name is a tribute to the amazing life and accomplishments of Eugene Bullard. Eugene's connections with the movie Casablanca include that he owned a night club in Paris where movie stars were known to frequent, and he employed Casablanca's \"Sam\", Arthur Wilson, as a member of the house band.  Black Swallow was Eugene's nickname as a fighter pilot during World War I. <a class=\"external free\" href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Eugene_Bullard\">https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Eugene_Bullard<\/a>.\n<\/p><p>See also: <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external free\" href=\"http:\/\/ropewiki.com\/Casablanca_Canyon_(South_Fork)\">http:\/\/ropewiki.com\/Casablanca_Canyon_(South_Fork)<\/a>\n<\/p>\n\n\n<\/div>","id":63565,"name":"Casablanca Canyon (North Fork)","quality":0,"months":[],"rappelCountMax":1,"shuttleSeconds":null,"permit":"No","longitude":-110.4845,"timeRating":"I","latitude":37.9823,"riskRating":null,"version":"bfd14fa5e9c638bb420430160d4a67fa6dd3d2805878955a1ba0735f71574d54","technicalRating":3,"geojson":null,"url":"https:\/\/ropewiki.com\/Casablanca_Canyon_(North_Fork)","waterRating":"A","rappelLongestMeters":48.77}
