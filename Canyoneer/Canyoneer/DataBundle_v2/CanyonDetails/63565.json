From here, look for a spot to climb up a ledge. Contour around until you're above the north fork, then find your way, zig-zagging down through boulders and a series of ledges into the canyon and to the top of the rappel at 37.982314, -110.484460.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>The anchor is set from a large boulder about 20 feet back from the drop. Use a Fiddlestick or smooth operator to pull from this anchor, or set up a longer anchor that extends closer to the edge for an easier pull.  The rappel looks deceivingly big.

The lower canyon ends with views of alcoves and a dry fall. \n<\/p><p>\"Black Swallow\" is the dryfall on the north side of the dead end (left side looking up canyon). The name is a tribute to the amazing life and accomplishments of Eugene Bullard. Eugene's connections with the movie Casablanca include that he owned a night club in Paris where movie stars were known to frequent, and he employed Casablanca's \"Sam\", Arthur Wilson, as a member of the house band.  Black Swallow was Eugene's nickname as a fighter pilot during World War I. <a class=\"external free\" href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Eugene_Bullard\">https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Eugene_Bullard<\/a>.\n<\/p><p>See also: <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external free\" href=\"http:\/\/ropewiki.com\/Casablanca_Canyon_(South_Fork)\">http:\/\/ropewiki.com\/Casablanca_Canyon_(South_Fork)<\/a>\n<\/p>\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nParsed by mw‐api‐ext.codfw.main‐6779cc57fc‐sqkbz\nCached time: 20240914191901\nCache expiry: 2592000\nReduced expiry: false\nComplications: [show‐toc]\nCPU time usage: 0.006 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.007 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 21\/1000000\nPost‐expand include size: 0\/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 0\/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 2\/100\nExpensive parser function count: 0\/500\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0\/20\nUnstrip post‐expand size: 0\/5000000 bytes\nNumber of Wikibase entities loaded: 0\/400\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%    0.000      1 -total\n-->\n<\/div>","url":"https:\/\/ropewiki.com\/Casablanca_Canyon_(North_Fork)","timeRating":"I","quality":0}
