  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>Basically just a stunt rappel.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>From the Casablanca canyon parking area walk up the canyon until you\nencounter a gully on the south (37.982024, -110.481763). Climb the gully\nnearly to the top, where a wider ledge layer can be followed around to\nthe top of the south fork (Play it Again Sam: <a\nhref=\"http://ropewiki.com/Casablanca_Canyon_(South_Fork)\">http://ropewiki.com/Casablanca_Canyon_(South_Fork)</a>)\nat 37.982024, -110.481763. From here, look for a spot to climb up a\nledge. Contour around until you're above the north fork, then find your\nway, zig-zagging down through boulders and a series of ledges into the\ncanyon and to the top of the rappel at 37.982314, -110.484460.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>The anchor is set from a large boulder about 20 feet back from the\ndrop. Use a Fiddlestick or smooth operator to pull from this anchor, or\nset up a longer anchor that extends closer to the edge for an easier\npull. The rappel looks deceivingly big. Pass two ledges on the way down\n- from the second one you can check that your rope is on the ground\nbefore proceeding.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>A short walk with a little bit of easy scrambling down lower\nCasablanca Canyon will return you to your car.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n<p>Dave Pimental, who explored many of the short slots around Hog\nSprings, including Morocco, Hogwarts, and Merry Piglet, referred to this\ncanyon as Casablanca Canyon. The minislot Guide for Morocco Canyon shows\nthis canyon as \"Casablanca\" <a\nhref=\"http://www.math.utah.edu/~sfolias/minislot/canyons/?i=morocco\">http://www.math.utah.edu/~sfolias/minislot/canyons/?i=morocco</a>.\nSee also: <a\nhref=\"http://www.math.utah.edu/~sfolias/canyontales/canyonames/#nwt\">http://www.math.utah.edu/~sfolias/canyontales/canyonames/#nwt</a>.</p>\n<p>The bottom of Casablanca Canyon affords a short scenic walk with some\nminor scrambling. The lower canyon ends with views of alcoves and a dry\nfall.</p>\n<p>\"Black Swallow\" is the dryfall on the north side of the dead end\n(left side looking up canyon). The name is a tribute to the amazing life\nand accomplishments of Eugene Bullard. Eugene's connections with the\nmovie Casablanca include that he owned a night club in Paris where movie\nstars were known to frequent, and he employed Casablanca's \"Sam\", Arthur\nWilson, as a member of the house band. Black Swallow was Eugene's\nnickname as a fighter pilot during World War I. <a\nhref=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugene_Bullard\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugene_Bullard</a>.</p>\n<p>See also: <a\nhref=\"http://ropewiki.com/Casablanca_Canyon_(South_Fork)\">http://ropewiki.com/Casablanca_Canyon_(South_Fork)</a></p>\n"
