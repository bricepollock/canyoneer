The creek sports a number of short drops between 1000’ and 2000’ elevation. This is another good creek for training and practice, but requires more work to get to. A new clear cut on the west side of the creek (2023) may actually improve access. Woodward is similar in character to <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http:\/\/ropewiki.com\/Duncan_Creek\">Duncan Creek<\/a> next door, but has more creek-walking. The approach and exit require bushwhacking.\n<\/p><p><font color=\"red\">Update: May 2020: In shuttling up to the top, we ran into a bunch of new \"No Trespassing\" signs along the road about 0.5mi up from the end of pavement and a hostile local. We've been using Kueffler Road to access the falls for years, so barricading the road is of dubious legality.  Until this is resolved, it may be better to hike in to avoid conflicts.<\/font>\n<\/p><p><font color=\"green\">\nUpdate: May 2023: While walking the road, we met a couple of friendly locals (Torbin and his mother). They encouraged us to drive the road and use the trails as they are getting overgrown without use. The \"hostile local\" is known to the neighbors as the local curmudgeon and harmless. If driving the road, please pass his home (bus) slowly, minimizing dust and keeping noise to a minimum. If confronted we were advised to smile, wave and keep moving. If anyone in the area asks questions, we were told to say: \"We are friends of Torbin.\"\n<\/font>\n<\/p>\n<ul><li>Woodward Creek has one minor tributary of interest:  <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http:\/\/ropewiki.com\/Little_Woodward_Creek\">Little Woodward Creek<\/a><\/li>\n<li>It used to be possible to bushwhack up the west side of the creek from below and run the main technical section (best part of the creek). As of 2023, the bushwhacking is quite thick and navigation is required.

Turn right and follow the somewhat overgrown road downwards 0.5mi to small pullout just before a bridge over the West Fork. There's room for a few vehicles here. There is a walk-in campsite on the east side of the bridge.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading3\"><h3 id=\"Shuttle_to_the_Upper_Trailhead\">Shuttle to the Upper Trailhead<\/h3><\/div>\n<p>From the lower trailhead, backtrack to Hwy 14 and continue east 1.7mi.  Just before the park HQ building at Beacon Rock State Park, turn off left\/north on Kueffler Rd (signed).  Follow Kueffler Rd upwards for ~4mi. Park on the shoulder at a location where the road swings north. One-way drive time: ~20min.  There may be a cairn marking the location to drop into the creek.\n<\/p><p>Special Notes:\n<\/p>\n<ul><li>At the end of the county road (end of pavement) is a sign stating that unauthorized vehicles are not permitted further.  This sign is bogus.  The road beyond is a publicly accessible Forest Service road regularly used by locals, loggers, four-wheelers, hikers, rock climbers, waterfall hunters, etc.  On one trip we saw a police officer up here and he just waved at us.  The sign was likely installed by locals to keep out the riffraff as there's a few private homes further up.

The track heads south, then swings back north, emerging into a powerline corridor.  Follow the powerline east to approximately UTM 10 573849mE 5055197mN where an old logging grade crosses the corridor.  Watch carefully as the grade angles back sharply left \/ northwest;  it's easy to miss.  This grade is not hiked very often and may be brushy.  Follow this track (now trail) northwards, then east.  Once you get going, the old grade is easy to follow.  It eventually reaches the east fork of Woodward Creek.  Boulder\/log-hop across at the old bridge site and scramble back up to the grade.  Follow the grade upwards past a burned-out car and continue following the grade to the left which will end at a gate at Kueffler Rd.  Turn left and follow Kueffler Rd about 1.8mi to the upper trailhead. The hike takes about 1.5 hours.  Total distance: ~3mi, 1200ft gain.
