class=\"mw-content-ltr mw-parser-output\" lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><p>Gargoyles is a charming canyon that cascades off the eastern flank of Del Campo Peak in the Gothic Basin.  The canyon drops 1,100 feet in less than 0.4 miles and offers a number of nice multi-tiered waterfalls, ending in a scenic final sequence at the valley bottom.  \n<\/p><p>This canyon is committing.  Although it may be possible to escape at some points, the hillsides are steep and rocky and navigating them would be difficult and risky.\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>From the Barlow Pass Trailhead, head southeast for approximately 300 feet until you come across the sign for Weden Creek Trail (#724) on your right.  Head up the trail for 2.9 miles and 1,600 feet of elevation gain until the creek intersects the trail underneath a nice view of Del Campo Peak.  This is the waterflow checkpoint.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p><b>PLEASE NOTE:<\/b> \n<\/p>\n<ul><li>The entire canyon is a terrain trap and prone to winter avalanches, which has caused anchor damage in the past.  Be aware of this if you are the first group of the season and ensure you have the skills and materials in your group to inspect and\/or rebuild all anchors.  The canyon has plenty of natural anchor-building materials throughout to build cairn anchors.<\/li><\/ul>\n<ul><li>Where bolted, this canyon uses unlinked bolts.  Please do not leave webbing or other linking materials on any bolt stations.<\/li><\/ul>\n<ul><li>A smaller tributary joins the main drainage after the third rappel.  If flow already looks high, you can check the volume of the additional drainage prior to dropping in by continuing up to approach trail for another minute or so after the main drainage.<\/li><\/ul>\n<ul><li>The first part of the exit from the creek back to the trail would be difficult to navigate in the dark, even with GPS.  It is recommended to start early enough to ensure that there will be enough daylight to make it back to the trail.<\/li><\/ul>\n<p>The first rappel is about 25 yards downcanyon from the trail.\n<\/p><p><b>R1:<\/b> 70' DCL from single bolt DCL\n<\/p><p><b>R2:<\/b> 100' DCR from unlinked bolts DCR\n<\/p><p><b>R3:<\/b> 120' DCL from unlinked bolts. There is a short 15' waterfall immediately following this waterfall. It can be downclimbed without difficulty in moderate conditions.\n<\/p><p>A tributary joins from DCR after R3 that adds about 25% more water to the flow.\n<\/p><p><b>R4:<\/b> 40' DCR from single bolt \n<\/p><p><b>R5:<\/b> 200' DCL from single bolt.  Use a single traverse line bolt to access the rappel anchor on a small ledge.  Two-stage rappel.\n<\/p><p><b>R6:<\/b> 50' from cairn anchor.  Natural anchor building material is plentiful.\n<\/p><p><b>R7:<\/b> 100' DCR from single bolt.  Two-stage rappel.\n<\/p><p>There is a broad, open rim before the drops become more tightly clustered in an aesthetic final sequence. The next four falls (in two rappels) from the top of the rim are 'The Gargoyles', the final one featuring a rooster tail in moderate  conditions.\n<\/p><p><b>R8:<\/b> 180' DCL from single bolt near the edge. This is a beautiful rappel line where the main waterfall shoots overhead and you are in the spray, which becomes more concentrated as you descend.  Two-stage rappel.\n<\/p><p><b>R9:<\/b> 180' DCR from unlinked bolts below small pothole. Another two-stage rappel with a rooster tail on the final stage.\n<\/p><p><b>R10:<\/b> 20' DCR from single bolt. This rappel has been downclimbed.\n<\/p><p>Scramble down to the canyon exit.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Long pants are recommended for the exit. The GPS track on the map is very accurate as of 2021, and it is recommended to follow that. Follow the creek rubble veering left as long as you can. It becomes overgrown - be careful of sudden drops or loose boulders hidden by the brush. Continue following the path of least resistance, continuing to angle left, eventually entering brushy hardwoods. Once you enter the pine forest, the walking becomes significantly easier. Follow the GPS track and begin looking for pink flagging after about 100 yards. In 2021, a clear path that avoids devils club and thick brush was flagged, with each flag visible from the prior. The flagging ends at a large root ball. At this point, angle uphill, continuing to follow the GPS track. Be sure to angle right - going straight up will cause you to miss the trail's switchback. Rejoin the trail and follow it out for about an hour back to your car.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Red_tape\">Red tape<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Northwest Forest Pass required to park at the Barlow Pass Trailhead\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Beta_sites\">Beta sites<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media<\/h2><\/div>\n<p><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/tiffanie.lin\/media_set?set=a.10109170049214768&amp;type=3\">Facebook Album - First Descent photos on June 30, 2019<\/a>\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Background\">Background<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>This canyon was first descended on June 30, 2019 by Jake Huddleston, Kevin Steffa, and Tiffanie Lin.
