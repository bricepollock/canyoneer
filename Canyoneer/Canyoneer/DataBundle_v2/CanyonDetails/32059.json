Not otherwise worth it.  More of a steep hike to a cliff than a real canyon, but the exit is really pretty. Very pristine area in the Los Padres National Forest.\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Park alongside road 166 East about 22 miles from Hwy 101 in Santa Maria.  (Choose the turnout just after Gomez Ranch, which will be on your left). Walk down and cross the wash, following the cow trails. Head up the ridge to the left of the obvious dry fall.  As you reach the top of the ridge the grass will turn to sage - skirt along the right side of the ridge and make your way across to the ridgeline above the dry waterfall\/cliff. You can cut into the wash just above the first rappel, which is the top of the obvious dry fall.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>The first rappel is off a big cairn. d 200' rope will reach the bottom. Immediately after this free hanging rappel (180') there is another cairn with about a 40' drop.  Be mindful of the poison oak. There is a large hawks' nest half way down the rappel.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>The creek continues back to where you started the approach, however, we exited to the left along a very steep deer trail. It follows the ridge and is very pretty and keeps you out of the poison oak filled creek.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Red_tape\">Red tape<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Depending on where you approach from the road, you may have to climb over a cow fence. There is a  private cattle ranch that grazes in the area.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Beta_sites\">Beta sites<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media<\/h2><\/div>\n<ul><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external free\" href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/danielle.monroy.9\/media_set?set=a.10154843275697656.1073742017.706802655&amp;type=3\">https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/danielle.monroy.9\/media_set?set=a.10154843275697656.1073742017.706802655&amp;type=3<\/a><\/li><\/ul>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Background\">Background<\/h2><\/div>\n\n\n<\/div>","longitude":-120.1338}
