{"description":"<div class=\"mw-content-ltr mw-parser-output\" lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><p>Glennifer is one of the top canyons in Australia. It is technically challenging and spectacular.\n<\/p><p>The canyon is highly technical with hanging anchors, multipoint traverse lines and redirects across flow.  It require competence and experience with contemporary single rope canyoning techniques. The ropework is demanding. All party members must have experience and are comfortable in v5a4 to v6a5.\n<\/p><p>There are no exits. Any external rescue will take many, many hours.\n<\/p><p>Parties should be ready to replace bolts, and re-equip redirects.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading3\"><h3 id=\"Water_level\">Water level<\/h3><\/div>\n<p><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https:\/\/waterinsights.waternsw.com.au\/14303-never-never-creek\/river-data#205019\">205019 Never Never at Old Crossing - WaterNSW WaterInsights<\/a>\n<\/p>\n<ul><li>&lt;15 ML\/d: v5a4 low water volume<\/li>\n<li>&gt;15 ML\/d - &lt;100 ML\/d: v5a4 high water volume<\/li>\n<li>100 - 150: v6a5<\/li>\n<li>&gt;150 = Stay home<\/li><\/ul>\n<p>Highest known descent is 150 ML.\n<\/p><p>See the trip reports section for the river at various heights.\n<\/p><p>The catchment is 18 km&#178; in a high rainfall area which floods regularly. The river can flash-flood. The sheer volume of water (up to ~33,700 ML\/d recorded on 18 March 2017) that can flow through this canyon necessitates that you take a drill and bolts in case exisiting anchors have been damaged (and they have in the past!)\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>A car shuffle is required. Consider placing the bottom car the night before to optimise your time on the canyoning day. Park the bottom car at Never Never River on Promised Land Road. If you have a 4wd, drive up Tallowwood Road as far as you can - this will make for a slightly shorter walk out. \n<\/p><p>Then do the long drive up to Mount Moombil and park the top car.\n<\/p><p>Walk-in: Follow the GPX down the ridge from Mount Moombil, skirt northwards around Mount Goobergooberyam (there is an unmarked logging track here), eventually going down the ridge to the Never Never river. Arrive pretty much to come out just above the falls - nice big rock on CL where you can get changed.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>The abseil table below is authoritative.\n<\/p><p><br \/>\n<\/p><p><br \/>\n<\/p>\n<table class=\"wikitable\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Gleniffer\n<\/td><\/tr>\n<tr>\n<th>Rap<\/th>\n<th>M<\/th>\n<th>L\/R<\/th>\n<th>Description\n<\/th><\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><\/td>\n<td>5<\/td>\n<td>CL<\/td>\n<td>Jump into pool with log - bit of a flush over in high water\n<\/td><\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>R1<\/td>\n<td><\/td>\n<td><\/td>\n<td>CL (higher flow) or CR\n<\/td><\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>R1a<\/td>\n<td>10m<\/td>\n<td>CR<\/td>\n<td>Double bolt anchor.

If you don’t use redirect bolts, you have to do a small climb in the corner to get up onto the ledge. On this ledge there is a single bolt you can use to set a guided rappel if necessary.

Good idea to stick to edge of rainforest on CR until the creek gets a bit flatter - means that you avoid the boulder hopping. About 500m before Howards Road meets the creek there is a path on CR of the river (may have to go up through trees a bit to get to it) - follow this path, then go up Howards Road and along Tallowwood Road to car.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Red_tape\">Red tape<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Beta_sites\">Beta sites<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>(Click through the picture)\n<\/p><p>UNSW Outdoor Club 2 Feb 2020, 66 ML, \"semi sporty\".\n<\/p><p><br \/>\n<\/p><p><br \/>\nGlenniffer at 55 ML (Facebook link), \"Good water level for never having done the canyon, did most of the full flow anchors, didn't need any of the redirect bolts\"\n<\/p><p><br \/>\n<\/p><p><br \/>\nGlenniffer at 150 ML (Facebook link), \"Highest known descent yet\"\n<\/p><p><br \/>\n<\/p><p><br \/>\nGleniffer Canyon at 35 ML\n<\/p><p><br \/>\n<\/p><p><br \/>\nGleniffer Canyon at 15.5 ML\n<\/p><p><br \/>\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading3\"><h3 id=\"Re-opening_Descent\">Re-opening Descent<\/h3><\/div>\n<p><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/australiancanyoners\/permalink\/448264169233943\">Mitchell Stewart - March 29 2019<\/a>\n<\/p><p>Ryan Hunter, Alex O'Connor Mason and myself made a full descent of Gleniffer Falls canyon on Wednesday the 20th of February, 2019. \nThis canyon is intimidating and steep and features some of the best waterfall abseils in Australia. This trip is one of the top three outdoor experiences I've ever had in Australia. The slot in the lower part of the falls terrifying yet spectacular!!\nWe saw almost no evidence of previous descents, indicating that the waterway has the potential to pick up large amounts of rock and log debris destroying any anchor systems put in place. This was evident by the large logs that were seen high up on a ledge in the first large pool system. Our party has been canyoning in many countries around the world and we are very experienced in high flow canyons. We recognised many signs of what this canyon is capable of in the wrong (wet...) conditions. It is not recommended to enter this canyon before, during, or after rain and without the ability to replace bolted anchors (hammer drill and bolting kit is required). \n<\/p><p>After the 3rd abseil... you are totally committed to the descent, so be aware that there are no escape routes and you must be confident in your experience and ability to commit to a full descent.\n80m ropes are ESSENTIAL and we recommend taking three ropes... be WELL prepared for an overnight stay with space blankets and food. \nBtw utmost respect to Dicky Baker, Andy Robb, Brian Cork, and Dan for their efforts involved with this tremendous canyon.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Background\">Background<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>First descent in
