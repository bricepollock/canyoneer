  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>Although not a spectacular canyon itself, Jaguar is a great option to\ndo the day after <a href=\"Chorreadero\" title=\"wikilink\">Chorreadero</a>\nbecause it is dry and makes for a light day. In Chorreadero you will\nspend hours swimming in the water and come out like a prune so it is\nnice to plan a dry day afterwards. The highlight of Jaguar is the 3rd\nrappel, a 410 foot multi-pitch rappel. Otherwise, it is unremarkable\nexcept for the tremendous volume of trash particularly in the beginning\nhalf. The term trashwacking was thus born.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>Park the exit vehicle at 16.75490,-92.9716. Drive a few short miles\nto a narrow pull-out on the left above a steep hillside at either the\ntrash wall approach (16.7625, -92.9583) or the standard Chorreadero\napproach (16.76108, -92.95248).</p>\n<h3 id=\"trash_wall_approach\">Trash wall approach</h3>\n<p>On the west side of the narrow pull-out is a use trail that makes a\nsharp descent to the drainage for Chorreadero. Note the entrance for\nChorreadero, then cross the drainage at the cave mouth.-92.95958.</p>\n<h3 id=\"standard_approach_recommended\">Standard approach\n(recommended)</h3>\n<p>At the white gate, take the well-traveled trail toward the drainage\nvia the GPS route shown for Chorreadero. The cave mouth is a few minutes\ndownstream.</p>\n<h3 id=\"both_approaches\">Both approaches</h3>\n<p>At the cave mouth, scramble up a small ravine RDC that starts on the\nright (up-canyon) side of the rock wall that marks the entrance to\nChorreadero. The very faint and overgrown use trail becomes visible\nagain near the top of this ravine and veers left. Take it to the first\nrappel at 16.76263, -92.95958.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>R1</strong>: Tree, 70 feet. Optional rebelay off bolts about\n10 feet down. The transition from the first to second rappel does not\nhave much space. It's recommended for all but the LAPAR to rappel off\nthe tree. LAPAR should consider the rebelay due to possible pull\nissues.</li>\n<li><strong>R2</strong>: Bolts Left, 60 feet.</li>\n<li><strong>R3</strong>: 410 foot multi-pitch:\n<ul>\n<li>First pitch is 30 feet from bolts left (can be downclimbed with\nskill and in dry conditions)</li>\n<li>Second pitch is from bolts with chain LDC (before the obvious drop\noff; keep an eye out for them on your way down pitch 1). It's 150 feet\nto a small ledge that can fit 3 people.</li>\n<li>Third pitch is 230 feet from 2 bolts. If you don't have a 230'+\nrope, it may be able to be split into two: 130' to a large ledge with\ntrees, fourth pitch is 100 feet from one of several trees.</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li><strong>R4</strong>: Bolts Middle on the edge of the drop, 100\nfeet.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>Hike down the drainage to the bathrooms at the bottom of Chorreadero.\nFrom the bathrooms to the parking lot is a 3 minute walk.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<p>As of May 2021, leaving your car unprotected on the side of the road\nat start of the approach seems pretty safe. The pullout was shared with\nother cars. To leave your car at the exit was 200 pesos per person (not\nper car), which is a lot of money for the area. Prices may change\ndepending on who is manning the parking lot.</p>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n"
