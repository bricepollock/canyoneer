In Chorreadero you will spend hours swimming in the water and come out like a prune so it is nice to plan a dry day afterwards. The highlight of Jaguar is the 3rd rappel, a 410 foot multi-pitch rappel. Otherwise, it is unremarkable except for the tremendous volume of trash particularly in the beginning half. The term trashwacking was thus born.\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Park the exit vehicle at 16.75490,-92.9716.
