  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>A large valley, but the rock is not good to form a deep canyon. Many\nboulders on the way down.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>From the parking cross the village, and walk up the hiking trail\nuntil you reach the \"Niwa Suone\" (\"new irrigation canal\"). This one goes\nstraight to the start of the canyon.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>First part is promising, some interesting rappels in an interesting\nrock, with 1-2 Possible jumps. But afterwards it's just a huge mess of\nboulders. At the very End there are another 3-4 rappels, but this is not\nenough to make it up for the downclimbs.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>Just a few meters to walk along the riverbed.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n<p>Because of the many boulders, this canyon had to wait until november\n2021 to be explored. Probably won't be repeated anytime soon.</p>\n"
