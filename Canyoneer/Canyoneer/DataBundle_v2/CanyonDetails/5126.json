The narrows are not deep or committing. Exits and anchor options are abundant. Many of the rappels have small steps and tiers, which make for good practice negotiating edges in flowing water. This could be a good low-commitment canyon to practice new techniques and get out with new partners. Spruce Creek is not a destination canyon, but some fun can be had in the right water levels.\n<\/p><p>The final rappel is Continental Falls, a short falls which is a popular hiking destination for Breckenridge hikers\/tourists.\n<\/p><p>Old mining equipment can still be found in parts of the canyon hikers can't access or see from the rim.\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p><b>Driving:<\/b> Head South on Highway 9 from Breckenridge, Colorado.
