  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>Named after the birds that nest in the walls of the cave and at 370\nmeter (1,214 ft) deep, this is one of the largest known cave shaft in\nthe world. This legendary pit is large enough to completely swallow the\nEmpire State Building. In recent years an increasing environmental\nawareness by the Mexican institutions have produced a strict set of\nrules for cavers who want to access this cave, so make sure you read the\n\"Red tape\" section.</p>\n<p>Cayo Cesario Cedillo is the most experienced caver guide in the area.\nHe has dropped Golondrinas more than anyone else alive and has has good\nknowledge of the other caves in the region. Cayo does not speak English,\ndoes not have a phone or use email, but he can be reached on <a\nhref=\"https://www.facebook.com/cesario.cedillo\">facebook Cayo Facebook\nPage</a>. Cayo also manages the official Golondrinas facebook page and\ncan be contacted there as well: <a\nhref=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/S%C3%B3tano-de-las-Golondrinas/185510024862422\">Golondrinas\nFacebook Page</a></p>\n<p>A few recommendations for dropping Golondrinas:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Time to go: Best time to go is between November and March. Avoid\nApril to July, when Golondrinas is closed to cavers. Avoid weekends and\nmajor holidays, when is packed with tourists.</li>\n<li>Lodging: Stay overnight in Aquismon (40 minutes drive) or even\nbetter stay at the Golondrinas Barrio (next to the cave), where they\noffer rooms with bathroom and no need for A/C (up in the\nmountains).</li>\n<li>Rope: 11m or 12mm caving ropes are preferable. Using two 600ft ropes\nis possible but not very fun, as you will have to pass a knot 600ft off\nthe ground and the weight of the rope (usually 40lbs or 20Kg) will make\nthis very difficult. You may prefer to get a single 1200ft rope, that\nwill weight around 80lbs (40kg) and can cost US $50 - $150 to fly on\nmajor airlines. Alternatively, you can also rent a 1200ft rope from\nlocal guides Brigido &amp; Antenogenes ($1500 Pesos in 2015).</li>\n<li>Descenders: A full rack is recommended, any other descender will get\ntoo hot and melt the rope. Start with 4 bars and add more as you go. It\ntakes 20-30 minutes to rappel to the bottom. Some recommend to bring a\nspray bottle to cool off the device, but it is usually not needed if you\ngo with a 6 bar rack at a steady moderate speed.</li>\n<li>Ascenders: A rope walker is highly recommended. It is worth asking\naround or borrow one from someone in your Caving Club. Extremely fit and\nexperienced cavers might also ascend with a Frog System. Properly\ntrained people will take around 1.5h to ascend the rope. Groups of 4 or\nmore people should practice tandem ascending, 2 people ascending on the\nsame rope taking turns climbing and resting.</li>\n<li>Practice: It is highly recommended to practice descending/ascending\nwell in advance and to drop a couple of \"warm up pits\" before attempting\nGolondrinas. <a href=\"Sotano_de_Cepillo\" title=\"wikilink\">Sotano de\nCepillo</a> and <a href=\"Hoya_de_las_Guaguas\" title=\"wikilink\">Hoya de\nlas Guaguas</a> are great pits in the same area that can provide a good\nwarm up.</li>\n<li>Full Service: For a fee ($4000 pesos in 2015) Brigido and\nAntenogenes will lower you down all the way to the bottom and bring you\nback up. No need for specialized gear or prior experience. Cavers that\nare not sure about their ascending capabilities may consider rappeling\ndown on their own but hire their services to pull them up.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Contacts:\n<ul>\n<li>Aquismon Tourist Office Tel: +52 482 367 2115</li>\n<li>Golondrinas Kiosk Tel: +52 469 751 3503</li>\n<li>Cayo Cesario Cedillo (Guide) <a\nhref=\"https://www.facebook.com/cesario.cedillo\">https://www.facebook.com/cesario.cedillo</a></li>\n<li>Antenogenes Perez (Guide) Tel: +52 482 110 9529</li>\n<li>Bonifacio (Guide) Tel: +52 482 106 4988</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you want the thrill of descending to the bottom of the pit and\nback out without the effort of ascending the rope or the accomplishment\nof rigging it on your own, the locals will lower you on a rope and pull\nyou back up all the way for a fee (~4500 pesos, ~$225US in 2022).</p>\n<p>It is also a popular tourist activity to view the birds leave the\ncave en masse at sunrise. Close to 2 million birds live on the sides of\nthe cave and leave together, spiraling up the shaft to gain altitude\nbefore cresting the surface. Note: they won't come out if it is raining,\ncloudy, or even too cold (100 pesos in 2022).</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>The road from Aquismon to the Golondrinas is paved all the way. A\nkiosk charges a fee (30 Pesos in 2015) to access the trail to the top of\nthe pit. Cavers that want to drop the pit will be charged extra.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>Start the approach hike to the cave early in the morning and start\nsetting up rope as soon as you arrive to the cave. Enjoy the show of the\nbirds exiting the cave and as soon as they are done drop down the pit.\nAs soon as last person in the group is down have people start climbing\nback up, preferably in tandem.</p>\n<p>If the birds start coming back before all of you are out, pull up the\nrope and wait till sunset. After all birds are back drop down the rope\nagain and get everyone out. You can climb all night long if you need\nto.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<p>In order to protect the birds, the Mexican Government has mandated\nthat:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Access to cavers is forbidden during swallow nesting season,\napproximately between March 25th and July 15th.</li>\n<li>Cavers can set up rope but cannot rappel into the pit until the\nbirds have finished exiting the cave, which depends on the weather, but\nusually is between 6:30am and 9am.</li>\n<li>Cavers are not allowed to ascend the rope while the birds are\nreturning to the cave, which depends on the weather, but usually is\nbetween 4:30pm and sunset.</li>\n<li>No rope can be hanging into the pit while the birds are flying in or\nout, they will pull up the rope and wait for the birds to finish before\nsetting it back down</li>\n<li>Cavers that have not come out in time will be trapped at the bottom\nof the pit for a few hours, but will be allowed to resume the ascent\nafter dark</li>\n<li>These rules are strictly enforced by the Golondrinas comitee. Even\noffering a US $5000 bribe will be turned down.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a\nhref=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/S%C3%B3tano-de-las-Golondrinas/185510024862422\">Golondrinas\nFacebook Page (Cayo Cesario Cedillo)</a></li>\n<li><a\nhref=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cave_of_Swallows\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cave_of_Swallows</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.amcs-pubs.org/maps/1843.pdf\">Pit Map</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.amcs-pubs.org/maps/1728.pdf\">Crevice\nMap</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.amcs-pubs.org/maps/1854.pdf\">Pit and Crevice\nMap</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n",
