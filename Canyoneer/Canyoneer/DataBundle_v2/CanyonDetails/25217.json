The first exploration of this canyon was done dropping in much higher than this rappel around 34.29782, -118.29144. However there isn't a whole lot of interest above this and these dry falls are the redeeming feature of this canyon. Dropping in directly above this around_____ is probably more desirable.\n<\/p>\n<ul><li><ul><li>As with all the Big T canyons your help is needed to keep access open. This entire area is still seeing a slow recovery from the old station fire which means lots of invasive plants and overgrowth in general can quickly close off access to these areas and\/or make your time in them miserable. Consider adding a pair of hand shears and\/or small bypass loppers to your gear list when descending these places.<\/li><\/ul><\/li><\/ul>\n<pre><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http:\/\/aggie-horticulture.tamu.edu\/earthkind\/landscape\/proper-pruning-techniques\/\">Educate yourself on how and why<\/a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"http:\/\/ep.yimg.com\/ay\/yhst-136001134851880\/forester-8-1-4-by-pass-pro-forged-pruner-pr7240-3.jpg\">[1]<\/a>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https:\/\/www.nationalforests.org\/who-we-are\/our-impact\/angeles\">BIG TUJUNGA CANYON RESTORATION<\/a>\n<\/pre>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>From Sunland drive east on Big Tujunga Road, park on either side of the road anywhere in the vicinity of 34.2950, -118.2840.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Red_tape\">Red tape<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Beta_sites\">Beta sites<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Background\">Background<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Who is John Galt&#160;??\n<\/p>\n\n\n<\/div>","timeRating":"I","rappelLongestMeters":32,"quality":2,"waterRating":"A","rappelCountMax":4,"shuttleSeconds":null,"version":"59371aa710d33c57668c12244b29e4a7d99dec27a397e69c381c8d0cc9af5a80","url":"https:\/\/ropewiki.com\/Galt%27s_Gulch","technicalRating":3,"longitude":-118.2869,"rappelCountMin":2}
