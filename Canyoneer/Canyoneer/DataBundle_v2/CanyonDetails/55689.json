The route features several back to back rappels through a series of pristine forested terraces before descending a 100 foot crack and ultimately merging with Columbus Canyon for the hike out.\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Skyline Canyon requires a short shuttle. The exit vehicle should be parked in the Devil's Kitchen Picnic Area parking lot. The starting vehicle can be parked anywhere along Rimrock drive near the beginning of the route shown on the map. Use good judgement when parking along Rimrock Drive, the road features several blind corners and canyoneers should take care to park completely off the road. Refer to the map for approximate location, but parking should be fairly easy to locate. From the pull-off the goal should be to reach the North Eastern most point on the cliffs between Red and Columbus. Follow the map closely to find Skyline's entrance. The first rappel is approximately .25 miles from the parking location.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>The first rappel is 140' from a smallish juniper tree at the top of the cliff.\nAfter the first rappel, pull the rope and begin searching for a suitable anchor along the cliff edge. There's only one way to go from here: Down. During the first known descent in November of 2018 the drops were rigged with tubular webbing. If using the same anchors, evaluate the webbing closely. Continue down the cliffs ending the technical section of Skyline by descending down a 100' crack which deposits you slightly west of the drainage for Columbus Canyon. From this point, make your way east into the main drainage of Columbus.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>From the terminus of Skyline, make your way east into lower Columbus. Columbus Canyon has several natural springs and flowing but easily avoidable water can usually be found in the drainage. From this point onward the route follows lower Columbus Canyon through several interesting down climbs with the option of one final rappel in the granite. Most parties should be fine with a hand line for this short last descent. There is a good boulder anchor in the middle of the draw that makes a suitable anchor. After the last rappel continue following Columbus past the confluence with Red. Stay in the draw until you see the monument boundary fence. Pay close attention to the monument boundary here. You want to exit Columbus Canyon up a short embankment on the SOUTH SIDE of the monument boundary. There is a well defined trail that leaves the draw on the north side of the fence, but using this trail will require crossing a barbed wire fence to re-enter the monument. Follow the faint trail through the sage and juniper to the south east until you see the east entrance of the monument ranger station. The goal is to ultimately end up back at the Devil's Kitchen picnic area, and your vehicle. refer to the map for exact route.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Red_tape\">Red tape<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>A Colorado National Monument entrance fee is required to access Skyline Canyon\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Beta_sites\">Beta sites<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media<\/h2><\/div>\n<p><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external free\" href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Zn7yVrcVjZo&amp;t=389s\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Zn7yVrcVjZo&amp;t=389s<\/a>\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Background\">Background<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>First known descent November 2018 by Bill Szasz, Ellis Thompson-Ellis, and Joshua Ellis.

without proper technical gear and familiarity with using natural anchors.\n<\/p>\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nParsed by mw‐api‐ext.codfw.main‐6779cc57fc‐xd2mh\nCached time: 20240914191955\nCache
