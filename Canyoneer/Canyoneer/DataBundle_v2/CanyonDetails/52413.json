{"id":52413,"description":"<div class=\"mw-content-ltr mw-parser-output\" lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><p>This is a very beautiful canyon very close to Manali town. This was first descended by Titlee, a French Canyoneer (I am not sure about the spelling of his name). Later, a group Belgium canyoneers bolted the canyon in 2016.\nGokul, Pravin and Vijay from Indian Canyoneers Association descended on June 24th, 2018.\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>From Manali, we can hire an auto-rikshaw  (aka tuk-tuk ) till Gadherni Village. The approach trai starts at 32.218324, 77.185925 and the trail goes to the North.\n<\/p><p>The trail provided was recorded using a cellphone. Please ignore the outlier points in between; those were due to errors. Apart from that all the major points are correct. All waypoints are also correct.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>The technical section of the canyon starts with three quick successive rappels.\n<\/p><p>Rap 1&#160;: 30ft, 2 bolts on LDC on the rock shelter. The bolts are wierdly placed as the direction of load will try to pull the bolts out of the rock. Since, they are glue in bolts, it is okay to rappel.\n<\/p><p>Rap 2&#160;: 35 ft, 3 bolts on RDC. When there is goodwater flow, the first person should go prepared to clip in to the next bolt (like a re-belay) because, at the thrid rappel, there is a barely space for 1 person to stand.\n<\/p><p>Rap 3&#160;: 130 ft, 2 bolts on RDC. There is a barely enough space for 1 person to stand near the anchor station. So, the first person should approach with preparation to clip in and setup anchor for the next folks in line.\nWhen we descended in late June 2018, the water level was very less and there was a bird nest directly below the bolts. There were 3 babies as well. So, please be careful.\n<\/p><p>From here, there is an escape trail on LDC that will take you back to the approach trail and eventually to the village.\n<\/p><p>Rap 4&#160;: 80 ft, 2 bolts RDC. You will be able to see the escape trail approaching from LDC and will continue to the RDC near the bolts. This rappel can also be downclimbed on LDC near the trees.\n<\/p><p>Rap 5&#160;: 200 ft rappel, huge tree anchor on RDC. Also, there is a single bolt in the middle of the rock for those who prefer that.\nThis rappel may be split into two stages. There are bolts midway over the edge which is hard to see from the top. So, if you are aiming for this, please looking at your shoulder level as you rappel.\n<\/p><p>Rap 6&#160;: 25 ft, single bolt on LDC. Rappel on nice smooth slide-like rappel. The pool at the bottom is not deep enough to slide.\n<\/p><p>Rap 7&#160;: 70 ft, single bolt LDC, awkward start. \n<\/p><p>Rap 8&#160;: 160 ft, 2 bolts on LDC. There are multiple sets of bolts on LDC. Any set can be used depending on water level and pull conditions. This is a very nice and tall sliding rappel (in good water flow).\n<\/p><p>The next 3 rappels are in succession. This is the most beautiful section of this technical problem. You will be rappelling in a chimney kind a waterfalls.\n<\/p><p>Rap 9&#160;: 70 ft, there are bolts on both LDC and RDC. LDC bolts are more fun to rappel but, a little stretch to reach the bolts. This LDC bolts will give you a rappel in water course. When you are in the rappel, you will see another set of old bolts. This will allow you to split this rappel into two; 55 ft   15 ft. Decide according to the rope pull conditions. \n<\/p><p>Rap 10&#160;: 20ft, multiple bolts on both sides. There are pipes connected here that supplies drinking water to the village at the bottom. You dont want to dislodge those pipes. RDC bolt preferred.\n<\/p><p>From here, there is a escape trail to RDC. There might be a trail to the LDC as well. If you don't see a trail to LDC, just stick to the trail on RDC; it is well trodden and maintained.\n<\/p><p>Rap 11&#160;: 80 ft, tree anchor a little off on RDC after climbing down 5 ft. There is also a weirdly placed single bolt in the middle of the water course (over the edge). The bolt was really awkardly placed to reach. Hence we used the tree anchor which will result in a dry rappel.\n<\/p><p>Rap 12&#160;: 230 ft, twin bolts on RDC. This rappel can also be split into 2 if needed. Second set of bolts can be seen on LDC at the end of the first ledge. This is the waterfall that is visible from the road where we park the exit vehicle.\n<\/p><p>After this rappel, there is a short 400 ft walk to the final down climb. You may use a handline for this downclimb or partner capture will also do.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>The Canyon exits on the road at 32.212581, 77.185224.
