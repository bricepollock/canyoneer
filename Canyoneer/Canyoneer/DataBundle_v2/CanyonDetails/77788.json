Help the Australian canyoning community by contributing\ntrack notes to ropewiki.com</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>Typically, there is no natural anchor material for the 2nd abseil -\nthe canyon is bare rock at that point with no pinch-points to wedge a\nstick. A cairn anchor would need to be built. The solution adopted by a\ncouple of parties:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>use a meat-anchor</li>\n<li>the first person down swims the pool below</li>\n<li>then climbs out on the left and is able to make there way back\naround to the canyon rim above the rest of the party</li>\n<li>plenty of trees for an anchor. Throw the rope down to the party\nbelow to abseil from, then re-group</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n<p>On David Noble's sketch map of the Coorongooba area, this section has\nthe words \"Waterfall &amp; canyon in this section\". For Rick Jamieson's\n5th edition of his guidebook, presumably an old photocopied map had been\nsupplied by an anonymous source, Rick must have translated the\ndifficult-to-read words as \"Wagtail canyon\".</p>\n<p>Really, this section is \"Lower Golgotha Canyon\".</p>\n",
