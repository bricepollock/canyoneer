  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>A very short seasonal creek between Mosier and Rowena in the Columbia\nGorge. Memaloose is not a high-quality objective and is best to visit\nvery early in the season when everything else is running high and you\nneed your rappel fix. Very mellow. Fine for beginners. Note that this\ncreek only has flow / run-off in the very early season is dry the rest\nof the year. Going early season is also a good way to evade the poison\noak. Do not expect greatness.</p>\n<p>It's easy to park at the mouth of the creek (I-84 eastbound only) and\ncheck water conditions. Don't bother if there's no water running.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<h3 id=\"directions\">Directions</h3>\n<p>Take I-84 east of Hood River for 8.2mi to the Memaloose Rest Area\n(eastbound exit). Park at the far eastern end of the parking lot.</p>\n<h3 id=\"hike_in\">Hike In</h3>\n<p>From the east end of the rest area locate a paved trail and follow it\neast. Note entertaining signs about poison oak and rattlesnakes. At the\neasternmost point of the paved loop, break off and head east on a faint\ntrail. The trail comes and goes, but generally heads eastward and trends\nsouth. You may need to detour to get around occasional thickets of\npoison oak. Follow through rock meadows about 0.4mi before trending\nsoutheast. Reach a small creek (not the one you're looking for) and\ncross it, heading upstream on the far side. You might intersect an old\nroad grade heading the right direction. Eventually pop out on an actual\nroad that leads into a local rock quarry. Follow the road up to the\ncrest of the hill before breaking off and headin gover to the\npicturesque top of Memaloose Creek. R1 is immediately downstream.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>R1: 25ft. There aren't any good anchors near the lip. Anchored off a\ntree set some 50ft back. Can bypass DCL.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Notable hazards on R1: 1) Remnants of a barb-wire fence is hanging in\nthe water DCL at the top of the falls. Would be good to get some wire\ncutters and get that out of there. 2) Loose rocks on the lip.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>R2: Low angle chute to 15ft drop. Downclimb or rappel.</li>\n<li>R3: 6ft drop. Might be downclimbable, but don't slip. There is a\nsmall natural arch DCR at the bottom of the falls.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Below R3 the creek enters the trees and becomes a little\novergrown.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>R4: 50ft. Anchored off a tree DCR. Need about 90ft of rope to reach\nthe bottom.</li>\n<li>R5: The creek passes over a large rock shelf, then drops 15ft.\nProbably downclimbable, but don't slip. Anchored off a tree DCR.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>At the bottom, pass through a short mossy narrows to a final 6ft\nstep. Downclimb or rappel.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>You've reached the end when the creek plunges into a culvert\nunderneath I-84.</p>\n<p>Climb up the embankment wherever is easiest and pop out on the\nhighway shoulder. If you didn't leave a shuttle car at the mouth of the\ncreek, you'll need to hike west 0.6mi along I-84 back to the rest area.\nIt's possible to thrash your way up the steep slopes DCL of the creek\nmouth, but this can get you into some sketchy terrain and it's not worth\nthe effort. Walking along the highway is safer.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<p>Memaloose Creek is entirely on public land: mix of Memaloose State\nPark, Mt. Hood National Forest, and a land trust held by the Friends of\nthe Columbia Gorge. There are some smatterings of private properly west\nof the creek, so please respect the locals and avoid them.</p>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n<p>Creek was probably first descended by Portland locals.</p>\n<p>\"Memaloose\" is the local Chinook jargon and roughly translates \"Place\nof the Dead.\" It's a somewhat ironic name for a rest area off the\nhighway. The name originates from the island of the same name offshore.\nThe island was one of a number called \"Memaloose\" and were locations\nwhere the local tribes interred their dead. The Army Corps of Engineers\nexhumed all the human remains during the building of Bonneville Dam and\nre-interred them in a mass gravesite near The Dalles, OR.</p>\n<p><a\nhref=\"http://columbiariverimages.com/Regions/Places/memaloose_island.html\">Columbia\nRiver Images - Memaloose Island</a></p>\n",
