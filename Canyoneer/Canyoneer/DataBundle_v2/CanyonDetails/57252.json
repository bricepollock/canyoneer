Go North-East and get to Cooper Hill Dr. Turn Left (North) on San Francisquito Canyon Rd. and drive 6.3 miles to the parking at 34.540057, -118.526402. You can see the last waterfall from the road.\n<\/p><p>Approach:\nA short and fun approach climbing up a creek with seven easy to climb short waterfalls and one more to bypass on the right. From the car, walk East on  San Francisquito Canyon Rd. and turn North into the first canyon you see. Take it to it’s starting point and the Saddle on top where you start the descent. From the saddle there’s a nice view of both the ascending and descending canyons.\n<\/p>\n<style data-mw-deduplicate=\"TemplateStyles:r1062633282\">@media all and (max-width:720px){.mw-parser-output .content .thumb>div:not(.thumbinner){display:flex;justify-content:center;flex-wrap:wrap;align-content:flex-start;flex-direction:column}}body.skin-vector .mw-parser-output div.thumb>div:not(.thumbinner){font-size:94%;text-align:center;overflow:hidden;min-width:100px}body.skin-minerva .mw-parser-output div.thumb>div:not(.thumbinner){margin:0 auto;max-width:100%!important}<\/style> \n<div class=\"thumb tright\">\n<div style=\"display:table;\">\n<span class=\"mw-default-size\" typeof=\"mw:Error mw:File\/Frameless\">\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<link rel=\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\" href=\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1062633282\"> \n<div class=\"thumb tright\">\n<div style=\"display:table;\">\n<span class=\"mw-default-size\" typeof=\"mw:Error mw:File\/Frameless\">\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Hiking down from the saddle, you will quickly get to a 40’ angled drop.
