  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>A short, calm, beginner-friendly canyon, runnable earlier in the year\nthan most canyons in the Sierras, and with enough going on to be\ninteresting. A few rappels, and a number of moderate downclimbs. Fed by\nsnowmelt, was running class B and warm in late May of a low-snow year.\nMay reach class C conditions earlier in the season or in years with more\nsnow, and may dry up later in the season. Waterflow can be estimated\nfrom the tunnel.</p>\n<p>The canyon can be escaped at virtually all points, though some would\nbe sketchy, and most but not all rappels can be bypassed (possibly all\nwith effort).</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>From the town of La Porte take St Louis Rd (forest road 21N13X) until\nthe bridge, where it becomes Port Wine Rd. Cross the bridge and park on\nthe west side. Continue up the road on foot, taking a left at the fork.\nBe careful, the road is popular with OHVers who may not be expecting\nfoot traffic. Roughly a mile from the bridge you’ll see some stone-lined\npaths on the left side of the road. These lead to the historic St. Louis\ncemetery, which is well worth a detour. Immediately after the entrance\nto the cemetery path, turn off of Port Wine Rd onto forest road 21N96B.\nTake this about a quarter mile to where it crosses Sears Ravine.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, the road walk can be avoided and the approach can be\ndone as a shuttle, leaving an exit car at the bridge and driving the\nrest of the way to the beginning of the cemetery path/forest road\n21N96B. There’s space for several cars here, but the road quality\nbetween the turnoff and the bridge is poor (4WD), and the road walk\nisn’t difficult, so it’s likely not worth the hassle of a shuttle. You\ncould also only park at the cemetery and do the road walk as part of the\nexit.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>Rappel heights are approximate.</p>\n<p>If wearing wetsuits, suit up before entering, where the road crosses\nthe canyon. Scramble down either the main drainage or the side drainage\nRDC to the obvious R1, 65ft from tree back 30ishft LDC into a shallow\npool. While the drop itself is only 65ft, the distance from the anchor\nto the bottom is 100ft, a 200ft rope was exactly enough. Some easy\nscrambling takes you to R2, 15ft from tree high LDC. Next is a\ndownclimb, 8ft into a waist-deep pool, with good handholds LDC, or could\nbe rigged as a rappel from another 10 or 15ft higher up. The canyon\nopens up slightly into a two-stage waterfall before bending LDC. The\nfirst stage can be downclimbed, bypassed LDC, or rappelled (25ft) from a\nsmall dead tree LDC. The second stage (R3) is 35ft from a pine RDC into\na chest-deep pool. After a little more scrambling, you’ll arrive shortly\nat R4, 12ft into a shallow pool. This may require some anchor creativity\nor meat anchor + LAPAR partner assist; we used the small boulder in the\nwatercourse with a meat backup. A pretty narrows section follows, with\nmany small splashy downclimbs. Within sight of the main creek, a 10ft\ndrop into a waist deep pool presents an obstacle. This can be bypassed\nLDC, or carefully downclimbed.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>After the canyon empties into Slate Creek, continue downstream,\nfloating if safe and desired. After approximately a mile, the creek will\ntake a U-bend, and the easiest walking path will slightly diverge to the\nright from the immediate creekside. After the U-bend, look for a large\nlog laying across the creek, and a tunnel entrance on the left side.\nCross the log with a shallow water jump if desired. Travel through the\ntunnel, which exits immediately downstream of the bridge and your exit\ncar. If you miss the tunnel you’ll wind up at the bridge anyway, but the\ntunnel is a slight shortcut and more fun. The drop out of the tunnel can\nbe downclimbed on the right and gives an easy reference for Slate Creek\nflow.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<p><a\nhref=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/17n30KgmUYJZSRR3QN7YgY8n1ajLww6AfF7MZNJknVM8/edit?usp=sharing\">May\n2020 trip report and photos</a> by Quinn Shemet</p>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n<p>First descended May 2020 by Carly, Quinn, Niles, and Evan.</p>\n",
