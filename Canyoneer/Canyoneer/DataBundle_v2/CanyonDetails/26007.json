  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>Víðgelmir is Iceland's longest lava tube, located in the\nHallmundarhraun lava field (formed around 900 CE) in west Iceland. The\nformation is around 2 km southeast of Fljótstunga farm in Hvítársíða,\nBorgarfjörður. The roof of the lava tube has collapsed, creating two\nlarge openings near its north end which are the only known entrances.\nVíðgelmir is 1585 m long and the largest part of the cave passage is\n15.8 m high and 16.5 m wide, making it by far the largest of its kind in\nIceland. The cave has a wide entrance but narrows down in some places.\nAn iron gate was installed at the first constriction in 1991 to preserve\nthose of the delicate lava formations or speleothems which hadn't\nalready been destroyed. Evidence of human habitation, probably dating to\nthe Viking Age, has been discovered in the cave and is preserved in the\nNational Museum of Iceland. Long stretches of the cave floor are very\nrough and shouldn't be navigated without a guide. Access and guided\ntours are provided at nearby Fljótstunga or can be arranged from\nReykjavik.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<p>The cave has been protected since 1993 and visitors may only enter\nwith a guide.</p>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.thecave.is/\">Official tour site</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n",
