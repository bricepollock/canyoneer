Deep, dark, and ice cold, this canyon is stunningly beautiful and funnels much of the water from the east side of Goat Rocks, fed primarily by the McCall Glacier and surrounding snow fields. While the McCall is not a large glacier, the river runs high most of the year. September is typically the earliest this canyon is feasible, best paired with a cool, dry spell to minimize the melting water coming off of the glacier, and no recent rain.\n<\/p><p>While the canyon itself is overall very short, it is extremely cold and unforgiving and should only be attempted by experienced groups. Drysuits are strongly recommended. The latter half of the canyon is committing and narrow with no exit points. Hazards include trap pools, rappelling in high flow, extremely cold water, pushy pourovers, slippery rock, murky water where checking pool depth is difficult, and waiting in ice cold pools to rappel due to lack of space to climb out of the pools. It is not recommended to exceed 6 team members as larger groups require more waiting time in the cold.\n<\/p><p>If you think your group may be the first of the season, you could be stranded without an emergency bolt kit. This canyon sees extremely high floods throughout the year, and some anchors have already shown significant damage each season.\n<\/p><p>At 8.3 miles round trip including the canyon, this is a very long day. The approach and exit are overall straightforward, but navigation on the old trail can be difficult, particularly if exiting in the dark, which is likely for most groups (<b>bring headlamps!<\/b>). A very early start is recommended. An average group will take 10-12 hours round trip to complete this canyon in normal conditions.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Park at the Scatter Creek NAC trailhead (46.57644, -121.35793). You will need a NW Forest Pass to park here. There are several primitive campsites at the trailhead for those wanting to camp before and\/or after the canyon.\n<\/p><p>From the trailhead, follow the main trail for 0.2 miles, taking a left at the first obvious fork in the trail. Soon after, cut right off of the main trail and look for a faint footpath among the many fallen trees. Eventually, the old abandoned trail will become more obvious as it skirts along the bottom of the hillside. The old trail is sometimes hard to follow as it was mostly forgotten before the Miriam Creek Fire in 2018. It is now becoming overgrown with wild raspberry, brambles, and plenty of dead fall to hop and scoot over. Keep an eye out for saw cut logs and random hikers tape that folks have left. You will follow this old trail the majority of the approach to the canyon, with some minor ups and downs close to 3,400 FE until the second to last drainage. Towards the end of the You will gradually climb up until you reach 4,100 where you will drop in to the canyon. It is prudent to track your approach using the track on this page to help guide your approach and exit. Be sure to bring a headlamp as many groups finish the exit in the dark.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p><b>DCR = Down Canyon Right<\/b>\n<\/p><p><b>DCL = Down Canyon Left<\/b>\n<\/p><p><br \/>\n<b>R0<\/b>: From the suit up area, rappel 100' from a log from the rim of the canyon into the creek.
