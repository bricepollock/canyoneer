  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>Lunada Canyon runs through Palos Verdes before dropping steeply onto\nthe beach of Lunada Bay through this sandstone canyon. This canyon is\nshort, but offers several small rappels and a wonderful introduction to\nsubstantial anchor challenges. Plan enough anchor materials to\ncompletely rerig this canyon when you visit since the anchors can and\nhave been blown out after significant rainfall. The sandstone walls\noffer no bolting opportunities so it will be necessary to employ rigging\ntechniques like rock cairns or chocks. The canyon is part of a drainage\nsystem that spills out into the bay, and any amount of rainfall nearby\ncan affect the water flow greatly. All of the anchors require soft\nstarts, and the walls of many of the waterfalls are slick with algae and\nwet sandstone.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>Park near Lunada Bay. Walk 90 feet from the road to the drop in\npoint. The drop in point is essentially right under the bridge at the\nintersection.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>The canyon is made from very soft sediment which crumbles easily.\nEven the harder rock is still soft compared to most canyons. Rockfall in\nthe narrow canyon is frequent and potentially hazardous.</p>\n<p>R0: 8' Low head damn, metal fence above makes for an easy rappel of\n17 feet or so. The area above the damn is all concrete and mud so no\nnatural anchors are available.</p>\n<p>R1: Frequent water flow may cause natural anchors to wash away. In\nthe center of the canyon are bits of rebar that stick out of the cement.\nUse one of these pieces of rebar to build an anchor, then later retrieve\nit to avoid investigation by curious community members. Alternatively\ngroups could ghost this anchor. The rappel is about 30 feet to a waist\ndeep pool.</p>\n<p>R2: 15' off a cairn in the watercourse into a somewhat larger pool\n(stay DCR to avoid the deepest part of the pool)</p>\n<p>R3: 40' off rusty bolts to a waist high pool (As of December 2020\nthere are no bolts and there is no pool.</p>\n<p>R4: 20' off a knot chock LDC</p>\n<p>R5: 45' off a large rock cairn (Rusty bolts for a 20' rappel, make\nsure pull path is okay)</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>The exit trail is RDC just as the canyon opens up, but take time to\nenjoy the beach first. There are some interesting rocks to the east and\nan interesting riparian area to the west. Be aware that when the ground\nis wet, the exit hike becomes laden with thick and slippery clay, which\ncan make the hike extremely challenging and treacherous.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<p>See \"Trip reports\" section for further information.</p>\n<p>There aren't any \"no tresspassing\" or \"off limits\" signs, however\nentering the canyon does often catch the attention of members of the\ncommunity walking their dogs by the beach and park nearby. It is\nsuggested you drop into the canyon quickly and in a smallish sized group\nto avoid unwanted attention. Directly across from the canyon exit is a\nclear view of the exit trail, which beach goers use to access the area\nbelow the cliffside.</p>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a\nhref=\"https://www.facebook.com/benjamin.pelletier/media_set?set=a.523769479636\">https://www.facebook.com/benjamin.pelletier/media_set?set=a.523769479636</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>July 12, 2018 P.V.P.D. Arrived as L.A.M.A.R. was about to descend and\ninformed us that we're in violation of an obscure city ordinance that\nprohibits climbing trees, bluffs, canyons, rocks etc... and rappelling.\nApparently there's guy living at the drop who calls the police when he\nnoticies anyone dropping into the drainage.</p>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n",
