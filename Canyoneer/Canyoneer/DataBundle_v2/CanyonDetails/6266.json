This canyon is short, but offers several small rappels and a wonderful introduction to substantial anchor challenges. Plan enough anchor materials to completely rerig this canyon when you visit since the anchors can and have been blown out after significant rainfall. The sandstone walls offer no bolting opportunities so it will be necessary to employ rigging techniques like rock cairns or chocks. The canyon is part of a drainage system that spills out into the bay, and any amount of rainfall nearby can affect the water flow greatly. All of the anchors require soft starts, and the walls of many of the waterfalls are slick with algae and wet sandstone.\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Park near Lunada Bay.  Walk 90 feet from the road to the drop in point. The drop in point is essentially right under the bridge at the intersection.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>The canyon is made from very soft sediment which crumbles easily.  Even the harder rock is still soft compared to most canyons. Rockfall in the narrow canyon is frequent and potentially hazardous.\n<\/p><p>R0: 8' Low head damn, metal fence above makes for an easy rappel of 17 feet or so. The area above the damn is all concrete and mud so no natural anchors are available. \n<\/p><p>R1: Frequent water flow may cause natural anchors to wash away. In the center of the canyon are bits of rebar that stick out of the cement. Use one of these pieces of rebar to build an anchor, then later retrieve it to avoid investigation by curious community members. Alternatively groups could ghost this anchor. The rappel is about 30 feet to a waist deep pool.\n<\/p><p>R2: 15' off a cairn in the watercourse into a somewhat larger pool (stay DCR to avoid the deepest part of the pool)\n<\/p><p>R3: 40' off rusty bolts to a waist high pool (As of December 2020 there are no bolts and there is no pool.\n<\/p><p>R4: 20' off a knot chock LDC\n<\/p><p>R5: 45' off a large rock cairn (Rusty bolts for a 20' rappel, make sure pull path is okay)\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>The exit trail is RDC just as the canyon opens up, but take time to enjoy the beach first.  There are some interesting rocks to the east and an interesting riparian area to the west. Be aware that when the ground is wet, the exit hike becomes laden with thick and slippery clay, which can make the hike extremely challenging and treacherous.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Red_tape\">Red tape<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>See \"Trip reports\" section for further information.\n<\/p><p>There aren't any \"no tresspassing\" or \"off limits\" signs, however entering the canyon does often catch the attention of members of the community walking their dogs by the beach and park nearby. It is suggested you drop into the canyon quickly and in a smallish sized group to avoid unwanted attention. Directly across from the canyon exit is a clear view of the exit trail, which beach goers use to access the area below the cliffside.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Beta_sites\">Beta sites<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media<\/h2><\/div>\n<ul><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external free\" href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/benjamin.pelletier\/media_set?set=a.523769479636\">https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/benjamin.pelletier\/media_set?set=a.523769479636<\/a><\/li><\/ul>\n<p><br \/>\nJuly 12, 2018 P.V.P.D.
