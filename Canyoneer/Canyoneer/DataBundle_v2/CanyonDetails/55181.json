  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>Cueva de la Tia Rosa (also called Tierrosa which is an amalgam of the\nofficial name) is a nice water cave near the start of <a href=\"Chipitin\"\ntitle=\"wikilink\">Chipitin</a> canyon. It is full of water and has\nswimming. Midway through the cave you will reach a point where the water\nreaches the ceiling and it appears the cave ends. However you can do a\nseries of hold-your-breath duck-unders (around 3 or so), and you will\nre-emerge in dry passage and see the second half of the cave which is\nvery nice passageway.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>There are two ways to enter the cave, either walking in through the\nmouth, or doing a 25m rappel down a chimney that will put you a couple\nhundred feet inside.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>Typically after exploring this cave the group will descend <a\nhref=\"Chipitin\" title=\"wikilink\">Chipitin</a> canyon, or you can hike\nback to Potrero Redondo.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n",
