The approach starts on flat ground and faint Deer trails can be followed at first. Follow the creek to the junction with the General. At the junction with The General the terrain gets steeper. There is no real track, but terrain is through open old growth Forrest (the big green monster) and navigation is relatively straight forward. Climb the broken ridge that separates the two catchments. At about the 1000m contour begin climbing down and into he Captain. \n<\/p><p>Below is a link with a rough guide to the approach marked in red\n<\/p>\n<style data-mw-deduplicate=\"TemplateStyles:r1062633282\">@media all and (max-width:720px){.mw-parser-output .content .thumb>div:not(.thumbinner){display:flex;justify-content:center;flex-wrap:wrap;align-content:flex-start;flex-direction:column}}body.skin-vector .mw-parser-output div.thumb>div:not(.thumbinner){font-size:94%;text-align:center;overflow:hidden;min-width:100px}body.skin-minerva .mw-parser-output div.thumb>div:not(.thumbinner){margin:0 auto;max-width:100%!important}<\/style> \n<div class=\"thumb tright\">\n<div style=\"display:table;\">\n<div class=\"thumbcaption\" style=\"display:table-caption;caption-side:bottom;box-sizing:border-box;\">{{{caption}}} <\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Captain Chaos has short interesting sections of narrow slot, generally with abseils, followed by open boulder walking sections.\nIt is a very low flow canyon which makes it ideal for descent when others in the area are flowing too high, or you are uncomfortable with higher flow canyons but are looking to put your rope skills into action in a canyon environment.   \n<\/p><p>There is plenty of opportunity for escape throughout the canyon. \nAs this is a fairly easy descent, no Canyon Topo is provided. \n2x 60m Ropes will be plenty to get you through.\nThe canyon has a combination of blots and natural anchors. \nThere are only a few locations where bolts are 100% required and if care is taken prior to committing to any one section, it is *almost* always possible to back-track to a point in the canyon where you are able to escape.  \nHaving said that, I still recommend carrying a emergency bolting kit and definitely carry some sling\/webbing to replace natural anchors.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>the canyon finishes at The General jctn, retrace your steps back to the car.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Red_tape\">Red tape<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Beta_sites\">Beta sites<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Background\">Background<\/h2><\/div>\n\n\n<\/div>","vehicle":null,"id":32855}
