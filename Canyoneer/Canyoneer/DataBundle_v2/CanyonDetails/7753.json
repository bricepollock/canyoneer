  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>These mines are private property and you must obtain permission from\nthe owner to visit. Please see the Red Tape section for information.</p>\n<p>The Tecopa Mines make for excellent abandoned mine exploring. You can\nexplore for just a few hours, or take the several days necessary to\nfully explore them.</p>\n<p>The Tecopa mining district is full of excellent abandoned mines to\nexplore and other nearby mines and mining districts.</p>\n<p>The town of Tecopa sits on several developed Hot Spring facilities,\nand there is still an undeveloped location for those wishing less\nestablished soaking. Nearby China Ranch Date Farm can also make an\nenjoyable sidetrip visit for dates and a hike along the river.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>Access generally just involves driving up to the various mines\nportals, typically the Eastern portal of the War Eagle. You will want a\nhigh clearance 4x4 to explore the area however the eastern portal can be\nobtained in most 2wd sedans or even an RV.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>These are some of the largest abandoned mines in the Southwest with\nmiles of underground workings that connect to different mines.</p>\n<p>Most routes require just scrambling and climbing ladders, but routes\nto access the deepest most remote areas will require technical gear and\nskills to rappel and ascend rope.</p>\n<p>These mines have some dangerous crumbly ceiling, with dynamite sticks\nout in the middle of walking passage, so extreme caution is advised if\nentering the mines.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<p>The mines are privately owned historical sites and the owner has been\nworking hard since 2021 to maintain the mines for future generations. In\nthe past the mines have been publicly accessible and thus subject to\nvandalism and many important artifacts were stolen.</p>\n<p>It goes without saying that abandoned mines are very dangerous, you\nwill entering at your own risk, and with permission of the owner\nonly.</p>\n<p>If you're interested in serious and technical mine exploring, join an\nexperienced group such as the <a\nhref=\"http://www.southerncaliforniagrotto.com/\">SoCal Grotto</a>, <a\nhref=\"http://desertdogs.org/\">Desert Dogs</a>, or the <a\nhref=\"http://www.undergroundexplorers.com/\">Underground Explorers</a>.\nThese groups occasionally arrange visits and are your best bet for\nexploring the area safely.</p>\n<p>Please, we implore you fair adventurer, join a group which has\npermission for their trip, or seek permission from the owner to show\nthat we respect his site and will also protect it for future\ngenerations.
