  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>As the Glacier is shrinking, this insane canyon became more and more\nvisible. Made of two parts, with the first one still below the glacier,\nthis descent is one of the most technical of the alps in terms of\ncombining mountain activities, as the approach is made on the glacier\nitself.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>The parking is far away, there is an alpine taxi though which can get\nyou up, but even from there it is still a long way to the Hüfihütte.\nThere are already some rappels to do, in aim to reach the glacier. Once\nyou've crossed that one, you'll need to find a spot where it is possible\nto abseil below the ice to the start of the canyon.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>First rappels are still below the glacier, then it gets completely\ndark before being spit out on a 30m Waterfall. There is about one km to\nwalk until you'll reach the last section of this canyon, where another\nnarrow part with 7 rappels awaits you.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>Follow the river until you reach a hiking path.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<p>Picture credit : Matthias Holzinger</p>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n",
