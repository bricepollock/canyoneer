  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>A fun little canyon with beautiful views, striking sandstone\nformations and some fun rappels.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>Walk up the trail towards La Ventana arch looking for use trail that\nleaves it to skirt around the cliffs to the right. Follow this around,\nstaying close-ish to the cliffs. Upon reaching the slickrock find the\neasiest way up onto it then work your way up while staying fairly close\nto the cliffs on the left side. Look for a cairn towards the top. From\nhere, go straight up towards the overhung cliff band directly above you.\nLooking right you will see a short crack that is the easiest way up. Two\neasy class 5 moves will get someone up and a handline can be set for the\nless confident climbers.</p>\n<p>Ascending the gully on the other side of this draw would be slower,\nmuch easier and probably preferable if there isn't at least one strong\nclimber in the group.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>R1: 80' juniper LDC</p>\n<p>R2 optional: 25' pinch RDC or downclimb through the rabbit-hole in\nthe center of the boulder wedgery</p>\n<p>R3: 15' pinch canyon center</p>\n<p>R4 optional: 45' off a pinch point canyon center or a 15' elevator\ndownclimb followed by controlled 8' slide/LAPAR</p>\n<p>Then downclimb in crack LDC or center</p>\n<p>R5: 65' tree RDC or somewhat exposed downclimb further RDC</p>\n<p>After this, stay RDC on ledge to exit or handline down 10' drop\nLDC</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>Follow the wash out till you can exit left and find the path of least\nresistance back to the parking lot</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<p><a\nhref=\"http://www.dougscottart.com/hobbies/SlotCanyons/PaintedArch.htm\">http://www.dougscottart.com/hobbies/SlotCanyons/PaintedArch.htm</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n",
