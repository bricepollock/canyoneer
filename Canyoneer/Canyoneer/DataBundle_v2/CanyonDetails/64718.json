You have to either pay someone with a truck to drive you up and drop you off or, if you have two vehicles (sedans probably won't work) go back and get your car at the end (~45 mins to the drop-in). The approach hike is a few minutes.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>R1: bolts LDC, mostly dry\n<\/p><p>R2: tree LDC. best rappel of the canyon, dropping you into the flow. There are some chunks of tires affixed to the rock to protect against abrasion. These work best if all but the last runs the rope through a biner on a little sapling a few feet down from the anchor. Can be jumped by the brave.\n<\/p><p>R3 (optional): bolts on both sides but easy to to down limb RDC in normal flow.\n<\/p><p>R4 (optional). An easy jump but best to send someone down to check rock locations unless you're there with someone who knows\n<\/p><p>3 sections of narrows after this have lots of swimming but  are not very technical.
