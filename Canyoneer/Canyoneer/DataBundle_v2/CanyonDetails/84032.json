  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>We call this canyon Black Magic for its moments of magic, especially\nthe big drop. The canyon terrain before the big drop appeared to be more\nscenic on a map but it turned out to be a series of bypassable\ndownclimbs in a somewhat open gorge. Plus we also want to keep the theme\nwith thee Black range, so \"Black Magic\" fit well. This would be a 2 1/2\nstar canyon if it was not for the scenic big drop. When you combine this\ncanyon with Black Jack canyon, float down to AZ springs and out, we\nfound the day to be a 5 star day, and called it Black Jack Magic.</p>\n<p>Please, remember that installation of permanent fixed hardware is\nprohibited in Lake Mead National Recreation Area. No bolts.</p>\n<p>Do not enter this canyon if you do not have the knowledge to entirely\ninspect and replace anchorage. Do not assume anchorage is prepared to\nhold any load bearing weight upon your arrival. Bring anchorage\nreplacement material and be prepared to replace all anchorage. This\ncanyon floods and becomes hot. The sunbaked and worn webbing can break.\nInspect and Replace all anchorage in this canyon.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>Easy gradual downhill approach into the canyon.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>We ghosted the first rap which was around 70 ft in length. We\nrecommend future visitors do the same since this is near a hiking trail.\nWe found most of the higher angle sections bypassable until we\napproached the big drop. The rap before the big drop is about 20ft and\nis also downclimable. The big rap is quite impressive and gives you a\nperspective of the river that is not found in any other canyons in this\nregion. We threw over a 330 ft rope and found that we had about 10 feet\nof rope to spare. After the big drop you have one more nice drop to the\nriver which is around 40 ft. inflate your pack rafts and float to your\ndesired exit.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>You have numerous exits to choose from. Eventually we floated down\nand exited from White Rock but our trip was just getting started. We\nfloated down to a break where we can access numerous canyons back up on\nthe west rim. We exited the river, accessed Black Jack Canyon, and\nfloated down to white rock for the hike out. We call this duo \"Black\nJack Magic\". A 5 star \"magical\" day on the black range.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<p>You must wear an approved USCG PFD and have a water craft suitable\nfor floating down the river.</p>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<p><a\nhref=\"https://adamhaydock.blogspot.com/2024/01/black-magic-canyon.html\">EVEN-FURTHER,\nBLACK MAGIC</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n<p>We found webbing in this canyon so this is not a first descent but a\ndocumented descent of an unpublished canyon. It will be great to know\nsome more oof the history behind this canyon.</p>\n<p>This canyon was originally named Shoot to Thrill Canyon in early\n2023. The big drop indeed gives some nice thrills.</p>\n",
