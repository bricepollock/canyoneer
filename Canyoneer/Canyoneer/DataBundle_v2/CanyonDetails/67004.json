  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>Clemmons Hollow is a fun one-off rappel (for now) accessible from\nKyle's Landing and great to do in the morning or evening. It's believed\nthat all of Clemmons Hollow could be a fun descent but has not be\nscouted.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>To get to the rappel (the end of the canyon), hike a flat section of\nthe BRT similar to the approach to <a href=\"Cecil_Hollow\"\ntitle=\"wikilink\">Cecil Hollow</a> but continue straight instead of\nturning uphill. Pass an old farmhouse and then you'll hit the creek.\nFollow the trail upstream past \"Living History\" signs and there is a\ntrail that goes to the top of the cliff.</p>\n<p>I believe that you could get to the top of Clemmons Hollow to descend\nthe whole thing by using the <a href=\"Cecil_Hollow\"\ntitle=\"wikilink\">Cecil Hollow</a> approach but turning right on Bench\nTrail instead.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>Right now it's just an 80 ft. rappel but the whole hollow may be able\nto be descended.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>Exit on the same trail you came in.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n",
