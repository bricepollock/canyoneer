  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p><b>Gold Mountain Via Ferrata</b> is the most vertical and\nEuropean-style Via Ferrata in the Ouray and Telluride region. It climbs\n1200 feet straight up the sandstone dihedrals, overhangs, and ledges of\nprivately-owned Gold Mountain. Highlights include the path routing\nthrough an old mine tunnel with mine cart tracks for the Memphis Mine\nand buildings used over a hundred years ago. The route splits briefly\nbetween an easy and hard path to access the start of the mine tunnel.\nThose who have done via ferratas in Europe will appreciate the exposure\nof more strenuous path.</p>\n<p>The construction places abundant rungs and well-looped cables right\nwhere they are wanted.</p>\n<p>Unlike the other two nearby via ferratas on National Forest\nLand:<br />\n* <a\nhref=\"https://ropewiki.com/Telluride_Via_Ferrata_(Krogeratta)\">https://ropewiki.com/Telluride_Via_Ferrata_(Krogeratta)</a>\nand<br />\n* <a\nhref=\"https://ropewiki.com/Ouray_Via_Ferrata\">https://ropewiki.com/Ouray_Via_Ferrata</a><br />\nthe <b>Gold Mountain Via Ferrata</b> is on private land and its\nconstruction was funded by commercial and private parties.
