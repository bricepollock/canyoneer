  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>(SCOTT SWANEY) - PUT ON MY MAP AS A REFERENCE CANYON. MAINLY A HIKING\nCANYON WITH ONE 20' DRYFALL TO CLIMB OVER. BUT PUT HERE BECAUSE OF TWO\nOTHER UPPER CANYON FORKS I COMPLETED THAT DRAIN INTO THIS CANYON. IT IS\nSTILL A VERY PRETTY CANYON TO GET INTO. By getting into this canyon, you\nhave to get up a 20' high chockstone that blocks the hiking route up. It\nwould have a 5th Class climbing rating to climb up it. People have\nbrought ladders in there, put knotted rope up, etc., to be able to get\nup the canyon.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>There is one 20' dry-fall near the mouth that would be considered a\nrappel, or a sketchy down-climb. For that one drop I think the canyon\nshould carry a Class 3 rating even if that is the only technical falls\nin the main canyon. If people saw it as a Class 2 canyon. and went\nunprepared, there could be an accident. I have been thru there three\ntimes, and each time something different has been brought in there by\nhikers such as a wooden ladder, a knotted rope to climb &amp; descend\non, and webbing set for a rappel anchor. Many hikers do go up this\ncanyon, and most try to get over this obstacle without much of a bypass\noption available.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><img src=\"rwl_en.png\" title=\"rwl_en.png\" alt=\"rwl_en.png\" /><a\nhref=\"http://hikearizona.com/decoder.php?ZTN=3167\">HikeArizona.com</a> :\nRed Wall Canyon - DVNP</li>\n<li><img src=\"rwl_en.png\" title=\"rwl_en.png\" alt=\"rwl_en.png\" /><a\nhref=\"http://americansouthwest.net/slot_canyons/red_wall/canyon.html\">AmericanSouthwest.net</a>\n: Red Wall Canyon</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n<p>Originally explored by <a href=\"User:Scott_Swaney\"\ntitle=\"wikilink\">Scott Swaney</a> on 2013-03-11 under the identifier\n\"G\".
