MAINLY A HIKING CANYON WITH ONE 20' DRYFALL TO CLIMB OVER. BUT PUT HERE BECAUSE OF TWO OTHER UPPER CANYON FORKS I COMPLETED THAT DRAIN INTO THIS CANYON. IT IS STILL A VERY PRETTY CANYON TO GET INTO. By getting into this canyon, you have to get up a 20' high chockstone that blocks the hiking route up. It would have a 5th Class climbing rating to climb up it. People have brought ladders in there, put knotted  rope up, etc., to be able to get up the canyon.\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>There is one 20' dry-fall near the mouth that would be considered a rappel, or a sketchy down-climb. For that one drop I think the canyon should carry a Class 3 rating even if that is the only technical falls in the main canyon. If people saw it as a Class 2 canyon. and went unprepared, there could be an accident. I have been thru there three times, and each time something different has been brought in there by hikers such as a wooden ladder, a knotted rope to climb &amp; descend on, and webbing set for a rappel anchor. Many hikers do go up this canyon, and most try to get over this obstacle without much of a bypass option available.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Red_tape\">Red tape<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Beta_sites\">Beta sites<\/h2><\/div>\n<ul><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http:\/\/hikearizona.com\/decoder.php?ZTN=3167\">HikeArizona.com<\/a> &#160;: Red Wall Canyon - DVNP<\/li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http:\/\/americansouthwest.net\/slot_canyons\/red_wall\/canyon.html\">AmericanSouthwest.net<\/a> &#160;: Red Wall Canyon<\/li><\/ul>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Background\">Background<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Originally explored by <a href=\"\/w\/index.php?title=User:Scott_Swaney&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"User:Scott Swaney (page does not exist)\">Scott Swaney<\/a> on 2013-03-11 under the identifier \"G\".
