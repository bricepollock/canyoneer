The track begins to climb up steadily, before turning left up a gully. Once up the steepest part a signpost points to a lookout which provides a stunning view.\n<\/p><p>Continue along the track to the watershed where it begins the downhill journey towards Glen Davis. Turn right here, passing a NPWS sign about Starlight Canyon. This track heads north, then north east, then east. Leave the track and head south over the highpoint at 455 278. Continue south along this ridge for about 600m. From the next highpoint, head south east down a spur until the ridge flattens out. From here you turn south west (right) and drip into the gully.\n<\/p><p><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http:\/\/ozultimate.com\/canyoning\/maps\/wolgan_canyons.pdf%7CTom\">Brennan's \/ OzUltimate Wolgan Canyons map<\/a>\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Nightmare is very vertical with lots of diverse abseils.
