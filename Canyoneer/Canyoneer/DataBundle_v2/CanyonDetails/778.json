Combine with the short narrows of nearby Tunnel Canyon to fill out the day.  Being so scenic and non-technical (and not terribly far from the city of Escalante) means that the Zebra Canyon narrows are a fairly popular venue.  Get there early to get the place to yourself.\nRope work is required to overcome the massive keeper pothole at the head of the canyon if you are a completionist doing the through hike. Everything can be ascended without ropes except the final pothole. If doing the through hike starting at the bottom you will need to set a rope first off a small wiry bush high on canyon left and leave it as a fixed rope is needed to escape the top massive keeper pothole.\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Park immediately past the cattle guard. From the parking lot, cross the road (NE) to the well travelled trail and hike this about 2mi to a wide wash. At the wash turn left (north) to head to Zebra or right (south) to head to Tunnel.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>The normal route has you navigating your way up canyon through a beautifully sculpted slot which terminates at a deep pothole. To exit out the top of the canyon will require either pre-rigged rope from the top or very good pothole escape techniques.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2
