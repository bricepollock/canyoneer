  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>Not a \"Canyon\", just a big 300' free-hang rappel into Big Tujunga\nCanyon.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><ul>\n<li>As with all the Big T canyons your help is needed to keep access\nopen. This entire area is still seeing a slow recovery from the old\nstation fire which means lots of invasive plants and overgrowth in\ngeneral can quickly close off access to these areas and/or make your\ntime in them miserable. Consider adding a pair of hand shears and/or\nsmall bypass loppers to your gear list when descending these\nplaces.</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul>\n<p><a\nhref=\"http://aggie-horticulture.tamu.edu/earthkind/landscape/proper-pruning-techniques/\"><code>Educate yourself on how and why</code></a><code>Â </code><a\nhref=\"http://ep.yimg.com/ay/yhst-136001134851880/forester-8-1-4-by-pass-pro-forged-pruner-pr7240-3.jpg\"><code>1</code></a><br />\n<a\nhref=\"https://www.nationalforests.org/who-we-are/our-impact/angeles\"><code>BIG TUJUNGA CANYON RESTORATION</code></a></p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>Park at the gravel parking lot used for Fall Creek, Classic Canyon,\nFox Creek etc., and walk down FS road 3N27. This rappel is just before\nyou reach the point on the fire road where you can see any of Classic\nCanyon. It is the furthest west that the fire road reaches from the\ntrailhead to Big Tujunga Creek. The drop-in is at UTM 11S 392561.90 E\n3796283.31 N</p>\n<p>Below is a picture of how it appeared in Sept 2014, I put the cairn\nvisible near the center of the picture there. In the foreground of the\nphoto is a wooden mining claim stick. Don't expect either of these\nfeatures to necessarily be present when you are there.</p>\n<figure>\n<img src=\"BigTJ1.jpg\" title=\"BigTJ1.jpg\" />\n<figcaption>BigTJ1.jpg</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>As of April 2020, there is a large X on the ground at the drop-in,\nproviding an excellent visual marker for the correct location.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>There are bushes to anchor off of just past (downhill of) the cairn.\nIf you anchor from the very top it is about 90' of rope needed to get to\nyour main anchor, which is a big/tall pine tree, 2' diameter and about\n30'(?) tall. I was able to down-climb on the center/left(south) of the\ncairn to within about 20' of the tree, but there is LOTS of loose scree\nand rocks with a 300'+ fall if you slip. If you proceed directly toward\nthe tree anchor from the edge of the trail, you will find suitable\nanchor bushes.</p>\n<p>The following photo is a profile view of the top part of the rappel\nshowing the drop-in and tree anchor. The photo was taken from the gravel\nroad just uphill (south) of the drop-in.</p>\n<figure>\n<img src=\"BigTJ2.jpg\" title=\"BigTJ2.jpg\" />\n<figcaption>BigTJ2.jpg</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>This photo is from the tree anchor looking down. From the tree anchor\nto the ground it is about 305'. It is about 30' to the small bench in\nthe photo, the rappel becomes free-hanging after this point, about 270'.\nIf it has been some time since the last descent, there may be\nsubstantial amounts of loose rock at this location. Make sure to\ndislodge these rocks before beginning the rappel.</p>\n<figure>\n<img src=\"BigTJ3.jpg\" title=\"BigTJ3.jpg\" />\n<figcaption>BigTJ3.jpg</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>I would recommend waiting to throw your rope bag until you reach this\npoint to avoid getting it tangled in some tall trees at the bottom.\nThere are a lot of loose rocks and scree above this rappel, rock-fall on\nthis rappel is a serious consideration.</p>\n<p>The following photo was taken from across Big TJ canyon from the fall\ncreek fire road:</p>\n<figure>\n<img src=\"BigTJFreehang6.jpg\" title=\"BigTJFreehang6.jpg\" />\n<figcaption>BigTJFreehang6.jpg</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>Option one: Ascend back up your rope(s). If you choose this option,\nyou may want to put an edge protector on your rope where it goes over\nthe small bench below the tree anchor.</p>\n<p>Option two: From the bottom of the rappel, walk downhill to Big\nTujunga Creek and follow it upstream (right turn/N-NE) to the gravel\nroad you walked in on.</p>\n<p>Option three: Fix several ropes in a prominent wash/chute just to the\nN/NE (&lt;100' past the rappel drop-in point, further down the fire road\nwalking toward Classic Canyon) and ascend these ropes back to the fire\nroad. (A 220' + 100' will suffice. 100' will get you from the road to\nthe pour-over of the chute, 220' will get you to the ground) In the\nfollowing photo, taken from across canyon on the fire road, the blue\nline indicates where the fixed lines would go:</p>\n<figure>\n<img src=\"BigTJ11.jpg\" title=\"BigTJ11.jpg\" />\n<figcaption>BigTJ11.jpg</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n<p>HUGE rock-fall potential on this rappel, be very careful not to kick\nany rocks down on the person on rappel.
