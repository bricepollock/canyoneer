  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>Ape Cave is the third longest contiguous lava tube (2.5mi long) in\nthe North America. Located at the base of Mount Saint Helen, the cave is\nbroken in two sections:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Lower Ape Cave: 1.5 miles roundtrip, easy walking, good for\nfamilies, in and out the same way</li>\n<li>Upper Ape Cave: 3 miles roundtrip, more challenging with several\nclimbs, option to return by surface trail</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Ape Cave is extremely popular on weekends, particularly the lower\nsection. The Forest Service administers Ape Caves as a public\nattraction, consequently you're likely to find many underprepared or new\ncavers as well as trash and inappropriate behavior. This might be a good\nopportunity for some friendly education. The cave is fabulously long;\neven experienced cavers might enjoy the experience. Come mid-week or in\nwinter for more solitude. The main Ape Cave Parking lot is generally\nclosed in the winter season, so you'll need to park at the nearby Trail\nof Two Forests and hike or snowshoe in. (Update: cave may have been\ngated which makes winter entry impossible.)</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>From the parking area, you have two choices:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Enter the cave directly via the sinkhole and metal ladder. (This is\nthe easiest way to the lower portion of the cave.)</li>\n<li>Follow a well-maintained trail about 1mi to the upper entrance. You\ncan then descend through the cave to the main entrance. This trail may\nbe harder to follow in winter.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>The caves are touristic but non-commercial, so bring several light\nsources, gloves, and a helmet. Its advantageous to bring a powerful\nlight. The dark lava absorbs more light than light-colored limestone\ncaves.</p>\n<p>Be prepared for cold, the cave stays at constant temperature of 42F\neven in summer.</p>\n<p>You have to climb a few small lava waterfalls in Upper Ape Cave. They\nare fun, and the lava provides good footing, but can be difficult for\nsmall children.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>Follow a trail marked with blue markers to come back from Upper. Or\nyou can just go back underground.</p>\n<p>The lower portion of the cave is a dead end, so it's an out &amp;\nback from the main entrance.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<p>As of 2021, Ape Cave now requires <a\nhref=\"https://www.recreation.gov/timed-entry/10086990\">a reservation fee\nwith a timed entry</a>. Additionally, a NW Forest Pass is required to\npark at the trailhead. Park 0.25mi away and you don't need a pass.\n(Trail of Two Forests also requires a NW Forest Pass.)</p>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a\nhref=\"https://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/giffordpinchot/recarea/?recid=40393\">https://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/giffordpinchot/recarea/?recid=40393</a></li>\n<li><a\nhref=\"http://www.portlandhikersfieldguide.org/wiki/Ape_Cave_Hike\">http://www.portlandhikersfieldguide.org/wiki/Ape_Cave_Hike</a></li>\n<li><img src=\"rwl_en.png\" title=\"rwl_en.png\" alt=\"rwl_en.png\" /><a\nhref=\"http://hikearizona.com/decoder.php?ZTN=3346\">HikeArizona.com</a> :\nApe Cave</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n<p>Cave gets its name from the reports of Sasquatch in the area.</p>\n",
