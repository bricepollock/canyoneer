I remember visiting it from below\nafter my first trip down Midwinter Canyon - back sometime in the\nearly/mid eighties. On that trip - we went up it from below - climbing\nup ledges and roots and almost reaching the top. Now on that trip were\nRoger and Nipper who were on the trip that found Midwinter Canyon - and\nI don't think they had seen it before. So I assume our name \"Short\nCanyon\" is the earliest name for the canyon. Anyway - I know a fair\nnumber of people that canyon in that area - and that is the name they\nseem to use for it.</p>\n",
