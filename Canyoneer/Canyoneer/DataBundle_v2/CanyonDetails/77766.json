I remember visiting it from below after my first trip down Midwinter Canyon - back sometime in the early\/mid eighties. On that trip - we went up it from below - climbing up ledges and roots and almost reaching the top. Now on that trip were Roger and Nipper who were on the trip that found Midwinter Canyon - and I don't think they had seen it before. So I assume our name \"Short Canyon\" is the earliest name for the canyon. Anyway - I know a fair number of people that canyon in that area - and that is the name they seem to use for it.\n<\/p>\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nParsed by mw‐api‐ext.codfw.main‐6779cc57fc‐m8c98\nCached time: 20240914191911\nCache expiry: 2592000\nReduced expiry: false\nComplications: [show‐toc]\nCPU time usage: 0.007 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.008 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 21\/1000000\nPost‐expand include size: 0\/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 0\/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 2\/100\nExpensive parser function count: 0\/500\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0\/20\nUnstrip post‐expand size: 0\/5000000 bytes\nNumber of Wikibase entities loaded: 0\/400\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%    0.000      1 -total\n-->\n<\/div>","rappelCountMin":null,"rappelLongestMeters":null}
