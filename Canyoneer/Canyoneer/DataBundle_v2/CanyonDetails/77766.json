I remember visiting it from below after my first trip down Midwinter Canyon - back sometime in the early\/mid eighties. On that trip - we went up it from below - climbing up ledges and roots and almost reaching the top. Now on that trip were Roger and Nipper who were on the trip that found Midwinter Canyon - and I don't think they had seen it before. So I assume our name \"Short Canyon\" is the earliest name for the canyon. Anyway - I know a fair number of people that canyon in that area - and that is the name they seem to use for it.\n<\/p>\n\n\n<\/div>","longitude":150.2853,"waterRating":null,"technicalRating":null,"name":"Greenup","url":"https:\/\/ropewiki.com\/Greenup","rappelCountMax":null,"months":["Oct","Nov","Dec","Jan","Feb","Mar","Apr"],"rappelLongestMeters":null,"vehicle":null,"shuttleSeconds":null,"id":77766}
