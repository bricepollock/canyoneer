Although short, this canyon makes up for it with memorable rappels, a multitude of jumps ranging from 10 feet to 90 feet, clear water, amazingly deep pools, good afternoon sunshine and if you dare, a 40 foot slide that rivals any other in Washington.\n<\/p><p><b>Please be very aware of the high profile nature of the area.<\/b>\n<\/p><p>The canyon is within a Washington State Park, a highly managed area of land. On a sunny summer weekend, hundreds of tourists will visit the falls. For large sections anyone canyoning will be highly visible. Our access to descend Twin Falls as canyoneers is highly dependent on not being deemed a detriment to the park.\n<\/p><p>In order to keep the impact of our visibility down, please follow these best practices:\n<\/p>\n<ul><li><u>Avoid running the canyon at peak times.<\/u> e.g. weekends, holidays, etc. Due to it's short length this canyon works well as a summer evening post-work trip too.<\/li>\n<li><u>Keep your team small and efficient.<\/u> Fast and efficient movement through these sequences is important.<\/li>\n<li><u>Anchors need to be placed with consideration to their visibility from the trail.<\/u> Anything placed insight of the trail should be kept to neutral\/natural colors (e.g. black, grey, brown webbing).<\/li><\/ul>\n<p><b>This is not a beginner friendly canyon.<\/b>\n<\/p><p>Despite its short length &amp; and easy access, this route contains a wide range of hazards. Even at the end of an exceedingly dry summer this canyon produces pools with strong currents, pour-over lips, and hydraulics with undercut walls. Further hazards exist in the form of tricky rope-pulls, and a risk of pendulum swings into heavy flow. Your team should contain confident swimmers who can read water conditions, and also have strong rope management experience.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Park at Twin Falls Parking Lot, situated just off junction 34 of I90. Hike the well maintained trail for 1.2 miles until just BEFORE you cross the wooden footbridge across the canyon. DO NOT CROSS THE BRIDGE... (unless you want to take some photos of the canyon below. Instead, deviate from the trail and hike up an obvious user trail up through steep trees and ferns. When you reach the top of the ridge, the trail continues right, along flat ground. Follow this until you come to the top of a large cliff. You will be able to hear and see the river below. Look for a webbing anchor around a tree. If you see it, you have arrived at the start of this epic canyon. There is plenty of room here to suit up and perhaps inhale a Clif bar or 2.\n<\/p><p><i>Water level reference pictures are of R2.

If not, rap all the way down into the pool and swim DCR to a nice ledge to climb out onto. (Don't jump when the flow is strong at all as there is an undercurrent   you could get pulled over the next falls).\n<\/p><p><b>R2:<\/b> 70' off of bolts DCR:\n<\/p><p>This is the crux of the canyon. It can be viewed from the hike-in shortly after departing the official trail. Descend DCR of the flow, around the initial rock bulge, via a redirect, and then straight down parallel to the flow.\n<\/p><p>The redirect bolt is located a short distance down from the anchor, on the underside of the overhanging face. A long quickdraw has been left here to help keep this rap safe. In future this may want to be extended even further to assist the rope pull. Even on the lowest flow days, no one has yet rapped this drop without the help of a fixed guideline or a redirect. Next season the plan is to come up with a more enduring solution to avoiding the flow at other times of year. Note, the only other exit from these R2 bolts is to ascend back to R1.\n<\/p><p>Once in the pool, swim hard DCL to cross the central current, and exit at the boulder field (very slippery when wet!). The rope pull can be tricky due to the combination of current and rope resistance from the redirect. Either minimize the resistance by pulling from a stance close to the end of the rap, or if your rope is long enough (~70m) pull from the boulder field.\n<\/p>\n<style data-mw-deduplicate=\"TemplateStyles:r1062633282\">@media all and (max-width:720px){.mw-parser-output .content .thumb>div:not(.thumbinner){display:flex;justify-content:center;flex-wrap:wrap;align-content:flex-start;flex-direction:column}}body.skin-vector .mw-parser-output div.thumb>div:not(.thumbinner){font-size:94%;text-align:center;overflow:hidden;min-width:100px}body.skin-minerva .mw-parser-output div.thumb>div:not(.thumbinner){margin:0 auto;max-width:100%!important}<\/style> \n<div class=\"thumb tright\">\n<div style=\"display:table;\">\n<span class=\"mw-default-size\" typeof=\"mw:Error mw:File\/Frameless\">\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p><u>Early exit:<\/u> there's a small unsanctioned trail at the back of the boulder field which leads steeply up to the official trail above.\n<\/p><p><b>R3:<\/b> 50' from bolts DCL:\n<\/p><p>In higher flow, a dry option bypasses the middle pothole pool.

It's a good ledge to launch from, which makes clearing the underwater shelf near the waterfall straightforward. This drop could be rappelled either with a meat anchor or a natural anchor.\n<\/p><p>From the pool directly after J1, it's a swim to the main falls. At lower flows it's relatively easy to swim this pool staying DCL to an eddy pool and climb out. However, due to the exposed nature of this swim, a single bolt anchor was placed on the back alcove wall (next to the little waterfall that comes into the pool from DCR). This allows you to swim on rappel to the safety of the climb out ledge DCL. Please note that swimming while attached to a rope is dangerous. As the rope goes tight the current can start flowing over the top of you, and force you under water.\n<\/p><p>There's is a small rock outcrop halfway DCL, which makes regrouping and strategizing the approach to the edge easier.\n<\/p>\n<style data-mw-deduplicate=\"TemplateStyles:r1062633282\">@media all and (max-width:720px){.mw-parser-output .content .thumb>div:not(.thumbinner){display:flex;justify-content:center;flex-wrap:wrap;align-content:flex-start;flex-direction:column}}body.skin-vector .mw-parser-output div.thumb>div:not(.thumbinner){font-size:94%;text-align:center;overflow:hidden;min-width:100px}body.skin-minerva .mw-parser-output div.thumb>div:not(.thumbinner){margin:0 auto;max-width:100%!important}<\/style> \n<div class=\"thumb tright\">\n<div style=\"display:table;\">\n<span class=\"mw-default-size\" typeof=\"mw:Error mw:File\/Frameless\">\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p><b><\/b>\nR4:<b> 140' DCL off of a 2 bolt anchor<\/b>\n<\/p><p>The highlight of the canyon and a contender for top 10 best rappels in Washington! Plenty of options exist for any ability level here. You can rappel more less dry if you stay DCL, or you can skirt the flow in a nice chute which lends itself to a nice long slide on rappel. Or, if you're feeling sendy, rap as far as you possible can DCR to gain a good foothold approximately 10 feet above a 40 slide. Whistle to your team to lower and get the tail of the rope to just tickle the top of the slide, then go off the end of the rope and feel the pure acceleration as you hurtle down the impossibly smooth rock and shoot off the perfectly angled exit ramp into the 15 foot deep pool below. \n<\/p><p>Please DO NOT add any webbing to this anchor as it is in direct line of sight of the viewing platform for hikers and phographers. Great care was taken when placing the bolts so as to make them virtually invisible from the trail.\n<\/p><p>The pull on this last rap can be tough.
