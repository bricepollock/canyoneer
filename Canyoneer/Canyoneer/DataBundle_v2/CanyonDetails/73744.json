  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>Despite the name, 5 distinct waterfalls reside in this beautiful,\ndeep, carved canyon. Although short, this canyon makes up for it with\nmemorable rappels, a multitude of jumps ranging from 10 feet to 90 feet,\nclear water, amazingly deep pools, good afternoon sunshine and if you\ndare, a 40 foot slide that rivals any other in Washington.</p>\n<p><strong>Please be very aware of the high profile nature of the\narea.</strong></p>\n<p>The canyon is within a Washington State Park, a highly managed area\nof land. On a sunny summer weekend, hundreds of tourists will visit the\nfalls. For large sections anyone canyoning will be highly visible. Our\naccess to descend Twin Falls as canyoneers is highly dependent on not\nbeing deemed a detriment to the park.</p>\n<p>In order to keep the impact of our visibility down, please follow\nthese best practices:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><u>Avoid running the canyon at peak times.</u> e.g. weekends,\nholidays, etc. Due to it's short length this canyon works well as a\nsummer evening post-work trip too.</li>\n<li><u>Keep your team small and efficient.</u> Fast and efficient\nmovement through these sequences is important.</li>\n<li><u>Anchors need to be placed with consideration to their visibility\nfrom the trail.</u> Anything placed insight of the trail should be kept\nto neutral/natural colors (e.g. black, grey, brown webbing).</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>This is not a beginner friendly canyon.</strong></p>\n<p>Despite its short length &amp; and easy access, this route contains a\nwide range of hazards. Even at the end of an exceedingly dry summer this\ncanyon produces pools with strong currents, pour-over lips, and\nhydraulics with undercut walls. Further hazards exist in the form of\ntricky rope-pulls, and a risk of pendulum swings into heavy flow. Your\nteam should contain confident swimmers who can read water conditions,\nand also have strong rope management experience.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>Park at Twin Falls Parking Lot, situated just off junction 34 of I90.\nHike the well maintained trail for 1.2 miles until just BEFORE you cross\nthe wooden footbridge across the canyon. DO NOT CROSS THE BRIDGE...\n(unless you want to take some photos of the canyon below. Instead,\ndeviate from the trail and hike up an obvious user trail up through\nsteep trees and ferns. When you reach the top of the ridge, the trail\ncontinues right, along flat ground. Follow this until you come to the\ntop of a large cliff. You will be able to hear and see the river below.\nLook for a webbing anchor around a tree. If you see it, you have arrived\nat the start of this epic canyon. There is plenty of room here to suit\nup and perhaps inhale a Clif bar or 2.</p>\n<p><em>Water level reference pictures are of R2. This is visible from\nthe hike-in shortly after leaving the official trail.</em></p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p><strong>R1:</strong> 130' off a webbing anchor around a tree:</p>\n<p>If you like big jumps (and you cannot lie), consider disconnecting on\nthe big shelf and jumping 55 feet into the deep pool below. If not, rap\nall the way down into the pool and swim DCR to a nice ledge to climb out\nonto. (Don't jump when the flow is strong at all as there is an\nundercurrent + you could get pulled over the next falls).</p>\n<p><strong>R2:</strong> 70' off of bolts DCR:</p>\n<p>This is the crux of the canyon. It can be viewed from the hike-in\nshortly after departing the official trail. Descend DCR of the flow,\naround the initial rock bulge, via a redirect, and then straight down\nparallel to the flow.</p>\n<p>The redirect bolt is located a short distance down from the anchor,\non the underside of the overhanging face. A long quickdraw has been left\nhere to help keep this rap safe. In future this may want to be extended\neven further to assist the rope pull. Even on the lowest flow days, no\none has yet rapped this drop without the help of a fixed guideline or a\nredirect. Next season the plan is to come up with a more enduring\nsolution to avoiding the flow at other times of year. Note, the only\nother exit from these R2 bolts is to ascend back to R1.</p>\n<p>Once in the pool, swim hard DCL to cross the central current, and\nexit at the boulder field (very slippery when wet!). The rope pull can\nbe tricky due to the combination of current and rope resistance from the\nredirect. Either minimize the resistance by pulling from a stance close\nto the end of the rap, or if your rope is long enough (~70m) pull from\nthe boulder field.</p>\n<p><u>Early exit:</u> there's a small unsanctioned trail at the back of\nthe boulder field which leads steeply up to the official trail\nabove.</p>\n<p><strong>R3:</strong> 50' from bolts DCL:</p>\n<p>In higher flow, a dry option bypasses the middle pothole pool. Use\nthe double bolt webbing anchor, high on the canyon wall DCL. This leads\ndown to a ledge above the large pool, from which the rope can be\npulled.</p>\n<p>In lower flow, you may want to opt for the single bolt anchor on the\nunderside of the big boulder. This line allows you to rap into the\npothole and then down the next drop. This drop can also be jumped or\nslid as the pool is some 20ft deep below. Beware that the current in the\nfirst pothole is pushy and once you are in the big pool after the 2nd\nfalls you have to swim hard DCL to avoid being pushed into a huge alcove\nDCR.</p>\n<p><strong>J1:</strong> Jump 12' from the central rock into the pool\ndirectly under the footbridge. It's a good ledge to launch from, which\nmakes clearing the underwater shelf near the waterfall straightforward.\nThis drop could be rappelled either with a meat anchor or a natural\nanchor.</p>\n<p>From the pool directly after J1, it's a swim to the main falls. At\nlower flows it's relatively easy to swim this pool staying DCL to an\neddy pool and climb out. However, due to the exposed nature of this\nswim, a single bolt anchor was placed on the back alcove wall (next to\nthe little waterfall that comes into the pool from DCR). This allows you\nto swim on rappel to the safety of the climb out ledge DCL. Please note\nthat swimming while attached to a rope is dangerous. As the rope goes\ntight the current can start flowing over the top of you, and force you\nunder water.</p>\n<p>There's is a small rock outcrop halfway DCL, which makes regrouping\nand strategizing the approach to the edge easier.</p>\n<p><strong>R4:</strong> 140' DCL off of a 2 bolt anchor</p>\n<p>The highlight of the canyon and a contender for top 10 best rappels\nin Washington! Plenty of options exist for any ability level here. You\ncan rappel more less dry if you stay DCL, or you can skirt the flow in a\nnice chute which lends itself to a nice long slide on rappel. Or, if\nyou're feeling sendy, rap as far as you possible can DCR to gain a good\nfoothold approximately 10 feet above a 40 slide. Whistle to your team to\nlower and get the tail of the rope to just tickle the top of the slide,\nthen go off the end of the rope and feel the pure acceleration as you\nhurtle down the impossibly smooth rock and shoot off the perfectly\nangled exit ramp into the 15 foot deep pool below.</p>\n<p>Please DO NOT add any webbing to this anchor as it is in direct line\nof sight of the viewing platform for hikers and phographers. Great care\nwas taken when placing the bolts so as to make them virtually invisible\nfrom the trail.</p>\n<p>The pull on this last rap can be tough. If you have enough rope, you\ncan swim over to the other side of the pool that makes it considerably\neasier</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<p>Discover Pass is required for the parking lot.
