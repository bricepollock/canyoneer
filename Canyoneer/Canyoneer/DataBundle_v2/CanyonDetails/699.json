  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>A short, rugged Superstitions canyon with one or two rappels.</p>\n<p>From Phoenix, drive east on the US 60, then east on state route 88.\nFrom Tortilla Flat, continue for 9.5 miles as you descend down towards\nFish Creek. Soon after passing the Fish Creek Bridge there will be a\nparking lot on your left with a large pile of dirt. Park here for it is\napproximately where you will emerge.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>From the parking area, hike along the road continuing east for about\n.7 mile. When you can see a break in the cliffs above to the south and\nfeel like you've got a good line on it, go for it. There is a very faint\nuse trail immediately following the bridge that traverses over to the\nsaddle. It is steep, brushy and loose. There is an interesting cave on\nthe right in the cliff with some likely very old metates in it - if\nyou're doing Wasp Canyon, you've got time to check it out. Either way,\ncontinue up and past the cave, through the break and over the saddle,\nthen down the other side to access the canyon.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>Go right (west) down canyon. One or two short rappels of around 35-45\nfeet max and a couple technical downclimbs await.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>Once the canyon opens you can follow the drainage north east all the\nway back to the road and the parking area, or hike along side the\ndrainage on the slopes to avoid the brush. Either way you will run into\ncatclaw acacia. There is an incredible amount of catclaw in the exit of\nthis canyon. Bring long sleeves and pants.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><img src=\"rwl_en.png\" title=\"rwl_en.png\" alt=\"rwl_en.png\" /><a\nhref=\"http://ropewiki.com/User:Super_Amazing_Map?id=Wasp_Canyon_-_Arizona\">Super\nAmazing Map</a> : Wasp Canyon</li>\n<li><img src=\"rwl_en.png\" title=\"rwl_en.png\" alt=\"rwl_en.png\" /><a\nhref=\"http://hikearizona.com/decoder.php?ZTN=19564\">HikeArizona.com</a>\n: Wasp Canyon</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a\nhref=\"https://www.facebook.com/pat.winstanley.7/media_set?set=a.773411639384202.1073741933.100001461198708&amp;type=3\">https://www.facebook.com/pat.winstanley.7/media_set?set=a.773411639384202.1073741933.100001461198708&amp;type=3</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n",
