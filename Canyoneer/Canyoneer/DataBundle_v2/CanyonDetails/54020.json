Once you reach the river there is a sign and a thin trail on the climbers-left of the river up steep roots for 1,400ft of elevation. Here, the river is more open and horizontal and is easy to gear-up.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading3\"><h3 id=\"Inferior_2\">Inferior<\/h3><\/div>\n<p>Move from anchor-to-anchor down many 100  ft rappels often near but not always within the flow of water.
