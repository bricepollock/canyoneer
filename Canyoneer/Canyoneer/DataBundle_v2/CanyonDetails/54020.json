There were 2-3 signs about the cascade that were seen, I don't remember where. Once you reach the river there is a sign and a thin trail on the climbers-left of the river up steep roots for 1,400ft of elevation. Here, the river is more open and horizontal and is easy to gear-up.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading3\"><h3 id=\"Inferior_2\">Inferior<\/h3><\/div>\n<p>Move from anchor-to-anchor down many 100  ft rappels often near but not always within the flow of water. Most anchors are two moderately rusted, decent condition, not spinning steel bolts (Jan 2024). There was one stainless steel bolt on the route.\n<\/p><p>This topo was here before the page was updated for Inferior details so I'm keeping it.
