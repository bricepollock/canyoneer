{"description":"<div class=\"mw-content-ltr mw-parser-output\" lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><p>One rappel that takes you into a slot. This is also done as a hike from the other direction for those that wish to skip the rappel. Options to combine with Lost&amp;Found, MMI, La Boce Arch. Drive 17-19 mile on dirt road that has sand and a bumpy clearance section at the end. There are stories of cars getting stuck.\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Look for a long single dirt lane driveway at the entry to park the car. This is good for 3 cars but only allows cars to park single file so hopefully someone doesn't come in behind to block you in. There are other various spots along the road as well. From the parking lane, follow the slick rock down towards the canyon and avoid stepping on the soil.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>R1: stage one to a pothole ledge 30' and the 150' vertical with a free hang into a dark narrow section.\n<\/p>\n<ul><li>hikers coming in from the other side or other canyoneers will be in the dark slot below and care is needed when deploying the rope or kicking down objects.<\/li>\n<li>various anchor\/rigging options on the ridge: rocks and logs. Unfortunately several people wrapped &amp; pulled ropes around the live tree as evidence by the rope grooves in the bark. Some beta sides recommend using webbing on the tree or anchor to rocks to avoid these grooves. Other sites recommend leaving the rope with a note and hope for good karma that the rope is still there when you come back to pick up. It only adds 15 minutes at the end of the day to pick up the rope. Also, there are a lot of rope grooves in the edges from rope pulls so pulling the rope through the 2 stages and turn may be tough.<\/li>\n<li>some caution notes: there is a large log jammed at the edge of the pothole ledge so have people below stay clear of the path. Also, there is a boulder wedged high in the crack so avoid getting the rope tangled on that when tossing the rope.<\/li><\/ul>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Follow the social trail and avoid stepping on the soil.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Red_tape\">Red tape<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Beta_sites\">Beta sites<\/h2><\/div>\n<ul><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http:\/\/roadtripryan.com\/go\/t\/utah\/moab\/wintercampwash\">RoadTripRyan.com<\/a> &#160;: Winter Camp Wash<\/li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http:\/\/climb-utah.com\/Moab\/wintercamp.htm\">Climb-Utah.com<\/a> &#160;: Winter Camp Slot - Arches National Park<\/li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http:\/\/ropewiki.com\/User:Super_Amazing_Map?id=Winter_Camp_Slot_-_Moab_Area\">Super Amazing Map<\/a> &#160;: Winter Camp Slot<\/li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http:\/\/ropewiki.com\/User:Moab_Canyoneering_Book?id=Winter_Camp_Slot\">Moab Canyoneering Book by Derek A.
