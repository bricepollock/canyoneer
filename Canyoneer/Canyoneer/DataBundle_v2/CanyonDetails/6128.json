Its main appeal is as a training venue for beginners - both in terms of technical skills &amp; overall canyon experience. It offers a mixture of both wet &amp; dry rappels at moderate angles. Even a little cave to explore too.\n<\/p><p>Nearby <a href=\"\/wiki\/O%27Toole_Creek\" title=\"O&#39;Toole Creek\">O'Toole Creek<\/a> is an obvious progression for beginners after this. Both can be done in a single day.\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<ul><li>Turn off the South Skagit Highway onto the Finney-Cumberland forest road [48.5055, -122.0142].<\/li>\n<li>Climb the switch backs up out of the valley, and onto NF-17.<\/li>\n<li>The road is in decent condition and should accessible with a regular clearance vehicle.<\/li>\n<li>Leave one vehicle at the exit point [48.4706, -121.9660] and then continue uphill 1km\/0.6 mile until a left turning.<\/li>\n<li>Take the left turning [48.4618, -121.9628] onto a smaller forest road which after 2200ft\/700m opens into a clearing, park here (or at a slightly earlier pullout).<\/li>\n<li>The route starts a few feet away.<\/li><\/ul>\n<p>Half-wearing your wetsuit is an effective way of staying cool on the first section while minimizing the amount you need to carry down to the creek.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>From the clearing at the top, a dry slot canyon immediately drops northwest (48.4676, -121.9628). The first 3 raps are dry, and take you to the bottom of the slot.\n<\/p><p>The route has been bolted to maximize training opportunities. Experienced groups will likely combine the first 3 raps, and\/or down climb the last section.\n<\/p>\n<ul><li><b>R1<\/b> - 50' From a tree at top of the slot.<\/li>\n<li><b>R2<\/b> - 15' Bolts DCR with webbing, directly above an overhang.<\/li>\n<li><b>R3<\/b> - 40' Bolts DCL, below the overhang.<\/li><\/ul>\n<p>From the exit of the slot continue straight into the forest. Orange tape marks a route north to the creek about 800ft away.\n<\/p><p>After reaching the creek, walk &amp; scramble downstream until the first major obstacle.\n<\/p>\n<ul><li><b>R4<\/b> - Two options:\n<ul><li><i>Dry:<\/i> 30' Bolts DCL above rock slab provide a dry option and a good place to practice ascending.<\/li>\n<li><i>Wet<\/i>: Webbing on log DCR provides a wet route, dropping you into a small rain room.<\/li><\/ul><\/li><\/ul>\n<p>A cave DCL of the rock slab takes you back up to the top, allowing for an easy but highly adventurous method of lapping this rappel.\n<\/p>\n<ul><li><b>R5<\/b> - 50' Bolts on the back wall of a pool above an obvious mellow slope. Rap to flat area below still in sight. There is a redirect option DCR to avoid flow if desired<\/li><\/ul>\n<ul><li><b>R6<\/b> - 30' Webbing from tree DCR take you down the final slope. Creek then makes a right hand turn toward the north.<\/li><\/ul>\n<p>Downclimb DCR over a small drop\/logjam utilizing the flakes on the rock face.\n<\/p>\n<ul><li><b>R7<\/b> - After some potentially slippery slabs, 35' from webbing on a tree DCR drops you over the penultimate waterfall.<\/li>\n<li><b>R8<\/b> - Very shortly after R7 bolts on wall DCR drop you 50' into the final pool, with the road
