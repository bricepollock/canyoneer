Unfortunately it will also bring your attention to the fact that the area is filled with awesome caves that are all closed due to white nose.  Recommend doing it in as wet of conditions as possible.  If you have the time, stamina, and skills, this creek might be more fun than Shop Creek in low flow.\n<\/p><p>The whole thing can be hiked without ropes (though maybe not anymore with cave closures), but rappelling down keeps you in the canyon with the water falls, and does not feel particularly contrived.\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>You can shuttle from the top of the drainage off AR74, or you can hike up from Kyles Landing Campground.  Head to the far end of the campground where trail access to the BRT and ORT start.  Turn off onto the Primitive Trail that will take you up the ridge between Indian Creek and Bear Creek, then traverses around below the rim of the canyon.  Note that this is a very primitive trail and some bushwhacking to follow the CalTopo may be required.  As long as you are working your way up to the Drop In you are on the right track.\n<\/p><p>Two options for entering Indian Creek.\nYou can continue following the rim to the top of the creek, allowing you to actually traverse through the Eye of the Needle.\nYou can also turn right into the gully marked on the CalTopo to start the technical stuff early and get in extra downclimbing, a bypassable 20 ft. rappel, and a beautiful multi-stage (110 ft. and 80 ft.) rappel before you even enter Indian Creek.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>If you start from the top of Indian Creek, above Eye of the Needle, you'll boulder hop down and encounter a couple of optional, easily bypassable rappels and then hit the trail that comes in from the right.  Below here is another optional rappel. \n<\/p><p>Continuing downstream, the canyon gets more exciting.  A short rappel will be required to enter a shallow box canyon.  The walls rise up as you round the corner to the \"Eye of the Needle.\"  Unfortunately a lot of water gets diverted below ground here, so things will have to be cranking for water to be flowing through the natural arch here.  Either way it is pretty cool.  \n<\/p><p>If you drop in through the gully, downclimb\/hike for a bit before hitting a bypassable 20 ft. rappel.\nR1 and R2 are required to get you in to Indian Creek and will take some technical skills, especially around natural anchor selection and construction.  In dry conditions they can be done as two rappels with the help of a large ledge.  In wet conditions it may be too slippery to stop at the ledge.\nR1 - 110 ft., but can be done and pulled with a 200 ft. rope and an assisted downclimb to a large ledge.  Anchor is large tree off of the canyon DCR (anchor constructed October 2021).\nR2 - 80 ft. off of anchor on tree DCR (ghosted as of October 2021).  Anchor is solid but approach is exposed and may require a belay or handline especially if there is water. \n<\/p><p>Now you've entered Indian Creek.  If you came in via the gully, scramble up 100 yds. to see Eye of the Needle then continue downstream.\n<\/p><p>Downstream from Eye of the Needle a bit of rock hopping brings you to the edge of a drop.  Anchor is a DCL tree (anchor built as of October 2021).  If the water has left you, it will resume down below as you rappel 70 ft. down to it and a wide pool.  From there you could stay on rope and rappel another 30 ft. down the next and final drop into a narrower and deeper pool below (recommended).  It is possible when dry to get off after the 70 ft. rappel and climb up to the right and rappel 20 ft. off of a tree to stay a bit more dry, but be aware it is an exposed anchor.  If doing the rappel in two parts, be aware to set the pull and direction of pull carefully to prevent a stuck rope.  If doing as 1 rappel, recommended 250-300 ft. of rope to make sure you will be able to pull.\n<\/p><p>Rest of the canyon is easy and pleasant creek hiking and scrambling with a few possible jumps depending on the flow.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Hike down the beautiful canyon, and make a right on the Buffalo River Trail at the bottom back to Kyles Landing.  You can also continue past the BRT on Indian Creek all the way to the Buffalo River and swim\/hike the river back to Kyle's Landing.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Red_tape\">Red tape<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Going around here with helmets, ropes, and climbing gear might make it look like your caving, which could get you some negative attention if any rangers are around.
