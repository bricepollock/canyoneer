class=\"mw-content-ltr mw-parser-output\" lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><p>Ross Creek is a good early-season canyon for when the rest of the Sierras are running too high. Its tight channels make for exciting, pushy rappels. Only partially explored, the final few rappels look like they’ll be a lot of fun when somebody gets around to rappelling them.\n<\/p><p><br \/>\nBe warned that Ross has foot-grabbing cracks, strainers, and rope grabbers on almost every rappel.\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>From the parking, head north along the access road, then drop into the drainage around where it starts to get cliffy. Dropping in later saves some inconvenient sections in the watercourse.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>R0: ~50’, fiddlestick off of buckeye tree DCR to drop into drainage.\n<\/p><p>R1: ~30’, single bolt DCR on the above a flat spot that’s the lowest you can downclimb using cracks in the wall. This rappel should probably be set higher and descended further in the flow.\nA few cascades follow which we bypassed, but future groups might try rappelling them. \n<\/p><p>R2: ~60’ bypassed, fiddlestick DCL\n<\/p><p>R3: 200’ off a boulder pile DCR. This rappel could probably be rigged shorter if your rope doesn’t reach, and can be bypassed entirely DCL, but is fun the whole way if you have the rope length for it. Watch out for a foot-grabbing crack halfway down\n<\/p><p>R4: ~80’ Fiddlestick off a boulder high and dry DCL. This could probably be rigged in the flow DCR, or off a rock chock mid DCL, but we played it safe on the first descent trip.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>After more creekwalking, the road comes into view. If you choose to end the canyon here, there’s a dam with a nice pool and rocks to dry gear on. Hike up the road until you see a trail marker to your right, which is a nice shortcut to get back to the car.\n<\/p><p><br \/>\nOur group ran out of time and exited at the dam, but there’s three more large rappels at the bottom of the canyon right before it hits the San Joaquin. If you try this, definitely bring a bolt kit. Depending on the flows in the river, you could then either hike half a mile down the river channel to the powerhouse and hike up the road, or bushwhack up the ridge DCL.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Red_tape\">Red tape<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Minarets road is sometimes closed for repairs without updating Caltrans or Google Maps.
