There is a deep drainage dip at\nmile 4. There was even a sedan and other SUV-2WD at the parking area. A\nbit risky without the clearance/4WD so try to have a follow vehicle in\ncase one of the vehicles gets stuck. It helps to have a real spare tire\nand check it is good before the drive. Death Valley dirt roads are\nnotorious for causing tire damage.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>The waypoints in the KML map contain detailed descriptions of all the\nrappels (courtesy of Bluugnome.com). 2016-02-13 Update to the R09(BN\nR05) 285' rappel: there were two anchors were added 12/2015 and the\ncanyon can now be descended with a 200' rope. Check that the anchor\nexist &amp; if there is adequate material at the ledge if an anchor\nneeds to be built. The Bluugnome beta has not been updated to reflect\nthis.</p>\n<p>Rappels 1 to 12 (BN indicates Bluugnome points as reference).
