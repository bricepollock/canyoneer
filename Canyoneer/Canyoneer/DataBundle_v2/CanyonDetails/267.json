east on highway 190 to the turnoff for Dante's View. Follow the signs to Dante's View, which is another 13.1 miles.\n<\/p><p>From the Dantes View parking lot, start hiking north on the unsigned but obvious trail up the ridge. After 3.0 miles, fork left off the trail, continuing north on the ridge for a couple-hundred feet to the top of a small hump. This is the top of \"Erebus Ridge,\" a west-facing ridge that is the approach for canyons Typhon4, Erebus, Purgatory, and Purgamal, and an alternate approach for Abysmal. \n<\/p><p>Turn left and head west-northwest down Erebus Ridge for about .6 miles, descending about 900 feet. This spot is not very obvious, except the terrain to the right (north) finally looks reasonable, and there are now (after 14 years of canyoneering traffic) even signs of human foot traffic. \n<\/p><p>Head down the slope to the north, into the drainage. This is an upper drainage of Typhon4. \n<\/p><p>Head downcanyon in Typhon4 for a couple-hundred feet and then exit up the slope to the right (north). \n<\/p><p>At the top of the ridge, turn right (northeast) and contour over to the next drainage. This drainage is the top Erebus Canyon. \n<\/p><p>Continue north-northwest for about a quarter mile, over rolling terrain but gradually losing elevation. You will cross a broad drainage north of Erebus Canyon. This drainage also leads into Erebus and is not the route to Purgatory. Continue a bit further and turn left into the drainage that is a full quarter-mile beyond Erebus. This drainage is the top of Purgatory Canyon.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Waypoints in the KML map contain detailed descriptions of all the rappels (courtesy of Bluugnome.com).\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>To reach the final canyon floor, down climb on the right to the pothole, traverse the lip, and exit on the left.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Red_tape\">Red tape<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Beta_sites\">Beta sites<\/h2><\/div>\n<ul><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http:\/\/bluugnome.com\/cyn_route\/dv\/dv_purgatory-nf\/dv_purgatory-nf.aspx\">BluuGnome.com<\/a> &#160;: Purgatory Canyon North Fork<\/li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http:\/\/ropewiki.com\/User:Super_Amazing_Map?id=Purgatory_Canyon_(Death_Valley)_-_Nevada\">Super Amazing Map<\/a> &#160;: Purgatory Canyon (Death Valley)<\/li><\/ul>\n<p><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https:\/\/adamhaydock.blogspot.com\/2018\/12\/purgatory-canyon-3aiv-death-valley.html\">EVEN FURTHER PURGATORY CANYON<\/a>==Trip reports and media==\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Background\">Background<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Discovered and named by Rick Kent.
