{"description":"<div class=\"mw-content-ltr mw-parser-output\" lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><p>There is a landfill at the top of this drainage so the canyon is strewn with trash and the water is no doubt toxic with plastics, paint, ink, etc. leaching off of the garbage. Canyoneers continually collect bags of garbage but it is impossible to pick out all of the little pieces wrapped around tree branches and in little pockets in the rocks. Be careful not to drink any water and wash off immediately after exiting for your health. \nThe final rappel into the sea is what makes this canyon route one of the most popular and memorable in Flores. One nice, vertical slide about 20 feet. Most of the pools were too shallow to jump, but there were a couple small jump opportunities. This canyon is rated X because you need a boat pick up in the sea or it is a very long swim and you could get carried out to sea by the current.\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Red_tape\">Red tape<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Beta_sites\">Beta sites<\/h2><\/div>\n<ul><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http:\/\/descente-canyon.com\/canyoning\/canyon-description\/23235\">Descente-Canyon.com<\/a> &#160;: Barrosas<\/li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http:\/\/ropewiki.com\/User:Azores_Canyoning_Book?id=Barrosas_Inf..\">Azores Canyoning Book by Desnivel<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http:\/\/canyon.carto.net\/cwiki\/bin\/view\/Canyons\/BarrosasCanyon\">Canyon.Carto.net<\/a> &#160;: Barrosas inferior<\/li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http:\/\/verticalwatercanyoning.com\/profili\/portogallo\/barrosas\">VerticalWaterCanyoning.com<\/a> &#160;: Barrosas<\/li><\/ul>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Background\">Background<\/h2><\/div>\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nParsed by mw‐api‐ext.codfw.main‐6779cc57fc‐m8c98\nCached time: 20240914191953\nCache expiry: 2592000\nReduced expiry: false\nComplications: [show‐toc]\nCPU time usage: 0.006 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.007 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 21\/1000000\nPost‐expand include size: 0\/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 0\/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 2\/100\nExpensive parser function count: 0\/500\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0\/20\nUnstrip post‐expand size: 0\/5000000 bytes\nNumber of Wikibase entities loaded: 0\/400\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%    0.000      1 -total\n-->\n<\/div>","waterRating":"C","rappelCountMin":8,"permit":"No","months":["Apr","May","Jun","Jul","Aug","Sep","Oct"],"name":"Barrosas","url":"https:\/\/ropewiki.com\/Barrosas","id":16116,"rappelLongestMeters":30,"timeRating":"II","rappelCountMax":8,"longitude":-31.1788,"technicalRating":3,"geojson":{"type":"FeatureCollection","features":[{"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[[-31.1788,39.4934,0]]},"properties":{"name":"Start"},"type":"Feature"},{"properties":{"name":"End"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[[-31.17573,39.500752,0]]}},{"geometry":{"type":"LineString","coordinates":[[-31.178822,39.493404,0],[-31.178835,39.493602,0],[-31.178834,39.493754,0],[-31.178794,39.493831,0],[-31.178707,39.493913,0],[-31.178585,39.493998,0],[-31.178404,39.494106,0],[-31.17825,39.494203,0],[-31.178089,39.494303,0],[-31.177976,39.494399,0],[-31.177948,39.494509,0],[-31.177969,39.494735,0],[-31.177942,39.494829,0],[-31.17782,39.495,0],[-31.177685,39.495175,0],[-31.177625,39.49528,0],[-31.177616,39.495338,0],[-31.177654,39.495475,0],[-31.177655,39.495562,0],[-31.177636,39.495641,0],[-31.177582,39.495712,0],[-31.177519,39.495805,0],[-31.177487,39.495914,0],[-31.177478,39.496076,0],[-31.177469,39.496254,0],[-31.177465,39.496466,0],[-31.177518,39.496618,0],[-31.177538,39.496737,0],[-31.177545,39.496824,0],[-31.177501,39.496918,0],[-31.177349,39.497036,0],[-31.177192,39.497123,0],[-31.177049,39.497208,0],[-31.176954,39.497288,0],[-31.176937,39.497361,0],[-31.17698,39.497429,0],[-31.177046,39.497472,0],[-31.177129,39.497549,0],[-31.177148,39.497665,0],[-31.17711,39.497795,0],[-31.176955,39.497895,0],[-31.176837,39.497993,0],[-31.176756,39.498058,0],[-31.176716,39.498125,0],[-31.176616,39.498224,0],[-31.176487,39.498325,0],[-31.176412,39.498431,0],[-31.176353,39.49857,0],[-31.176335,39.498634,0],[-31.176362,39.49877,0],[-31.176418,39.498864,0],[-31.176455,39.498955,0],[-31.176437,39.499068,0],[-31.176406,39.499144,0],[-31.176266,39.499248,0],[-31.176092,39.499376,0],[-31.17599,39.499497,0],[-31.175918,39.499636,0],[-31.175911,39.499752,0],[-31.175946,39.499852,0],[-31.175971,39.499931,0],[-31.175998,39.50003,0],[-31.175986,39.500143,0],[-31.175918,39.500215,0],[-31.175812,39.500307,0],[-31.175754,39.50037,0],[-31.175761,39.500452,0],[-31.175793,39.500526,0],[-31.175807,39.500613,0],[-31.175775,39.50069,0],[-31.17573,39.500752,0]]},"properties":{"name":"Descent"},"type":"Feature"}]},"shuttleSeconds":null,"version":"9fb05f0ada379019034780a60682adee88950a4ecdad5c4e551857ab23e2aac0","riskRating":"X","quality":4.1,"latitude":39.4934,"vehicle":null}
