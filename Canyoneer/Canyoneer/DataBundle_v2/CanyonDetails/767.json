The slot will become skinny again forcing you up off the deck a few feet where you will stem / galumph to a silo about 300 feet down canyon of the big choke stone. There will be 5 silos in this section. The first 3 silos are not too wide; have good features and easy to cross about 20 feet off the deck. These 3 silos; while not physically difficult to cross; do pose a mental challenge as they look and feel like black holes waiting to swallow you up if you fall in. The 4th silo has a downclimb / slither of about 15 feet where you may need to jump down the last 3 feet to a sand floor. The climb / stem up out of the down canyon side is easy and only a few feet up to where you will continue stemming / galumphing down canyon between skinny walls. The 5th silo involves a wider sketchy feeling bridge to cross but with lower consequences over a shallow hole where a hand line can be set to assist people out if they go down in. Just after the 5th silo is pothole to cross by going around an awkward nose on the LDC side. Send your better climber around first who can then reach out assist others by pulling them around the nose. A potshot or pack toss may a be a good idea here in case you can not get across it and sand scours out making the pothole deeper. Note: This pothole to cross with the awkward nose to go around on the LDC side while crossing can be crossed by tall people fairly easily. I am 6 foot even and can barely reach to make this work. To cross and go around the nose step over to the pothole and reach up and around the corner. If you reach far enough you will find a solid edge to grab with a your hands and pull your self up around the nose and to the other side. The hand grab spot is out of sight and feels scary to reach for since you do not want to fall in. So support from behind can make this easier. (Data by bluugnome.com)"

This pothole is sometimes shallow enough to allow a partner assist through and go kind of un-noticed when sand has filled in. As sand scours out this pothole can be come 15 feet deep and deeper requiring a potshot toss to get out of. The danger / challenge of this pothole is when sand is scoured out revealing a deep pothole but sand has filled in the features just down canyon creating sloped sand down into the pothole making a potshot exit extremely difficult. In those conditions the potshot tossed for exit is easily dragged back into the pothole when any substantial weight is placed on it. An aggressive multi-person partner assist of your lightest team mate can help them carefully get out of the pothole placing very little weight on the potshot line. (Data by bluugnome.com)"
