  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>With 2 nice rappels, a couple drenchings, a couple hard starts, a\nmomentary free-hang, and most-likely a gallery of people watching you\nfrom the bridge, this really is a gem that may only take 30-minutes, and\ncould take less than one hour from town including drive time there and\nback. A great combination to introduce visiting canyoneers to \"C\" class\ncanyons is to do Lower Angel Creek first, as the first couple raps are\nshorter, and then Portland Creek in the same day.</p>\n<p>Portland Creek is a blast if you only have an hour or two to spare.\nWith a small competent group this canyon can be done in 30 minutes doing\nthe \"Sneak Route\" or 1 hour if doing the full route, which does not add\nany rappels but adds a little more scenic in-canyon hiking and\ndownclimbing. Even though you will get drenched, a wet suit is typically\nnot necessary, unless someone is extremely sensitive to the cold or you\nare going on a very cold day. More important than a wetsuit is a good\nrain shell with a hood.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>From Ouray Hot Springs Park drive south on Highway 550 for 1.8 miles\nto a left turn-off for Amphitheater Campground Road. There is a sign for\nthis road. Drive up Amphitheater Campground Road for 1/10th of a mile\nuntil you come to a one-lane rickety bridge. Park on the left just\nbefore the bridge.</p>\n<p>Walk across the bridge and as you do so, look down to gauge the water\nlevel. Like all Ouray Canyons, it typically is not safe to go before\nJuly or after September. It is cold in this canyon as it slots up and\nyou will get drenched. Just after the bridge on the right is a sign for\nBaby Bathtubs Trailhead. We will describe two options: the \"sneak route\"\nand the \"full route\". To do the Sneak Route, drop in to the creek right\nat the trailhead sign and you will be just upstream from the bridge. To\ndo the Full Route, proceed up the Baby Bathtubs Trail for about a 15\nminute hike. After the first 5 minutes you will cross the North Fork of\nPortland Creek. On the other side there are numerous paths to get up a\nsmall ridge. It doesn't matter which one you take. Staying to the right\nwill give you good views from several perches overlooking Portland\nCreek. It is a small canyon, but pretty nonetheless. Hike up the trail\nuntil it meets the water level. This is your drop in.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>Shortly downstream from the drop-in for the Full Route, which is\nreally a walk-in, you come to a couple downclimbs of about 6 to 8 feet.\nOn the first one, notice how slippery the rock is where the water flows\ndown the chute on the left. Experienced down-climbers will have little\nproblem. Since this is a beginner-friendly canyon, don't be surprised if\nsome people need a partner assist. Alternatively, on the right side\nthere was a hand-line that can be used as an aid. As you are \"creeking\"\ndown this section look up every now and then to appreciate the beauty of\nthis tiny canyon, as there is little other reason to do it. After about\n15 minutes you come to the bridge, and the drop-in for the Sneak\nRoute.</p>\n<p>If you elected to do the sneak route, you will find yourself at the\nfirst rappel station almost as soon as your feet hit the water. Go\ndownstream about 20 feet and you will find an anchor DCL. This anchor\nwill take you down the middle of the watercourse and can be used in low\nflow, or in higher flow for experienced swiftwater canyoneers. The rock\nsurfaces here are very slick and this is a good place to use your safety\ntether while measuring rope length. Always send an experienced canyoneer\ndown first, preferably experienced in flowing waterfalls, and have them\ngive a fireman belay to any beginners in your group. Use caution giving\na belay in high water, which can lead to accidents or drowning. Even\nthough this canyon is short, this rappel is not easy for a number of\nreasons, especially for canyoneers with only A-class or B-class\ncanyoning experience. This first rap is 60 feet and very slick all the\nway down. The best form here is to go on your hip opposite your brake\nhand side. Trying to stay on your feet is an exercise in futility and a\nsure way to bang your knees up for no reason. You can not avoid the\nwater. You will be soaked almost all the way down. Get in and enjoy\nit.</p>\n<p>In high flow or for canyoneers with little swiftwater experience,\nthere is an additional anchor located about 15 feet DCL of the first\nanchor. Rappelling from this anchor will avoid the the highest water at\nthe bottom of the falls, and will make for a very clean rope pull. The\nperson to set the rope should stay low to the rock and can use a\nhandline to assist getting to the anchor. A rope can also be set up\nbetween the two anchors for canyoneers to clip onto with their\ntethers.</p>\n<p>The second rappel is right after the floor of the first one. It is a\n2-stage rappel, 40 feet in total. The anchor is bolted DCL. Both of\nthese rappels are difficult starts that involve going over a slick lip.\nBest to do the sit-and-start method here. The bottom one brings you into\na tiny free-hang. In some years, this second rappel is a simple\ndownclimb, but more often than not is a rappel.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>At the floor of the second rappel, you can bag up your rope and put\naway your rain shell. Hike downstream for about 100-150 yards and you\nwill see a huge boulder DCR. Head to the right up the slopes into a\nsmall narrow slot. There are two lower fifth class climbing moves to get\nout from this point. Beginners may want a hand or a handline tied to a\ntree above.</p>\n<p>Update August 2018: There's a bright green rope tied along the trail\nto use as a handline.</p>\n<p>Some canyoners exit slightly further downstream via a social trail on\ncanyon left, but this exit crosses private property and should be\navoided. The owner has placed \"no trespassing\" signs along the social\ntrail higher up. Please respect his or her property rights and avoid\nthis exit, tempting as it may be.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a\nhref=\"http://ropewiki.com/Canyoning_in_the_Colorado_San_Juan_Mountains_Book\">Canyoning\nin the Colorado San Juan Mountains Book by Ira Lewis</a>\\</li>\n<li><b><font color=blue>Current Water Level Assessment from Canyoning\nColorado:</font></b> <a\nhref=\"https://canyoningcolorado.com/canyon-reports\">https://canyoningcolorado.com/canyon-reports</a></li>\n<li><img src=\"rwl_en.png\" title=\"rwl_en.png\" alt=\"rwl_en.png\" /><a\nhref=\"http://ropewiki.com/User:Super_Amazing_Map?id=Ivans_Tail_-_Colorado\">Super\nAmazing Map</a> : Ivans Tail</li>\n<li><img src=\"rwl_en.png\" title=\"rwl_en.png\" alt=\"rwl_en.png\" /><a\nhref=\"http://icopro.org/canyon/view/id/283\">Icopro.org</a> : Portland\nCreek</li>\n<li><img src=\"rwl_en.png\" title=\"rwl_en.png\" alt=\"rwl_en.png\" /><a\nhref=\"http://ropewiki.com/User:Super_Amazing_Map?id=Portland_Creek_-_Colorado\">Super\nAmazing Map</a> : Portland Creek</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.example.com\">EVEN-FURTHER, PORTLAND\nCANYON</a></p>\n<p>The following videos on YouTube contain scenes from Portland Creek\n(Ivan's Tail):<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Ouray Canyoning Highlights 2013</strong><br />\n* <a href=\"http://youtu.be/pn2v8Myhx_Y\">With Soundtrack</a></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://youtu.be/j8L_AF8Qzu0\">Without Soundtrack</a></li>\n<li><img src=\"rwl_en.png\" title=\"rwl_en.png\" alt=\"rwl_en.png\" /><a\nhref=\"http://candition.com/canyons/ivans-tail\">Candition.com</a> : Ivans\nTail</li>\n</ul>\n<p>8/12/15 Speed Descent: 14mins, 20seconds (car-to-car), setting and\ncleaning own ropes. ;)</p>\n<p>08/15/2022 YouTube video of Ivan's Tail, an easy, wet canyon that is\neasy to video, take pictures and entertain spectators:</p>\n<p><code>{{#ev:youtube|J4KzHGcAEgk}}</code></p>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n",
