  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>Located at the bottom of Coalbank Pass, Cascade Creek offers a fun,\nshort, slot canyon experience with minimal approach and exit. The views\nare beautiful as you downclimb and jump several 8 to 15-feet drops\nthrough the slot. There are basically 4 obstacles that are either jumps,\nslides, or rappels, depending on conditions.</p>\n<p>This canyon is very short, only 0.1 miles, so it should not be\nconsidered a destination by itself. However it is an excellent option\nwhen doing some of the other canyons in Silverton, such as <a\nhref=\"South_Fork_Mineral_Creek\" title=\"wikilink\">South Fork Mineral\nCreek</a>. Competent small groups may run the whole canyon in 30\nminutes, with the descent taking about 15 minutes, and many will choose\nto run it twice or more.</p>\n<p>You may see locals going through in shorts and girls in 2-pieces and\nbarefoot without any gear and wonder why it's rated 3CI and not 2CI.\nThat's because you have to bring a rope to send the first person down\neach obstacle on rappel to test water depth. If you happen to be behind\na group and can see where they are jumping, then you are probably okay\nto do the same, but the canyon rating would still be a 3.</p>\n<p>People have been killed in this canyon, getting swept away when the\nwater levels are too high - especially during the runoff season. The\nwaterflow checkpoint is at the start of the descent, where a large dead\ntree crosses the span of the creek. The canyon you see at this point is\nwide, it gets narrow down to 5 feet wide later. If you are not\ncomfortable with the amount of water you see at the start of the canyon\nabort the descent.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>From Ouray Hot Springs Park drive south on Highway 550 for 23.5 miles\nto the only gas station in Silverton, on the right side of the highway.\nFrom the Silverton gas station, continue another 19.3 miles south on Hwy\n550 where you will see a sign for Old Lime Creek Road. Make a left and\npark in a large dirt parking area.</p>\n<p>CHECK USGS GAUGE!!! There should be cell/data service either at the\nTH or at Purgatory. <a\nhref=\"https://waterdata.usgs.gov/co/nwis/uv?site_no=09359082\">https://waterdata.usgs.gov/co/nwis/uv?site_no=09359082</a>\nIf its above 25 cfs, you should have life jacket, helmet, wetsuit, and\nswift water skills before proceeding!!! Would not recommend above 50\ncfs.</p>\n<p>Most waterfalls can be seen from trails above the canyon on the north\nside. Be sure to see as much of the canyon before committing. There can\nbe new logs or higher levels after rain events at any point of the\nseason.</p>\n<p>There is an obvious use-trail heading down to the creek level just\ndownstream of the massive culvert where Cascade Creek flows under the\nhighway. This is your watercourse. Before hiking down, you might want to\ngear up in wetsuit, etc., as the hike down is less than 5 minutes.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>Several of the jumps can be done higher or lower by climbing up on\nrock edges. The slides can also be jumped. Always check the depth or\nwatch other groups in front of you to avoid messing up the landing.</p>\n<p>Jump 1: Within a few minutes of starting to creek your way down. To\navoid a slide into a big rock, climb up on the left side. There, you see\njump of less than 10 feet height. Usually shallow, jump right in the\nmiddle of the camber. (2021 Theres a tree sticking right in middle, jump\nto slight left)</p>\n<p>Slide 1 or jump: The slide (5 feet), is on canyon just left the\nwatercourse. May be climbed on left then jumped as well with the proper\nform at about 10 feet high. The water depth was about 8 feet deep right\nat the white-water froth in the narrow grey camber.</p>\n<p>Update 7/5/21. A submerged logs in the middle of a twisted section of\nnext slot. After slide 1/ jump 2 go down a short subway corridor\ncarefully. Stay high on the left to avoid the current sweeping you into\nthe above mention strainers. After the logs are past you either jump (6\nft) on high left, or slide/ float if the current is high enough. Walking\nalso works fine. Then stay right and stay out of water course to scope\nout next feature.</p>\n<p>Waterfall (Mandatory at higher levels): Yellow and orange rock is the\nsetting for the next major drop. Usually jumped from a high right ledge\neither at or above water level. Jump out and right to the outside edge\nof big boil. At higher levels, the bottom of this waterfall can act as a\ndangerous hydraulic. Be sure to jump out. When levels are lower, one can\nsimply slide down the right side ramp into the water.</p>\n<p>After this feature, you are in a huge, loud cave like camber. Make\nyour way down and stay high to the right. The next drop is usually\njumped from a higher ledge on the right side. This drop doesn't make for\na great slide and the water level below the right ledges is almost\nalways bottomless. the Drop ranges from 12-25 ft depend on what ledge\nyou jump off.</p>\n<p>Final waterfall and mandatory jump: A 15 feet jump into a large pool\nthat is usually deep enough to not feel bottom. There is a shelf\nunderwater canyon left that jutts out about 3 feet so be sure to jump\nout to clear this. It should be visible.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>After the last drop and the canyon narrows open up, exit Canyon Left\n(north side) and use the climber's trail to return to the dirt Lime\nCreek Road and walk back to your car parked closer to the bridge.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a\nhref=\"http://ropewiki.com/Canyoning_in_the_Colorado_San_Juan_Mountains_Book\">Canyoning\nin the Colorado San Juan Mountains Book by Ira Lewis</a></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><a\nhref=\"https://waterdata.usgs.gov/co/nwis/uv?site_no=09359082\">https://waterdata.usgs.gov/co/nwis/uv?site_no=09359082</a>\n- USGS watergauge- A \"safe\" waterflow is 25 cfs and under.

A short, steep\nhike takes you to an approximately 18-foot-tall waterfall thundering\ninto a deep pool. You can climb up beside the falls, perch anywhere from\n15 to 40 feet above the water and jump from where you feel comfortable.\n<a\nhref=\"http://ropewiki.com/Adrenaline_Falls\">http://ropewiki.com/Adrenaline_Falls</a><br />\n* <b>Baker’s Bridge</b> is located where Old Shalona Road crosses the\nAnimas River. It’s where Paul Newman and Robert Redford jump from a\ncliff into a river in “Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.” (Through\nediting, they land in a different river, not the Animas, in the film.)\nJumping from this bridge isn’t just dangerous — it’s illegal. Instead,\npeople climb down to nearby cliffs of various heights — as high as 17\nfeet — and jump from there. <a\nhref=\"http://ropewiki.com/Bakers_Bridge\">http://ropewiki.com/Bakers_Bridge</a><br />\n* <b>Cascade</b> isn’t just one jump. It’s a run through a slot canyon,\nwith mountain runoff providing a series of natural water slides and\nwaterfalls to jump. Once you enter Cascade, you’re committed to being in\ncold water for about half an hour. <a\nhref=\"http://ropewiki.com/Cascade_Creek_(Durango_Waterpark)\">http://ropewiki.com/Cascade_Creek_(Durango_Waterpark)</a><br />\n<br />\n*<a\nhref=\"http://www.verdepr.com/2013/05/10-things-to-love-about-a-durango-summer/\">http://www.verdepr.com/2013/05/10-things-to-love-about-a-durango-summer/</a>\nThings-To-Beat-The-Heat-In-Durango article At the bottom of the\ncanyon:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a\nhref=\"http://www.mountainproject.com/v/cascade-canyon/105827468\">http://www.mountainproject.com/v/cascade-canyon/105827468</a>\n: Summer Sport Climbing is on the north side:</li>\n<li><a\nhref=\"http://www.mountainproject.com/v/cascade-creek/105747106\">http://www.mountainproject.com/v/cascade-creek/105747106</a>\n: Winter Ice Climbing is on the South Side</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a\nhref=\"https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.10153619598301103.1073742079.669366102&amp;type=1&amp;l=d07042ea9d\">Facebook\nAlbum</a></li>\n<li><a\nhref=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCILGjFEKBs&amp;t=165s\">2018 Low\nwater POV Video</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://youtu.be/kIteh08b_14\">2021 40 CFS GO PRO</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n",
