class=\"mw-content-ltr mw-parser-output\" lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><p>Sentinel Falls is an easily accessible canyon that drains from the west side of Sentinel Rock to the floor of Yosemite Valley. Being that it does not drain a significant area, it is not polished in the way that is characteristic of many other canyons in the Sierras. As a result, in a normal snow year it has the potential to be runnable earlier in the season than other Yosemite canyons such as Middle Earth. Conversely, there are a number of rope pull hazards throughout the canyon as well as talus fields that must be downclimbed. All in all, this is a very fun, technical, and challenging canyon that has many great rappels, including the fantastic 530' foot drop from the main fall that ends the canyon.\n<\/p><p><br \/>\n<b>Flow<\/b>\n<\/p><p>Due to the massive lengths of these drops (mainly the last one), it is discouraged to do this canyon in high or possibly even moderate flow. In addition to the height of the drops, high and moderate flows can possibly put some of the anchor stations in the flow, reducing the amount of purchase on leges with anchors. It is recommended to check the CFS of the Merced river \"<a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https:\/\/waterdata.usgs.gov\/usa\/nwis\/uv?11266500\">11266500 MERCED R A POHONO BRIDGE NR YOSEMITE CA<\/a>\" This gauge read 190 CFS when it was done by our group and we collectively concluded that the flow at this level posed no significant safety issue in and of itself for a moderate or experienced canyoneer.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p><b>Shuttle<\/b>\n<\/p><p>Although it would be possible to do this without a shuttle by hiking up 4 Mile Trail, the ideal way to do this is to drop a car in the valley at the 4 mile trailhead near  37°44'1.88\"N, 119°36'6.66\"W then drive to the the Sentinel Dome trailhead at  37°42'44.56\"N, 119°35'11.20\"W.

At least one party arrived at the ultimate rappel to find that the rock which previously contained the bolts was completely missing (they were thankfully equipped with a hand bolting kit, quick links, plenty of webbing, etc). The understanding and use of ghosting techniques is highly recommended; R1 should likely be ghosted to not present an attractive nuisance for hikers.\n<\/p><p>Rappels in the upper part of the canyon possess a great threat of sticking a rope, in particular R1-R4. This is where the canyon is at its most narrow point, and although many rappels are on slabs, there are boulders, cracks, horns, and other obstacles of which to be mindful. Historically a group has stuck a rope in a crack on R3 and had to cut it; rappels throughout the canyon require attention as there are rope eating cracks and you are often tempted to combine multiple stages to avoid building anchors for extra nuisance rappels.\n<\/p><p>This canyon is often a good candidate for ghosting techniques throughout the canyon if run in normal flows; this will help in many cases with rope pull.\n<\/p><p><b>R1<\/b> - 100’. There are a number of trees that can be used as an anchor. It is very important to ghost this drop as to not encourage hikers in the area to enter the watercourse. The rappel is down a 45 degree slab and will end in a hallway canyon right. Be sure not to rappel past the R2 anchor, as this can easily lead to sticking a rope at the hallway.\n<\/p><p><b>R2<\/b> - 100’ - There is a chockstone in the bottom of the hallway that is about 4’ under where you get off rope. The anchor we used is here. The canyon continues a 45 degree slope and stair steps down polished rock. There are potential obstacles here for a rope to get stuck during a pull. In low flow, this may be downclimbable DCL for a moderately experienced canyoneer.\n<\/p><p><b>R3<\/b> - 240’ (approximate) - Anchor is a bolt and a nut canyon left. If flow is present, you will get wet on this one as well as the next. This is the first vertical rappel of the canyon and ends at a small ledge. The first descent party stuck a rope in a crack on this drop and were unable to retrieve it. Note: this rappel is appreciably longer than 200' and requires a longer rope if completion in one pitch is desired. Alternately, rappel approximately 170' to an intermediate ledge and rig R3(b) - 70' (approximate) from a webbing anchor canyon left of a small pothole, then continue to the R4 anchors.\n<\/p><p><b>R4<\/b> - 130’ (approximate) Anchor is in a hallway canyon left.
