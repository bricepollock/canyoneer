Traversing the canyon provides quite a different perspective from most visitors who peer down at the pinnacles from viewpoints on the canyon rim.  One of the most bizarre \/ unique things about visiting this canyon are the fist-sized rocks floating by in the creek.

Head downstream, wading right in the creek.  Potentially a few minor obstacles along the way, but nothing too challenging.  Rope not required.  The stream meanders quite a lot, so it can be easier to leave the creek occasionally to take a direct route.  Into mid-summer there can be giant blocks of snow lying in the creek.  Early season photos show the snow carving tunnels under the snowpack;  bring a helmet and use caution.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Once past the main area of hoodoo pinnacles, note a steep forested slope DCR.
