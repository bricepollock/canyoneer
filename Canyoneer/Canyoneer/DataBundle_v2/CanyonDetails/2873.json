class=\"mw-content-ltr mw-parser-output\" lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><p>This is a coastal sandstone canyon that has flowing water for most of the year, sometimes even in summer. With outstanding ocean views and scenic hanging pools and moss gardens, this canyon is a jewel in the middle of the city. It makes for a perfect adventure for beginners, urban explorers and adventurous kids that are not afraid of heights. Sandtrap can be combined with nearby Sandstone canyon, that although not as good is still well worth a visit.\n<\/p><p>WARNING: Sandstone cliffs are dangerous! The soft rock can break out and collapse without warning. They are especially dangerous after rains. If you venture along the cliffs use extreme caution and do so at your own risk.\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>To access the canyon drive to the Torrey Pines Glider Port, follow Torrey Pines Scenic Drive all the way to the end into a dirt parking lot where parking is both legal and free. Park near the tower.  \n<\/p>\n<ul><li>In visiting in 2016 there were a number of shady-looking characters who appeared to be casing our vehicle.  Might recommend parking down the south end where there's less likelihood of a car break-in.<\/li><\/ul>\n<p>The trail down to Sandtrap starts right at the edge of the fence. Take the trail that skirts outside the golf course fence and aim directly for the antenna tower at first, but once in the vicinity of the antenna proceed past it for some distance and when you reach some bigger trees drop down towards the canyon following a use trail. If you follow the right trail, you will reach a small metal gate with dense manzanita trees all around it, turn downhill into a tunnel carved in the manzanita forest and follow it to a wooden shack. At the shack drop down the drainage and follow it to the confluence with Sandtrap canyon. \n<\/p><p>Note that there are several cliff trails that crisscross the manzanita forests and to find the right one may be a little difficult. Some trails will cliff out, others will allow you to drop into the canyon, but if you drop in too early you will miss some of the more fun downclimbs, if you drop in too late you will face a horrible river bushwack. If you decide to proceed along the edge of the golf course for some of the approach please be extremely considerate towards the golf course operation:\n<\/p>\n<ul><li>hike on the edge of the greens and make sure to stay off the grass<\/li>\n<li>if any golfers are playing in the vicinity wait for them to move on<\/li>\n<li>if you meet any people along the way be courteous<\/li><\/ul>\n<p>If you want to go straight to the technical section you can take a clearly marked shortcut down from the parking lot straight to the top of the waterfall.  <i>(Dec 2016:  the bottom of the direct trail has been washed out.  You may need to rappel to get into the creek.)<\/i>\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Sandtrap has an optional 100' multistage rappel, but all drops can be easily bypassed by side trails. Some route finding might be necessary, sometimes there are carved steps in the sandstone that provide a way along the cliffs albeit with some exposure.\n<\/p><p>Those that choose to do the technical rappel should execute the route top-down and note that the access can be expedited from the parking lot to the top of the falls by an alternate approach. At the top of the multistage rappel, a tree branch located DCL in the shape of a semi-circle can be used as a natural anchor. A meat anchor could also work (use backups as necessary). Those that choose the non-technical route from the bottom-up will have fun facing a team challenge of climbing up the waterfalls. Bringing some webbing will assist with any climbs or exposed areas.\n<\/p><p>Sandtrap canyon can be combined with nearby Sandstone canyon. In this case it's recommended to go down Sandtrap canyon first, then go for a swim in the ocean to dust off, then walk along the beach (beware of nudists) and proceed up Sandstone canyon back to the parking lot. Along the way you will reach the tallest part of the cliffs, a dirt platform with sweeping ocean views from North to South, that makes for a perfect sunset dinner spot (if the weather is good).\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>There are two beach accesses at both sides of the glider port, the north side is more difficult, the south side is more developed with stairs and paved in some spots. \n<\/p><p>You can use either of these two routes to access\/exit the two canyons but is much more fun to combine them and go down Sandtrap canyon and up Sandstone canyon.\n<\/p><p>If you have time, you can explore the beautiful Black's Beach. Black Rock lies at the north side and Scripps Peer south.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Red_tape\">Red tape<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>A sign at the end of the canyon where it opens to the beach states that the canyon is closed to protect the sensitive habitat.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Beta_sites\">Beta sites<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media<\/h2><\/div>\n<ul><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/media\/set\/?set=a.10152557606346103.1073741897.669366102&amp;type=1&amp;l=4a55f8bc7b\">Sandtrap Canyon Facebook Album<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/media\/set\/?set=a.188824776102.153228.669366102&amp;type=1&amp;l=258c9f0e32\">Sandstone Canyon Facebook Album<\/a><\/li><\/ul>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Background\">Background<\/h2><\/div>\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nParsed by mw‐api‐ext.codfw.main‐6779cc57fc‐zgpcs\nCached time: 20240914191844\nCache expiry: 2592000\nReduced expiry: false\nComplications: [show‐toc]\nCPU time usage: 0.005 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.006 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 21\/1000000\nPost‐expand include size: 0\/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 0\/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 2\/100\nExpensive parser function count: 0\/500\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0\/20\nUnstrip post‐expand size: 0\/5000000 bytes\nNumber of Wikibase entities loaded: 0\/400\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%    0.000      1 -total\n-->\n<\/div>","rappelCountMax":1,"technicalRating":3,"rappelLongestMeters":24.38,"vehicle":"Passenger","shuttleSeconds":null,"waterRating":"A","url":"https:\/\/ropewiki.com\/Sandtrap_Canyon","name":"Sandtrap Canyon","permit":"Closed"}
