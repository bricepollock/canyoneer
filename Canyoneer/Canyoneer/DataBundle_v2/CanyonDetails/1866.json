Without the rappels, every local person within 50 miles would be coming here on weekends to do this amazing stretch of canyon. It has spectacular sustained narrows and fantastic rock formations with crystal clear (but cold) water.  There are a lots of swimming pools, jumping from logs into pools, and jumping from cliffs into pools.  While it does not have thrilling rappels, it's another Oregon gem and makes for a fun, relaxing day out. Excellent for beginners and really fun for experts as well.\n<\/p><p>Be aware:  Quartzville Creek is a big drainage and sees high flow in the early season.  Once into the gorge, the creek narrows up significantly and could be quite dangerous in high water.  Use caution before entering.  The flow becomes more moderate later in the season and should be beginner-friendly in July-September.\n<\/p>\n<ul><li>A good checkpoint for waterflow reference photos is probably a shot of Quartzville Creek taken at the bridge about 0.5mi downstream of the exit parking.<\/li>\n<li>There is a lot of swimming and water can be cold, even in August.

If you reach the bridge crossing Quartzville Creek, you've gone too far (athough this can also be your exit, adding about 0.5mi of enjoyable pool splashing).
