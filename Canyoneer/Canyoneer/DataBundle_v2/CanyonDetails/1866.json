  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>This is an incredibly fun canyon filled with exciting jumping\nopportunities and a couple short rappels. Without the rappels, every\nlocal person within 50 miles would be coming here on weekends to do this\namazing stretch of canyon. It has spectacular sustained narrows and\nfantastic rock formations with crystal clear (but cold) water. There are\na lots of swimming pools, jumping from logs into pools, and jumping from\ncliffs into pools. While it does not have thrilling rappels, it's\nanother Oregon gem and makes for a fun, relaxing day out. Excellent for\nbeginners and really fun for experts as well.</p>\n<p>Be aware: Quartzville Creek is a big drainage and sees high flow in\nthe early season. Once into the gorge, the creek narrows up\nsignificantly and could be quite dangerous in high water. Use caution\nbefore entering. The flow becomes more moderate later in the season and\nshould be beginner-friendly in July-September.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A good checkpoint for waterflow reference photos is probably a shot\nof Quartzville Creek taken at the bridge about 0.5mi downstream of the\nexit parking.</li>\n<li>There is a lot of swimming and water can be cold, even in August.\nBring adequate thermal protection.</li>\n<li>Quartzville can be combined with nearby <a href=\"Parkett_Creek\"\ntitle=\"wikilink\">Parkett Creek</a> or <a href=\"Lost_Creek\"\ntitle=\"wikilink\">Lost Creek</a> for a full day's adventure. Also check\nout the nearby <a href=\"South_Santiam_River\" title=\"wikilink\">South\nSantiam River</a>. No rappels but a similar flavor to Quartzville.</li>\n<li>Watershed: 20.5mi^2.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<h3 id=\"directions_lower_parking\">Directions: Lower Parking</h3>\n<p>From Marion Forks, head south on Hwy 22 for 2.9mi. Turn off\nright/west onto Straight Creek Road, aka NF-11, aka Quartzville Scenic\nByway. Follow this for ~18mi to where it crosses Minniece Creek and\ncontinue south to a large pullout at a curve in the road above the\nconfluence of Minniece and Quartzville Creek. If you reach the bridge\ncrossing Quartzville Creek, you've gone too far (athough this can also\nbe your exit, adding about 0.5mi of enjoyable pool splashing). A GPS is\nhandy for identifying the correct location.</p>\n<h3 id=\"directions_upper_parking\">Directions: Upper Parking</h3>\n<p>You can shuttle or hike the road.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Helser Direct (Short Approach):</strong> Head back east on\nFR 11 for 1.2mi and find a place to park. There's room for a couple cars\noff the pavement. From the cars, head immediately south through the\ntrees on a moderately steep, easy bushwhack down into the creek.\nApproach takes all of 2-3min. Quartzville narrows up about 5min\ndownstream.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Original Beta (Long Approach):</strong> Head back east on FR\n11 for 1.9mi to a small pullout immediately west of a spot where a dry\ncreek crosses the road, and the vegetation yields to a rocky slope. Upon\nreaching the creek, follow it downstream. Quartzville is your typical\nstreamwalk for about 30-40min (1mi) until it narrows up. There are\noccasional pools and short sections of interesting bedrock along the\nway.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"entering_the_creek\">Entering the Creek</h3>\n<p>It's recommended to put on wetsuits and harnesses on the road, as the\napproach to the water is less than five minutes. This way you will not\neven need to bring backpacks on the descent, except for the person who\ncarries the rope, and another person with water/snacks for the\ngroup.</p>\n<h2 id=\"technical_notes\">Technical Notes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Groups should be familiar with how to rig unlinked bolts.\n<strong>Please do not add webbing or other connective material to\nthem.</strong>. Quartzville sees massive floods in the winter and early\nspring. Giant logs may appear and disappear from year to year. Any\nwebbing or connective material may present an opportunity to snag flood\ndebris getting washed down the canyon. The relentless force of the water\nleveraged against the bolts can weaken, damage, or even destroy the\nanchor.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Jumping into deep pools can be tremendous fun, but always send\nsomeone down first to check the depth and look for underwater obstacles\n(ex: underwater ledges, boulders, and impaling logs). Jumping is a\nleading cause of canyon injuries (i.e. broken ankles and legs). The\nbottom of Quartzville is a bad place to have an accident.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Beginners \"leading\" beginners is a common cause of canyon\naccidents.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>When the creek narrows up, you know you're entering the actual\ngorge.</p>\n<p>The rappels are all right near the start of the gorge. Evaluate flow\nconditions prior to entry as this area could be dangerous in high water\nconditions, and it's your last chance to escape upstream.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>R1: 15ft from unlinked bolts DCR.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>R2: 20ft from unlinked bolts DCR about 100' downstream of R1. Cross\na pool to R3.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>R3: 6ft from single glue-in bolt. (Update 2023: Bit bent from flood\ndamage, but still usable.)\n<ul>\n<li><strong>It looks inviting, but do NOT jump R3.</strong> The pool\nbelow is full of irregularly-shaped rocks hidden just under the surface.\nBreaking a leg in here would be a whole barrel of no fun.</li>\n<li>If the bolt at R3 is unusable, you'll likely need to extend the rope\nfrom R2. This requires about 60ft of rope (SRT) per the horizontal\ndistance. Be aware: this drop can be a rope-eater. Rappellers should\ntake special care to keep the rope from getting stuck in a crack on the\nDCR side of this drop.</li>\n<li>The signature photo for this page shows the R3 drop; R2 is just\nbehind it and around the corner to the left.</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Below R3: Swim out through the narrows. This is a fantastic place to\nswim and play, as well as stop for lunch! There is also a fun\nopportunity for a slide here into a pool, and climbing up on the cliffs\nDCL and jumping into the deep pools in the narrows.</p>\n<p>After R3, all other rappels are optional, but keep an eye out for\ngood jumping spots... there are quite a few. Folks who are not into\njumping may still want to rappel from the occasional log jam. Continue\ndownstream through the narrows with all manner of interesting rock\nformations, pools, and downclimbs. There are at least three places where\nyou can walk out on large logs and jump into pools. A giant undercut\ncarved out by extreme flooding (almost a cave) on DCL is a signal that\nthe end is drawing near. When you reach an obvious tributary entering\nDCR via a large bedrock ramp, this is Minniece Creek and your exit.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>Head up Minniece Creek for about 50ft and exit on a faint use trail\non climber's left. This leads directly up to the road and your parked\ncar. The exit hike takes all of two minutes. Alternately, you can\ncontinue downstream for another 0.5mi of enjoyable easy pools to the\nbridge crossing Quartzville Creek. If you accidentally pass Minniece\nCreek, just exit at the bridge. From here, there are many campsites\ndownstream along the creek.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<p>None.</p>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a\nhref=\"http://ropewiki.com/User:Super_Amazing_Map?id=Pure_Hate_Gorge_-_Oregon\">Super\nAmazing Map</a> : Pure Hate Gorge</li>\n<li><a\nhref=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20210527212206/www.canyoneeringnorthwest.com/Quartzville/Quartzville_Creek.php\">CanyoneeringNorthwest.com\n(archive.org)</a> : Quartzville Creek</li>\n<li><a\nhref=\"http://www.oregonkayaking.net/creeks/uu_qville/uu_qville.html\">Kayaking\nQuartzville Creek</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n<p>The name \"Pure Hate Gorge\" was given to this section of the creek by\nwhitewater kayakers disappointed with conditions within.
