  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>Lower Buck Canyon has the sort of classic bedrock gorge one might\nhope for in the Sierra. Out of Lower Buck Canyon, Upper Buck Canyon,\nLone Pine Creek, this canyon offers the longest technical section,\njumps, slides, and the most fun. It would be the only one of the three\nworth doing on it's own, as with a shuttle, it could be done in two\ndays. Still, I wouldn't recommend that approach.</p>\n<p>Instead combine it as a backcountry trip with Lone Pine Creek, and\nUpper Buck Canyon. If you did a shuttle (though you'd have to get all\nyour gear through Lower Buck Canyon) you could also end your trip\nthrough Panther Creek Gorge on the middle fork, which would be a great\nend for an epic adventure.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>From the High Sierra Trail, boulder hop down Buck Creek. The bouldery\nsection goes for a long ways, but is fairly enjoyable if you're into\nthat sort of thing. As you pass under Sugarbowl Dome up to your left\n(hard to spot through the trees) you'll come to the technical section.\nThis starts with a large sliding waterfall that drops in total probably\naround a hundred feet and can be bypassed on the right. Even if you skip\nthis, some little slides in the canyon will likely soon draw you into\nthe water.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>Jumps rappels and swims follow through a green, vegetated gorge.\nAfter this first section you will see the West wall rise way up in front\nof you as you enter a deeper gorge with some fantastic waterfalls. A\ncouple tributaries come in from the right to add flow. The crux of the\ncanyon happens here, where a double drop is necessitated (unless you\nhave a bolt kit) from a tree on the left, and down to the right. This\nwill put you rappelling down a crack under the full force of the second\ndrop. If flows are too high, you would likely need to bolt, or bypass\nthis through the steep woods on the left, which looks not unreasonable,\nbut not particularly pleasant.</p>\n<p>A great slide follows, and another falls which can be bypassed on the\nright. Further down is an almost awesome slide, but a rock crease makes\nit look fairly painful, and a short rappel on the left is a better\noption. A final drop that falls 20 feet landing just in front of a\nboulder can be downclimbed on the left. The Middle Fork Trail bridge\nlays just downstream.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>If you're doing this as a loop, head left up the Middle Fork Trail\nand enjoy the 5 miles and 2800 feet of climbing back up to Bearpaw\nMeadow!</p>\n<p>Otherwise, turn right and head downstream. Panther Creek is about 6\nmiles downstream if you're finishing down the gorge. You will probably\nwant to camp in between rather than attempt both canyons in the same\nday.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<p>You'll need a backcountry permit for the trip</p>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n",
