  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>Little Goose Creek is a fun canyon in Gifford Pinchot National\nForest. Although it is not very technically difficult, the canyon is\nquite scenic. There are at least two rappels, although you may end out\ndoing more depending on water level and your comfort. There are many\ncascades that can be downclimbed, wading, and a few short swims. Full\nwetsuit required. Creek seems to sport reasonably high water into\nAugust. The creek was still cold in mid-late August 2017, suggesting it\nmay be spring-fed.</p>\n<p>Expect to encounter non-canyoneer hikers at the upper falls on summer\nweekends. There is an unofficial trail that follows along the south rim\nof the canyon providing access to the bottom of R1 and R2. Adventurous\nhikers may sometimes descend to the top of the narrows.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>For a longer full day adventure, combine with <a\nhref=\"http://ropewiki.com/Mosquito_Creek_(Gifford_Pinchot_NF)\">Mosquito\nCreek</a> just up the road.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>Parking options:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>There is a small pullout on the east side of FR 88 just south of the\nbridge over Little Goose Creek. This pullout can accommodate one\ncar.</li>\n<li>About 300ft south of the bridge on the west side of FR88 is a small\nspur road / dispersed camping site with plenty of room for a few\nvehicles.</li>\n<li>A few hundred yards further is a spur road branching off to the\nsouthwest with plenty of room on the shoulder for parking.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>From the pullout above, follow a user trail into the forest along the\nsouth side of the creek. Go a few hundred feet and locate a steep dirty\nscramble trail (scramble down or rappel) that drops immediately into the\ndrainage below the bridge. R1 is a few minutes walk downstream.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>R1 - 15ft.</li>\n<li>R2 <em>Little Goose Falls</em> - 60ft. Large plunge-pool at the base\nmay contain hydraulics in high flow. Anchor off a boulder mid-creek, or\nuse a tree DCR to rappel out of the flow and evade the pool. Beware\nrockfall hazard on the dry rap.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Expect a long stream walk with much tedious rock-hopping below R2.\nThere are some interesting columnar basalt formations on the north side\nof the canyon. Keep heading downstream through a number of short\ndownclimbs.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>First significant obstacle below R2 is a 30ft low-angle ramp.\nDownclimb carefully or rappel. Rappelling might be safer if wet &amp;\nslippery.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>20ft two tier ramp with a hanging pool between. Pool is deep\n(swimmer) and may have a hydraulic in high flow. There is a cave-like\nspace DCL of the pool. Slide down the first tier DCR and downclimb the\nsecond tier DCR. There is another short swimmer at the bottom. A\ntributary enters DCR at the bottom.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>After what seems like much walking, the nature of the creek suddenly\nchanges as it drops into a tight narrows. Use caution as the area ahead\ncould be dangerous in high water conditions. Escape would be very\ndifficult within the narrows. There are two obstacles immediately\nahead:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>1) 12ft ramp marks the entrance to the narrows.</li>\n<li>2) Immediately below the 12ft ramp, the creek turns right and goes\nover a 35ft drop (R3). There is a short swimmer at the bottom and the\ncreek drops over a final 2ft step at the very bottom. Beware potential\nhydraulic below the 35ft step.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Low or Moderate Flow:</strong> Downclimb the 12ft ramp DCR,\ncross the watercourse and rappel from a rootball (DCL) wedged atop the\n35ft drop.</p>\n<p><strong>High Flow:</strong> Climb up 20-30ft DCR on a mini-ridge and\nrappel from a tree (50ft) to bypass both obstacles.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ahead, the narrows swings left to the top of a 20ft ramp. Downclimb\ncarefully DCR or rappel from a log. At the bottom is a deep plunge pool\n(swimmer) which may have some current. Beware a couple of logs wedged\nout in the middle of the pool as the current may sweep you into\nthem.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Exit the pool and make your way down through a beautiful section of\nnarrows with a few more easy downclimbs to eventually reach the\nconfluence with Trout Lake Creek.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>On reaching the confluence with Trout Lake Creek, the flow triples.\nContinue downstream another 100ft or so. There might be an easier way\nout further downstream(?), but we exited DCR directly up a steep\nforested slope bearing slightly climber's right on the ascent to detour\naround a cliff band.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Just to climber's left on the same set of cliffs is a small cave;\nperhaps 20ft deep. Bear prints were found in the wet dirt inside the\ncave in Aug 2017.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Continue your way up generally open forested slopes for several\nhundred vertical feet. We followed an old trail (elk trail) along the\nnorth edge of a clear cut, but instead of following trails all the way\nback to the bridge as described in the original beta, we pushed on up\nalong the west side of the clear cut and exited to FR88. Easy hike back\nalong the road.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<p>None.</p>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><img src=\"rwl_en.png\" title=\"rwl_en.png\" alt=\"rwl_en.png\" /><a\nhref=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20210527212206/www.canyoneeringnorthwest.com/LittleGooseCreek/Little_Goose_Creek.php\">CanyoneeringNorthwest.com\n(archive.org)</a> : Little Goose Creek</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<p><a\nhref=\"https://youtu.be/pvKm6-3R3rU\">https://youtu.be/pvKm6-3R3rU</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n",
