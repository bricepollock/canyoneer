  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>A deep and narrow slot. Ghosting (toggle &amp; sand trap) or natural\nanchors.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>Use the long approach for Headless Duck. Please follow the well\ndefined path leading through the hoodoos. Careless footprints have\nnegatively impacted the \"crypto-cactus gardens\".</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>Only one or possibly two rappels. Generally easy and secure\ndownclimbs. Be aware that one is very skinny and if you have to go\nhigher to fit you might get into X territory.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n<p>I first descended this canyon about twenty years ago. On that trip we\nfound an old webbing anchor showing that the canyon has been visited for\na while. A local said they call the formation at the head of the canyon\nthe \"Tilted Teepees\", so that's the name I've used. We've since been\ncollectively referring to the canyons on the King bench as the\nTransformer slots since in many of them there is \"more than meets the\neye\".</p>\n",
