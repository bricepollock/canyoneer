Currently there are no online posting\nthat can be found regarding this continuation of closure and both online\nand physical posts may show up at different times so always check for\nboth. It may take a few days from now for any of these orders to show up\nin public. Fines were verbally expressed upon violation by the Ranger on\nsite. If and when the physical post is published on location a photo of\nit should be posted here.</p>\n<p><strong>10-26-2017</strong> - Contacted Mill Creek Ranger Station and\nthey confirmed that Big Falls can now be descended.</p>\n<p>Big Falls is a series of 2 large waterfalls in the San Bernardino\nMountains. Although given an A rating, the flow for these are some of\nthe highest you'll find year round in Southern California. Wetsuits or\nwaterproof jackets are typically required in winter and spring due to\nthe cold water temperature and alpine location.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>Hwy 38 east from Redlands, fork right onto Valley of the Falls Road,\ndrive through the hamlet of Forest Falls. Just past the ranger shack in\nthe road make a left into the Big Falls Parking lot and park here. The\ntrail begins on the north side of the lot heading west.</p>\n<p>Take the Big Falls Trail from the parking lot to the usual tourist\noverlook. After crossing Mill Creek (currently a dry riverbed but it has\nbeen known in wetter years to be a swift and tricky river crossing) and\nupon reaching the mouth of the canyon proceed to the viewing platform (a\nmetal fence from where people look at the falls) by following a trail on\nthe east side of the canyon. The platform is not a good checkpoint from\nwhere to inspect the water flow because the lower fall is not visible,\nso it is better to proceed ahead for a little distance till the lower\nfall comes in full view. Alternatively you can also check flow once on\nthe ridge hike.</p>\n<p>After checking water flow retrace your steps (go back towards the\nmouth of the canyon) to about 150ft downstream from the viewing platform\nand cross the river. Look for a climbing trail that starts between two\nlarge trees on the west side of the canyon and follow this trail all the\nway up to the top of the ridge. It's a steep, somewhat loose approach,\nbut it's easily managed and will save hours and unnecessary elevation\ngain compared to any other approach route. Staying close to the cliff\nside next to the canyon you will find a faint use trail. When you reach\nthe top of the ridge you will find a well worn trail to drop into the\ncanyon putting you at the top of rap 1. <strong>IMPORTANT: Do not try to\nclimb the canyon walls upstream from the viewing platform, these routes\nare EXPOSED and DANGEROUS, several people have been killed trying to\nfree climb these crumbling walls.</strong></p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>As of Winter 2019 the canyon center (between R1 and R2) has totally\nchanged. All the dirt and talus rocks have been swept away. The huge\nboulder RDC for R2 is gone. R1 is still off the same big tree, but the\ndrop length is now 170 feet with no option to make it shorter by angling\nright at the bottom to hit the high dirt ground. There is now a large\nlog wedged across the canyon at the top of R1, which is easy enough to\nclimb over and does not seem to cause any rope pull issues. The high\nanchor point on the big tree provides easy pull. The plumb line from\nthis tree will soon move you out of water course onto a slick rock face\nRDC. In high flow, the tricky part is relatively short, a bit below the\nbig log where you have no choice but go through heavy water flow.\nTouchdown is at the edge of the pool.</p>\n<p>R1 can be rigged LDC either off a reasonable bush or rock horn. You\nhave to cross the stream up high and traverse out onto the exposed\nskinny ledge to reach these anchor points. These anchor points keep you\nout of the water course initially, but soon you will be in the full\nbrunt of it midway to mostly down. This good fun in low flow, but could\nbe dangerous in high flow. Normally no webbing will be found at either\nof these locations, so you will have to build your own anchor here.</p>\n<p>Winter 2019 storms swept away the old R2 anchor boulder and all the\nother rocks and dirt mid canyon. R2 is now webbing looped around a\nburied rock RDC that is approximately where the old boulder anchor was\nlocated, but vertically lower. This anchor has a courtesy rappel point\n(red webbing at 115 feet) and an extended rappel point (tan webbing 100\nfeet). The courtesy rappel point is easy and safe for people to get onto\nrappel (unlike the old boulder), but the rope pull (even with no block\nor knot) is so bad that you cannot retrieve your rope. So the last\nperson needs to use the extended rappel point, which requires rappelling\nto that point, then changing the rope anchor point. There is a\nreasonable ledge for standing at the extended point, but it's dangerous\nto stand there without being connected to the extended anchor with a\nsafety tether. From this anchor, the rappel skirts the edge of the water\nflow (high flow) so it's generally easy to get to the bottom without\nbeing hammered by water too much.</p>\n<p>R2 can be rigged with webbing around a large boulder centered in the\nwater course. This will put you into the main brunt of the waterfall,\nwhich like R1, is good fun in low flow, but could be dangerous in high\nflow.</p>\n<p>The water temperature is quite cold for SoCal, and canyoneers have\nexperienced \"brain freeze\" with the water pounding on their exposed\nnecks even using wetsuits. A wetsuit hood is HIGHLY recommended!</p>\n<p><a\nhref=\"File:BigFallsR1LowFlow.jpg%7CFirst\">File:BigFallsR1LowFlow.jpg|First</a>\nrappel, 170' off a high anchor on a solid tree RDC into the pool (Note:\nwinter 2019 removed all the dirt and rocks for the shorter 150 to 160\nfeet rappel option) <a\nhref=\"File:BigFallsR2LowFlow.jpg%7CSecond\">File:BigFallsR2LowFlow.jpg|Second</a>\nrappel, 115' from new 2019 courtesy rappel point RDC (Note: that a 200ft\ndouble strand rope will make the bottom from the extended rappel point,\nbut not from the courtesy point)</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>A short and easy scramble RDC.
