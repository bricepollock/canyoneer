We all need to help with trail and canyon maintenance on every trip.<\/b> \n<\/p><p>“Baby Colby” is a tributary of the well known Colby Canyon and the waterfall is right at the beginning of the entry\/exit trail to Colby on your left side. This waterfall is also known as R11 of \"Brennen Canyon\". It’s a super short canyon, but worth it for:<br \/>\n1. First time or Beginner canyoneers - A great spot to experience and practice your canyoneering skills.<br \/>\n2. Nicely setup to practice the technical side of a multi-pitch rappelling without the distractions of long-hikes, height and discomfort while hanging (there’s a nice ledge to stand on).\n<\/p><p>Evidence shows that it was once bolted by rock climbers for 2 pitch lead-climbing. The bolts at the very top are in good shape, however when I did it with the kids in June 2019 I saw the condition of the bolts in the middle and had to go back and replace them on 11,16,2019.

I then saw the condition of the bolts in the middle and decided to go back and replace them. That happened on 11,16,2019.\nAs you can see in the pictures below, whoever placed these bolts put them right in the course of every rock that is flying down the waterfall during a flood. As a result both bolts: 1. got flattened by the rocks, and 2. The bolts even started to get pulled out of the rock.\nOn top of that, since the pool was full of water that day, we had to do some nice acrobatics to get around it dry to the belay station.\nWhen I went to replace the bolts, I also learned (with help from my hammer) that the rock they bolted into is all hollow.\nWhile I wasn't able to pull the old bolts out (and will have to go back better equipped to do that), I did install a new 2 bolt belay station on the other side of the pool where there's a nice ledge to stand on and where I believe they will not get hit by flying rocks. We'll find out after the next winter...\n<\/p><p>Rock Climbing:<br \/>\nEither water and rock or (more likely) someone pulled the bolts that were installed for lead-climbing out. However, they took the bolt hangers and left the sleeves in the rock, so you can now see a bunch of rusty circles where they were.\nSince it looks like a nice 5.7-5.8, it is my intention to go back and re-bolt this to have a nice place to teach my kids and others lead-climbing.\n<\/p>\n<link rel=\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\" href=\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1062633282\"> \n<div class=\"thumb tright\">\n<div style=\"display:table;\">\n<span class=\"mw-default-size\" typeof=\"mw:Error mw:File\/Frameless\">\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<link rel=\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\" href=\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1062633282\"> \n<div class=\"thumb tright\">\n<div style=\"display:table;\">\n<span class=\"mw-default-size\" typeof=\"mw:Error mw:File\/Frameless\">\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<link rel=\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\" href=\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1062633282\"> \n<div class=\"thumb tright\">\n<div style=\"display:table;\">\n<span class=\"mw-default-size\" typeof=\"mw:Error mw:File\/Frameless\">\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<link rel=\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\" href=\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1062633282\"> \n<div class=\"thumb tright\">\n<div style=\"display:table;\">\n<span class=\"mw-default-size\" typeof=\"mw:Error mw:File\/Frameless\">\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<link rel=\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\" href=\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1062633282\"> \n<div class=\"thumb tright\">\n<div style=\"display:table;\">\n<span class=\"mw-default-size\" typeof=\"mw:Error mw:File\/Frameless\">\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Background\">Background<\/h2><\/div>\n\n\n<\/div>","months":[],"rappelLongestMeters":27.43,"name":"Baby Colby Canyon","longitude":-118.1393,"riskRating":null,"waterRating":"A","rappelCountMax":2,"id":57315,"latitude":34.2708,"quality":3,"version":"f6a19ade0df01d2aae6000db951c2a81375cb5f722652998d82165a7d794bd19","url":"https:\/\/ropewiki.com\/Baby_Colby_Canyon","shuttleSeconds":null,"rappelCountMin":1,"permit":"No","vehicle":"Passenger","technicalRating":3,"timeRating":"I","geojson":{"type":"FeatureCollection","features":[{"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[[-118.1392754,34.2707582,0]]},"properties":{"name":"2 Tier Waterfall - 25' \/ 65' - 2 Bolts Each"},"type":"Feature"},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"name":"5' Downclimb"},"geometry":{"coordinates":[[-118.1390457,34.271553,0]],"type":"Point"}},{"geometry":{"coordinates":[[-118.1390457,34.2714195,0]],"type":"Point"},"properties":{"name":"5' Downclimb"},"type":"Feature"},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[[-118.1407072,34.2696762,0]]},"properties":{"name":"Parking"}},{"properties":{"name":"Trailhead"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[[-118.1406764,34.2697593,0]]}},{"properties":{"name":"Drop in"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[[-118.1396225,34.2717402,0]]}},{"geometry":{"coordinates":[[-118.1406587,34.2697739,0],[-118.1406136,34.2698412,0],[-118.1405578,34.2698974,0],[-118.14051,34.27,0],[-118.1404989,34.2701533,0],[-118.14041,34.2703,0],[-118.1402367,34.2703431,0],[-118.140205,34.27039,0],[-118.1401595,34.2704581,0],[-118.1401529,34.2705374,0],[-118.1401667,34.2705956,0],[-118.1401324,34.2706247,0],[-118.140023,34.2706173,0],[-118.1399891,34.2706752,0],[-118.13999,34.270813,0],[-118.1399479,34.2708523,0],[-118.139725,34.27096,0],[-118.1398589,34.2711746,0],[-118.1398927,34.2712693,0],[-118.1398299,34.2713451,0],[-118.1397643,34.2714175,0],[-118.1396987,34.2714606,0],[-118.1397424,34.2715871,0],[-118.1396632,34.2716311,0],[-118.13962,34.27173,0],[-118.1395313,34.2717149,0],[-118.1394725,34.2716909,0],[-118.1394673,34.2716181,0],[-118.1392819,34.2716002,0],[-118.1391231,34.2715698,0],[-118.1390524,34.2715804,0],[-118.13903,34.27155,0],[-118.139015,34.2714,0],[-118.1390593,34.2711817,0],[-118.1391607,34.2711156,0],[-118.1392782,34.2710717,0],[-118.1392051,34.2710192,0],[-118.13916,34.270985,0],[-118.13917,34.270943,0],[-118.13919,34.27091,0],[-118.13923,34.27083,0],[-118.1392635,34.2706673,0],[-118.1392798,34.2705616,0],[-118.1393616,34.2705649,0],[-118.1394608,34.2705638,0],[-118.1395386,34.2705505,0],[-118.1396057,34.2705184,0],[-118.1396244,34.2704474,0],[-118.1397438,34.2704009,0],[-118.139886,34.2702923,0],[-118.140012,34.2702114,0],[-118.1400777,34.2701316,0],[-118.1401837,34.2700839,0],[-118.1403111,34.2700075,0],[-118.1403513,34.2699254,0],[-118.1404465,34.2698878,0],[-118.1405485,34.2698911,0],[-118.1406035,34.2698301,0],[-118.1406356,34.2697636,0]],"type":"LineString"},"properties":{"name":"Baby Colby Canyon - Actual","stroke":"#0000ff"},"type":"Feature"}]}}
