We all need to help\nwith trail and canyon maintenance on every trip.</strong></p>\n<p>“Baby Colby” is a tributary of the well known Colby Canyon and the\nwaterfall is right at the beginning of the entry/exit trail to Colby on\nyour left side. This waterfall is also known as R11 of Brennen Canyon.\nIt’s a super short canyon, but worth it for:<br />\n1. First time canyoneers - A great spot to experience and practice\ncanyoneering for first timers.<br />\n2. Nicely setup to practice the technical side of a multi-pitch\nrappelling without the distractions of distance, much height and\ndiscomfort while hanging (there’s a nice shelf to stand on).</p>\n<p>Evidence shows that it was once bolted by rock climbers for 2 pitch\nlead-climbing. The bolts at the very top are in good shape, however when\nI did it with the kids in June 2019 I saw the condition of the bolts in\nthe middle and had to go back and replace them. That happened today\n(11,16,2019). See more under \"Trip reports and media\"</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>Getting There: From the 210 Freeway take exit 20 for “CA-2/Angeles\nCrest Hwy” toward La Cañada, Flintridge. Drive 10 miles on the Angeles\nCrest Hwy to the trailhead and parking lot on the left (north) side of\nthe road. Entering “Colby Canyon Trailhead” on Google maps will take you\nright to the parking, or enter: 34.269683, -118.140695</p>\n<p>Approach: Short class 2-3 approach with a little scrambling to the\ndrop in point. Watch your step from the drop in point to the bottom of\nthe canyon! I’ve done a little trail-work there but much more is\nneeded.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>The Canyon: Once on the canyon floor, you will pass two 5’\ndown-climbs and get to the main waterfall. The entire thing is about 90’\nand you can do it in one rappel. However, if you want to practice your\nmulti-pitch rappel skills, there’s a 2 bolt belay station in the\nmiddle.</p>\n<p>Waterfalls:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr class=\"header\">\n<th><p>Number</p></th>\n<th><p>Tiers</p></th>\n<th><p>Total height</p></th>\n<th><p>Anchor (looking down stream)</p></th>\n<th><p>Anchor Gear</p></th>\n<th><p>Rope*</p></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td><p>1</p></td>\n<td><p>2</p></td>\n<td><p>25’+65’</p></td>\n<td><p>R - 2 Bolts</p></td>\n<td><p>5-10’ Webbing or rope</p></td>\n<td><p>200’</p></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<ul>\n<li>Rope - Recommended length based on rappel height and distance\nbetween tiers (when applicable) and to anchors x 2</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Waterfall notes:<br />\n1. As mentioned above, can be done as one 90’ rappel of broken to 25’\nand 65’ rappels.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>From the bottom of the rappel it’s a very short walk back to the\ncar.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<p>On June 14, 2019 I took the kids to practice Multi-pitch rappel for\ntheir first time. I then saw the condition of the bolts in the middle\nand decided to go back and replace them. That happened today\n(11,16,2019). As you can see in the pictures below, whoever placed these\nbolts put them right in the course of every rock that is flying down the\nwaterfall during a flood. As a result both bolts: 1. got flattened by\nthe rocks, and 2. The bolts even started to get pulled out of the rock\nface. On top of that, since the pool was full of water that day, we had\nto do some nice acrobatics to get around it dry to the belay station.\nToday when I went with Gil to replace the bolts, I also learned (with\nhelp from my hammer) that the rock they bolted into is all hollow. While\nI wasn't able to pull the old bolts out (and will have to go back better\nequipped to do that), I did install a new 2 bolt belay station on the\nother side of the pool where there's a nice ledge to stand on and where\nI believe they will not get hit by flying rocks. We'll find out after\nthe next winter...</p>\n<p>Rock Climbing:<br />\nEither water and rock or (more likely) someone pulled the bolts that\nwere installed for lead-climbing out. However, they took the bolt\nhangers and left the sleeves in the rock, so you can now see a bunch of\nrusty circles where they were. Since it looks like a nice 5.7-5.8, it is\nmy intention to go back and re-bolt this as well to have a nice place to\nteach my kids lead-climbing as well.</p>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n",
