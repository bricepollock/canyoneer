  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>Battle Creek is a short, one and done rappel in the foothills of Utah\ncounty. It has an easy scramble to the top of the falls so it’s fast to\nrun laps. Great for beginners, or practicing.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>Park at the Battle Creek trailhead. Take the hiking trail until you\nsee the falls. There is a clear path that goes to the top of the\nfalls.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>Several trees at the top provide great locations for anchor building.\nThis is a popular hike. Be mindful of rockfall. Rappel with your rope\nand pull cord. Because there is so much traffic at the top of the falls\nit’s recommended that you take your webbing/anchor after you finish.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>Hike back the way you came</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><img src=\"rwl_en.png\" title=\"rwl_en.png\" alt=\"rwl_en.png\" /><a\nhref=\"http://roadtripryan.com/go/t/utah/wasatch/battle-creek\">RoadTripRyan.com</a>\n: Battle Creek Falls</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n",
