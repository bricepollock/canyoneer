class=\"mw-content-ltr mw-parser-output\" lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><p>Located near Redstone, Colorado, Bulldog Creek is a small tributary to Avalanche creek. Historically, the area has been associated with the Avalanche mining district, now part of the White River National Forest. Although the creek exists entirely on National Forest land, the M &amp; J claim along the creek is current. Avoid disturbing the old mining structures and tunnels or removing any minerals in the area.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>From Carbondale, drive south on highway 133 for about 12 miles until you reach Avalanche creek road. Drive about 1.7 miles till the road intersects Bulldog Creek at a water crossing. The trailhead starts just before the water crossing, on the north side of the road. Pull off parking can be found adjacent to the trailhead, as well as in a few spots in either direction on the road\n<\/p>\n<style data-mw-deduplicate=\"TemplateStyles:r1062633282\">@media all and (max-width:720px){.mw-parser-output .content .thumb>div:not(.thumbinner){display:flex;justify-content:center;flex-wrap:wrap;align-content:flex-start;flex-direction:column}}body.skin-vector .mw-parser-output div.thumb>div:not(.thumbinner){font-size:94%;text-align:center;overflow:hidden;min-width:100px}body.skin-minerva .mw-parser-output div.thumb>div:not(.thumbinner){margin:0 auto;max-width:100%!important}<\/style> \n<div class=\"thumb tright\">\n<div style=\"display:table;\">\n<span class=\"mw-default-size\" typeof=\"mw:Error mw:File\/Frameless\">\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p><b>On Foot:<\/b>\n<\/p><p>Depart Avalanche creek road, heading northeast. A well-defined trail follows closely to Bulldog Creek and eventually reaches an old abandoned mining structure. Past the mining structure, the trail crosses to the south side of the creek. A few social trails of varying quality exist heading north up the river. Take care to choose the most worn trail to avoid any additional excess erosion. The trail continues up the river until you reach an old abandoned mine. Soon after the mine you reach a waterfall, R8 of the canyon.  This serves as a good spot to gauge the water before continuing the approach.\n<\/p>\n<link rel=\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\" href=\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1062633282\"> \n<div class=\"thumb tright\">\n<div style=\"display:table;\">\n<span class=\"mw-default-size\" typeof=\"mw:Error mw:File\/Frameless\">\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>After viewing R8 just beyond the mine and at the junction of Bulldog Creek and an unnamed creek, which comes in from the right looking upstream, begin the approach by traveling upstream in the unnamed creek. Some small falls quickly block the ascent up the creek, but they can be easily bypassed on the south side. After bypassing the falls, continue up the creek for around another 1000 ft. You’ll pass an additional drainage which comes in from the right. A few hundred feet after, a faint trail to the left should appear, leading you to a large, abandoned mining structure. From here, make your way north towards Bulldog Creek. An outcropping by the creek serves as a vantage point for another large fall, R3.\n<\/p>\n<link rel=\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\" href=\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1062633282\"> \n<div class=\"thumb tright\">\n<div style=\"display:table;\">\n<span class=\"mw-default-size\" typeof=\"mw:Error mw:File\/Frameless\">\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>Continue working up the ridges of the mountain, occasionally departing the ridge to contour the mountain closer to the creek.
