If you like water parks with deep pools to jump into and sinewy narrows, this is the canyon for you. No doubt the funnest canyon on the island. 6 rappels plus 2 more if you are swimming out of the ocean.\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>The rocks are grippy even where they are covered in moss. There are several ideally shaped tobaggons but due to the lack of a slippery surface it is not possible to do so. In Sept. 2016 one canyoneer broke his leg in 3 places attempting to do so.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>There are two options. Before the final rappel into the ocean, take the use trail up on the right. It takes about 10 minutes to get to the hiker trail and another 20 minutes back to the car. The other option is to rappel into the ocean and swim to the left for 500 meters to a small pebble beach. You will want to leave a shuttle car if doing the swim exit. Also, the sea must be calm. If the tides are working against you and you are not an efficient swimmer, you could get carried out to sea in the middle of the Atlantic with little hope of rescue.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Red_tape\">Red tape<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Beta_sites\">Beta sites<\/h2><\/div>\n<ul><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http:\/\/descente-canyon.com\/canyoning\/canyon-description\/23062\">Descente-Canyon.com<\/a> &#160;: Ilhéus (inférior)<\/li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http:\/\/ropewiki.com\/User:Azores_Canyoning_Book?id=Ilhéus_Inf..\">Azores Canyoning Book by Desnivel<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http:\/\/canyon.carto.net\/cwiki\/bin\/view\/Canyons\/IlheusinferiorCanyon\">Canyon.Carto.net<\/a> &#160;: Ilhéus inferior<\/li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http:\/\/canyon.carto.net\/cwiki\/bin\/view\/Canyons\/IlheusmedCanyon\">Canyon.Carto.net<\/a> &#160;: Ilhéus medio<\/li><\/ul>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media<\/h2><\/div>\n<ul><li>Trip<\/li><\/ul>\n<p><br \/>\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Background\">Background<\/h2><\/div>\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nParsed by mw‐api‐ext.codfw.main‐6779cc57fc‐pwh8d\nCached time: 20240914191855\nCache expiry: 2592000\nReduced expiry: false\nComplications: [show‐toc]\nCPU time usage: 0.006 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.007 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 21\/1000000\nPost‐expand include size: 0\/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 0\/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 2\/100\nExpensive parser function count: 0\/500\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0\/20\nUnstrip post‐expand size: 0\/5000000 bytes\nNumber of Wikibase entities loaded: 0\/400\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%    0.000      1 -total\n-->\n<\/div>","rappelCountMin":6,"url":"https:\/\/ropewiki.com\/Ilheus_(Lower)","waterRating":"C1","months":[],"latitude":39.5029,"permit":"No","geojson":{"type":"FeatureCollection","features":[{"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[[-31.201,39.5029,0]]},"properties":{"name":"Start"},"type":"Feature"},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"name":"End"},"geometry":{"coordinates":[[-31.198526,39.506961,0]],"type":"Point"}},{"properties":{"name":"Descent"},"geometry":{"coordinates":[[-31.201028,39.50285,0],[-31.200985,39.502954,0],[-31.200534,39.503359,0],[-31.200211,39.503679,0],[-31.199867,39.504041,0],[-31.199603,39.504249,0],[-31.199612,39.504444,0],[-31.199732,39.504651,0],[-31.199753,39.504917,0],[-31.199867,39.505124,0],[-31.199789,39.505416,0],[-31.199489,39.505687,0],[-31.199019,39.505994,0],[-31.198897,39.506117,0],[-31.198744,39.506369,0],[-31.198587,39.506512,0],[-31.198511,39.506744,0],[-31.198526,39.506961,0]],"type":"LineString"},"type":"Feature"}]},"longitude":-31.201,"id":16110,"riskRating":null,"name":"Ilheus (Lower)","rappelLongestMeters":20,"quality":4.4,"rappelCountMax":6,"shuttleSeconds":null,"vehicle":null}
