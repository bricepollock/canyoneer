  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>A beautiful conglomerate canyon in the Los Padres National Forest. It\nstarts with an interesting slot canyon, followed by some down-climbs and\nshort rappels before it drops dramatically into Piru Creek. It's a\npretty unique canyon with narrow portions, interesting ledges, small\ncaves and potholes. Because of the long exit (10-11 miles) it is usually\ndone as a 2 day canyon trip, with a bivy in Piru Creek. It could be done\nin one long day, perhaps if you skip the technical tributary canyon\n(Larp Canyon), dropping in one of the other non-technical tributaries,\nstart pre-dawn and are prepared to hike out in the dark (it would be a\ngood idea to be prepared to bivy in case it comes to that). The\ntechnical section itself isn't super long but drops significantly in a\nshort distance. This canyon is among the best in Southern\nCalifornia.</p>\n<p>After a lot of rain be wary that the canyon could be flowing and may\nchange the rappels significantly. For example the 200' rappel in the\nlower section relies on having an anchor from a rock and small tree in a\nhanging bowl. One or both of these anchors may not be there after a lot\nof rain or may be hard to get to with water. If Ruby has water then Piru\nCreek is probably at high flow. The first descent was done on November\n22nd, 2014 after a few years of drought. This is not a beginner canyon,\nyou should be very familiar with natural anchors and be ready to rebuild\neverything.</p>\n<p><strong>Warning</strong>: This general area of Los Padres NF has\nhistorically had significant illegal grow-ops</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>This route requires a car shuttle. Spot your exit vehicle at Lake\nPiru. Take Piru Canyon Road until you reach a locked gate across the\nroad at 34.479969, -118.770558, park in the paved lot on the right\n(east) side of the road. All vehicles entering Lake Piru are required to\npay a fee of $10/day.</p>\n<p>To get to the trailhead take Hwy 126 east to Interstate 5 north, exit\non Templin Highway. Turn left and drive under the freeway and continue\nnorth approximately 3 miles to Oak Flat Campground/Oak Flat trailhead\nwhich is at 34.5990, -118.7226. Follow the trail from the parking area\nas it winds its way to the ridge where it intersects with the fire road\nat 34.5914, -118.7293. From here there are a number of drainages all\nleading to Lower Ruby Canyon. There is a use trail that more or less\nfollows the main branch of Ruby Canyon. To get to this take a left at\nthe fire road and continue on to around 34.5855, -118.7249 (\"alt ruby\ndrop in\" on the kml). Somewhere between there and 34.5848, -118.7240 you\nshould be able to spot the use trail (please update the exact\ncoordinates when you find it). If not just descend anywhere that looks\nthe easiest and will end up the main branch of Ruby as marked on the\nUSGS and USFS maps.</p>\n<p>(To drop-in via LARP canyon) Once you reach the fireroad at 34.5914,\n-118.7293, go right (NW) and follow the fire road as it curves around\nthe mountain. When the fire road begins to make a wide turn, you'll see\na prominent rock formation on your left, and a ridge trending west. That\nridge will take you to the drop-in of LARP Canyon. Stay mid-way up and\non the right side of the slope directly in front of you to gain access\nto the ridge, and follow the ridge to the West. There is somewhat of a\nuse trail that follows the ridge. Take this to the drop in point of Larp\nCanyon at 34.5940, -118.7483.</p>\n<p>There are other ways you can drop into Ruby but this is the route\ntaken on the first descent. From the Oak Flat trail as soon as you reach\nthe fire road at 34.5914, -118.7293 the Ruby Canyon drainage is directly\nin front of you. One can drop in through any of these drainages which\nmay or may not contain rappels.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p><strong>Drop-in via Ruby Canyon-Main</strong></p>\n<p>Once the trail reaches the fire road at 34.5914, -118.7293 turn left\n(S-SE) and continue about 1/2 mile to approx. 34.5857, -118.7247 and\nmake your way down into Ruby Canyon. Once you are in the canyon follow\nuse trails initially and then into the stream course. There are no\nrappels in this upper section of the canyon, and none until you reach\n\"Lower Ruby.\"</p>\n<p><strong>Drop In Via Larp Canyon</strong></p>\n<p>From the saddle on the ridge descend the slop into the watercourse.\nAfter ten minutes or so you will come to the first significant obstacle,\na narrow crack. We down-climbed high LDC. It's pretty loose so be\ncareful. The only stable looking busy to anchor from appears to be over\nthe small saddle LDC, and then about 8' down the scree slope on the left\nside (not the closer bush on the right side, which appeared\nunstable)</p>\n<p><strong>Rappel 1: 25</strong>' from a rock center canyon.</p>\n<p><strong>Rappel 2: 30</strong>' from a bush LDC. A few down-climbs put\nyou at rappel 3.</p>\n<p><strong>Rappel 3: 30</strong>' from a bush RDC. A short downclimb is\nrequired to get to the bush.</p>\n<p><strong>Rappel 4: 160</strong>' Anchored from a bush high RDC. There\nis also a bush RDC after a precarious down climb which other parties\nhave evidently anchored from, but the stability of that bush is\ndeteriorating and the down climb is dangerous. There are various other\noptions to anchor from. You can get off this rappel a little early (20'\nor so) and climb around RDC (poison oak) or a more difficult down-climb\nRDC with a partner capture.</p>\n<p>After this rappel follows intense bushwhacking through abundant\npoison oak, which is virtually unavoidable.</p>\n<p><strong>Rappel 5: 25</strong>' from a knot chock center canyon, or a\nbush RDC, which is a better option. Followed by a short down-climb.</p>\n<p><strong>Rappel 6: 25</strong>' from a bush RDC. It may be possible to\ndown climb this drop.</p>\n<p>Continue down canyon avoiding the poison oak. There are some\ndown-climbs and climb-arounds but no more mandatory rappels. Soon you\nwill reach the junction of Ruby canyon and the going gets easier. It is\nmostly a sandy wash with pretty light bushwhacking. There seems to be a\nfairly worn use trail to avoid the bushwhack. After just under a mile\nyou will arrive at the Ruby narrows followed by the lower technical\nsection. The canyon begins as an interesting crevice through the\nconglomerate which deepens suddenly.</p>\n<p><strong>Lower Ruby:</strong></p>\n<p>This is where the canyon gets good. The canyon starts off with a\nshort beautiful narrows section in the conglomerate rock, followed by a\nfew down-climbs. Some of these down-climbs are difficult and some\nparties may choose to rappel in a few areas or meat anchor with your\nbest climber going last.</p>\n<p><strong>Rappel 1: 70</strong>' from a pinch-point RDC between a very\nlarge and precariously balanced boulder and a smaller boulder.</p>\n<p><strong>Rappel 2: 100</strong>' from a pinch-point low LDC, dropping\nover a few stages.</p>\n<p><strong>Rappel 3: 30-40</strong>' off of a rock fin.</p>\n<p>Rappels 2 &amp; 3 may be combined with the appropriate rope, as the\npull is clean through those two drops.</p>\n<p>Warning: a pinch point in the flow a few meters downstream of the R2\nanchor has been known to trap ropes. Utilize extreme care when setting\nthe path for the rope and pull cord.</p>\n<p><strong>Rappel 4: 25</strong>' from a tree LDC. The tree is somewhat\nobscured by boulders. Awkward start. Get off rope on the flat sandy\nledge and down-climb LDC, down a convenient rock ramp. There is a pretty\ninteresting crack on the right that could be stemmed or rappelled if\ndesired.</p>\n<p>There are some down-climbs here and looking ahead the canyon drops\nsuddenly with a view into Piru Creek far below.</p>\n<p><strong>Rappel 5: 55-60</strong>' rappel down into the small bowl at\nthe top of the big rappel from a pinch point center canyon.</p>\n<p><strong>Rappel 6: 200</strong>' rappel from a rock fin and a tree,\nrigging an equalized anchor employing both objects. Amazing fluted\nrappel.</p>\n<p><strong>Rappel 7: 80' - 100</strong> from a tree DCL. The first\ndescent of this canyon involved a downclimb to the pothole below where a\nbush was the anchor for a 55' foot rap. This pothole was all blown out\nby the 2017 floods, so we created the longer anchor from higher up in\n2018. We used a fiddlestick to avoid rope pull issues with the debris at\nthe top of this rappel.</p>\n<p><strong>Rappel 8: 50</strong>' High from a good sized cottonwood tree\nabout 20' high RDC, which requires a short but hazardous climb that\nshould have an assist (2 person job) Note that whoever builds it can\nLAMR and rappel from that ledge. Alternately, combine Rappels 7 and 8\ninto one rappel, as the pull through those two drops is clean. You'll\nfind yourself in a beautiful narrows section with some shallow pools at\nthe bottom. To make things easier someone can man the rappel station\nwith a carabiner on a sling to pull in the rope after each person\nrappels.</p>\n<p><strong>Rappel 9: 30</strong>' from a little rock arch high RDC. We\nalso built a small back up of black webbing in another arch, just in\ncase the primary one blew out.</p>\n<p><strong>Rappel 10: 160</strong>' anchored off a rock choke ldc. Nice\nmulti-staged rappel through a bowl and pothole with some water in it\nthat can probably be avoided. There is a large sandy area followed by\nthe last vertical section of 80' or so. It's a little more interesting\nif you stay to the RDC side through the flute, which becomes\nfree-hanging for a short section after navigating the lip.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>At the bottom of the last rappel head downstream (RDC) until the\njunction with Piru Creek. There are some good sandy places here to camp\non the RDC side. Or you can head a little further downstream where Piru\nCanyon opens up a little more and there are other options for\ncamping.</p>\n<p>Piru Creek should be flowing year round. It is fed by Pyramid Lake\nand it's required by law that they release water for the trout habitat.\nTherefore this is a good place to rely on for water and to camp.</p>\n<p>To return to your exit vehicle we present two options. The first 3\nmiles or so will be bushwhacking down Piru Creek, staying mostly on the\ncanyon right side, with frequent stream crossings and faint game trails\nto follow. You will eventually run into a now closed access road (gravel\ninitially then turning to paved) on the canyon right side. This road\ncrosses the creek so it will be essentially impossible to miss. Continue\nalong this road, passing a private ranch on the west side of the road.\nDo not trespass onto their property. After the ranch there are two more\ncreek crossings, so be prepared to de-shoe to navigate them. This road\nwill eventually lead to your shuttle vehicle at Piru Lake, about 10\nmiles from where Ruby Canyon runs into Piru Creek. This is the route the\nfirst descent team used.</p>\n<p>Despite the many \"No Trepassing\" signs, the residents which use this\nroad are very friendly, and reportedly \"haul a lot of guys out\" from\nPiru Creek. It would be well worth attempting to hitch-hike to your car,\nas the paved road is very long, climbs some tedious hills, and will\nfurther fatigue your already beat-up feet.</p>\n<p>The second option is to walk along the service road noted above until\nyou reach a \"Gaging Station\", noted on maps, located at 34.5231,\n-118.7574, a little over half a mile passed the closed/abandoned USFS\nBlue Point Campground. Blue Point Campground is about 4 miles from the\nRuby Canyon/Piru Creek intersection. At this point, find a \"Road Closed\"\ngate and use it to re-enter the now wide/flat/mostly vegetation-free\nPiru Creek wash, staying on the canyon right side. Follow the wash for\napproximately 4 miles, staying on the west side of Piru Lake (RDC). Piru\nCreek remains relatively clear until about 34.506628° -118.758457°,\nwhere the bush thickens up considerably and becomes an arduous\nbushwhacking experience which may continue until you reach the lake\nshore. Traverse the shore until 34.479007, -118.759937. At this point\nleave the shoreline and hike west approx. 1/3 mile to your shuttle\nvehicle. This option is several miles shorter without the elevation\ngain/loss (of about 1800 feet) you will encounter on the paved road, and\nwill allow you to carry much less water as you will be in the vicinity\nof Piru Creek the entire hike, though these advantages may be nullified\nby the wearisome bushwhack in the lower reaches of the creek.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<p>There is a private ranch on the road used on the egress hike, take\ncare not to trespass on this land. If you are leaving a shuttle\nvehicle(s) at Piru Lake there is an entrance/daily fee for each vehicle,\nwhich charged $26 to leave the car two nights at the time of this\nwriting. You can leave a vehicle outside of the fee area, but it will\nadd several miles onto an already long exit hike.</p>\n<p>Be cautious of pot farmers in the grow season Mar-April to November.\nThere was some tubing (not currently in use) in Larp Canyon and lots of\nfootprints and a well defined use trail in Ruby canyon above the\ntechnical section. Hunters, hikers, \"farmers\"?</p>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<p>5/21-22/2016 - Decided to run this canyon as our first two-day\nexperience. It really felt like an expedition. Left Oak Flats at around\n9 am, and found ourselves at the drop in to LARP at around 11:30 am. Oak\nFlats trail is kinda brutal with backpacks full of carabiners, ropes,\nand bivy gear. The descent into LARP was ok. Lots of scree, and gaiters\nare advisable. We arrived at the first obstacle, \"the narrow crack,\" and\ndecided to take the down-climb option, although it was pretty sweaty,\nespecially with all the gear we were lugging. One of our packs took a\nfall and rolled all the way to the base, launching a 1.5 liter nalgene\ninto the bush. If anyone finds it, give it a good home. LARP is a\nscruffy California-style canyon with lots of bushwhacking and debris.\nThe 160' rappel, Rappel 4, is the \"crux.\" We could not locate the bush\n\"high RDC\", but found some blue webbing (which we continued to encounter\nthe entire descent of both canyons) slung around a desperate looking\nbush about 12' below where we stood. A spicy down climb put us at that\nbush, which has definitely seen better days. We decided to rappel\nwithout our backpacks, and then sent those down separately, to minimize\nstress on the creaking shrub. I'd advise building a cairn, or finding a\nbush in better health at the top of the rappel.</p>\n<p>After completing LARP, and arriving into the sandy wash that is Ruby\nCreek, we concluded that it was NOT worth it. The poison oak is brutal,\nand the drops, we didn't think, were worth the effort. What's more, it\nshaved off a lot of time which could've been spent enjoying Ruby in the\ndaylight. If anyone finds an alternative drop-in to Ruby Canyon, we'd\nadvise taking it.</p>\n<p><strong>5-29-16 Alternate approach added to the above beta with an\nupdated KML</strong></p>\n<p>It's impossible to make a wrong turn navigating to Ruby Canyon proper\nfrom the intersection of LARP and Ruby, as the wash leads directly to\nthe crevice. The use trail is surprisingly well-worn, which was mostly\nconvenient but also slightly disconcerting, as we'd noted an abundance\nof defunct black tubing in LARP, which must've been used in some type of\nmarijuana grow operation.</p>\n<p>We arrived at the fascinating start of Ruby at about 4:30. There's a\nneat, tunnel-like formation which a perched boulder creates over a\nflute. Sliding down that drops you into a very southwest-style slot\ncanyon, carved from \"bubble-gum\" conglomerate. The first real drop,\nwhich appears mandatory, you can navigate by climbing up RDC and along a\nfin, which you can down climb. Be careful though, as the conglomerate is\nvery slippery. It's worth climbing back up to the base of that drop to\ncheck out the cave which you'll find there. A few other creative down\nclimbs put you at the first mandatory rappel.</p>\n<p>We began the gorgeous technical section. On a few of these, we opted\nto rappel without our bags first, and then lower them separately, as\nthere are some tight squeezes and awkward starts. This, combined with a\ndouble-strand rap which didn't reach the bottom of the drop and required\nan ascent on Rappel 5 (I've lengthened the estimated height in the beta\nabove), took a lot of time, and we found ourselves at the top of the big\n200', Rappel 6, as night was settling in. After having lost a nalgene in\nLARP, and with water running low, we decided to push on, and continued\ndown with headlamps. Rapping down #6 in the glow of the headlamp was\nsurreal!</p>\n<p>Finally, we arrived at Piru Creek around 10:45 pm without incident,\npumped water, and racked out. We were awoken in the middle of the night\nby an eerie, fairly loud, low-pitched and repetitive humming which\nappeared to travel up and down the watercourse. We heard it again the\nnext morning, but could not locate the source. It must've been some type\nof bird or frog maybe? Or aliens?</p>\n<p>Navigating down Piru is a damned bushwhack. There are some game\ntrails in sections, but at times you're just better off walking through\nthe water course. My only useful advice is to \"cut corners\" by exiting\nthe wash when the river takes a bend and walking over the pediment on\nthe inside of the bend when you can. This saves time and relieves you of\nmiserable bushwhacking. Eventually in the lower reaches you may find a\ntrail which someone has developed by sawing down impertinent\nbranches.</p>\n<p>Once we hit the service road things eased up. Our original intention\nwas to drop back into the creek at the \"Gaging Station,\" but we missed\nit and planned to drop in later when the road descended back to the\nelevation of Piru Creek, near the apiary. From a vantage point on a\nhill, the creek seemed like a bushwhack still, but we trusted the beta\nand tried to gain access to the wash, hoping it would be free of\nvegetation. Unfortunately, it proved to be the thickest bush we'd\nencountered all trip, and we turned around to gain access to the road\nagain. We trudged along the pavement with aching feet until a friendly\ncowboy from Oklahoma offered to transport us to our car, which then\ntransported us to a well-deserved Corona and tacos in Castaic.</p>\n<p>TL;DR - LARP’s probably not worth it, especially if you are allergic\nto poison oak. Pack as light as possible. Be prepared to run part of\nRuby in the dark. The egress BLOWS no matter what, but try hailing a\nride on the service road. Ruby Canyon is AWESOME, but every other part\nof this is Type 2 (or 3) fun.</p>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n<p>First known descent was on November 22, 2014 by Alden Anderson, Dave\nRed, David Angel, Randy Worth, Scott Swaney, Ron Hudson, Scott Merrill,\nKirk Belles, Steve Sieren, and Carole Da-Cruz</p>\n<p>11/22/14: There was a guy standing in the road near the trailhead as\nwe pulled up trying to figure out where to park. He was looking at us\nand smiling so we stopped and rolled down the window, perhaps he knew\nwhere to park. \"You here for the LARPING?\" We all looked at him\nconfused, except for David Angel who chuckled. \"What's that?\" we asked.\n\"Live Action Role Playing\" he replied in a slightly embarrassed,\nI-know-it-sounds-silly, tone. We all broke out laughing.</p>\n",
