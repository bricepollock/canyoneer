  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>Sad Cow is a sweet little Wingate slot. Fun for intermediate\ncanyoneers or better. In the narrow section after the two rappels and\npool, there is an opportunity to high-stem up to 40ft at a secure width\nfor about 100 feet or so, and could go X if continuing all the way to\nthe large cavernous silo. This canyon has something for everyone.\nBeginners can be belayed down the downclimbs.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>Park at the Little Death Hollow trailhead. Hike for about an hour to:\n37 45 17 N 111 13 04 W Head up the slickrock. The climb up is a\ndifficult 4th class scramble with some exposure. Be very careful about\nthe route you choose, retreating down the slope would be difficult.\nBelay required for the inexperienced. Having a climber in your group is\na good idea.</p>\n<p>Make your way around the bare shelf of slickrock to the top of the\ncanyon: 37 45 31 N 111 13 28 W. Please do not take the shortcut across\nthe crypto.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>1st Rappel: 70 feet from a chokestone, or 100 feet from a tree. To\nprevent rope grooves webbing should be extended from the chokestone, or\na FiddleStick should be used. If using webbing, bring enoug to extend\nthe anchor down to the shelf where the rappel goes vertical. This will\nprevent grooves and simplify the rope pull. Don't get sloppy on that rap\nstation, that rappel is pristine and could be kept that way with a\nlittle effort and ingenuity.</p>\n<p>2nd Rappel: 20 feet. Downclimbable by the highly skilled. Easily\nghosted with a little thought. You will encounter couple of challenging\nchimneys and a long wet hallway, up to waist deep (possibly a swimmer at\ntimes). The hallway can be stemmed over by the strong and skilled.\nBigger fellas (200 lbs+) will have a tough time in one narrow\nchimney.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>Hike for 90 minutes back up Little Death Hollow to your car and\nexchange high-fives.</p>\n<p>Expect a car-to-car time of about 6 hours for a small efficient\ngroup.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<p>This canyon is on public land so no permit is required.</p>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><img src=\"rwl_en.png\" title=\"rwl_en.png\" alt=\"rwl_en.png\" /><a\nhref=\"http://ropewiki.com/User:Super_Amazing_Map?id=Sad_Cow_Disease_-_Escalante\">Super\nAmazing Map</a> : Sad Cow Disease</li>\n<li><img src=\"rwl_en.png\" title=\"rwl_en.png\" alt=\"rwl_en.png\" /><a\nhref=\"http://canyoncollective.com/betabase/sad-cow-disease.92\">CanyonCollective.com</a>\n: Sad Cow Disease</li>\n<li><img src=\"rwl_en.png\" title=\"rwl_en.png\" alt=\"rwl_en.png\" /><a\nhref=\"http://bluugnome.com/cyn_route/escalante/escalante_sad-cow-disease/escalante_sad-cow-disease.aspx\">BluuGnome.com</a>\n: Sad Cow Disease Canyon</li>\n<li><a\nhref=\"https://www.stavislost.com/hikes/trail/sad-cow-disease-canyon\">https://www.stavislost.com/hikes/trail/sad-cow-disease-canyon</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<p><a\nhref=\"http://amazingslots.blogspot.com/2013/04/sad-cow-disease.html\">April\n16th, 2013</a> : Sad Cow Disease</p>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n",
