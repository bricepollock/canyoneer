Please do not take the shortcut across the crypto.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>1st Rappel: 70 feet from a chokestone, or 100 feet from a tree.  To prevent rope grooves webbing should be extended from the chokestone, or a FiddleStick should be used.  If using webbing, bring enoug to extend the anchor down to the shelf where the rappel goes vertical.  This will prevent grooves and simplify the rope pull. Don't get sloppy on that rap station, that rappel is pristine and could be kept that way with a little effort and ingenuity.\n<\/p><p>2nd Rappel: 20 feet. Downclimbable by the highly skilled. Easily ghosted with a little thought. You will encounter couple of challenging chimneys and a long wet hallway, up to waist deep (possibly a swimmer at times). The hallway can be stemmed over by the strong and skilled. Bigger fellas (200 lbs ) will have a tough time in one narrow chimney.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Hike for 90 minutes back up Little Death Hollow to your car and exchange high-fives. \n<\/p><p>Expect a car-to-car time of about 6 hours for a small efficient group.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Red_tape\">Red tape<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>This canyon is on public land so no permit is required.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Beta_sites\">Beta sites<\/h2><\/div>\n<ul><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http:\/\/ropewiki.com\/User:Super_Amazing_Map?id=Sad_Cow_Disease_-_Escalante\">Super Amazing Map<\/a> &#160;: Sad Cow Disease<\/li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http:\/\/canyoncollective.com\/betabase\/sad-cow-disease.92\">CanyonCollective.com<\/a> &#160;: Sad Cow Disease<\/li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http:\/\/bluugnome.com\/cyn_route\/escalante\/escalante_sad-cow-disease\/escalante_sad-cow-disease.aspx\">BluuGnome.com<\/a> &#160;: Sad Cow Disease Canyon<\/li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https:\/\/www.roadtripryan.com\/go\/t\/utah\/escalante\/sad-cow-disease-canyon\">RoadTripRyan.com<\/a> &#160;: Sad Cow Disease Canyon<\/li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https:\/\/www.stavislost.com\/hikes\/trail\/sad-cow-disease-canyon\">StavIsLost.com<\/a> &#160;: Sad Cow Disease Canyon<\/li><\/ul>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media<\/h2><\/div>\n<p><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http:\/\/amazingslots.blogspot.com\/2013\/04\/sad-cow-disease.html\">April 16th, 2013<\/a>&#160;: Sad Cow Disease\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Background\">Background<\/h2><\/div>\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nParsed by mw‐api‐ext.codfw.main‐6779cc57fc‐ckm4f\nCached time: 20240914191848\nCache expiry: 2592000\nReduced expiry: false\nComplications: [show‐toc]\nCPU time usage: 0.006 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.007 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 21\/1000000\nPost‐expand include size: 0\/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 0\/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 2\/100\nExpensive parser function count: 0\/500\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0\/20\nUnstrip post‐expand size: 0\/5000000 bytes\nNumber of Wikibase entities loaded: 0\/400\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%    0.000      1 -total\n-->\n<\/div>","technicalRating":3,"rappelLongestMeters":30.48,"name":"Sad Cow Disease","quality":3.9,"longitude":-111.2245,"permit":"No","vehicle":"Passenger","riskRating":null}
