  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>Kennedy Creek is a fun canyon in the headwaters of the Stanislaus.\nWith only a few rappels, it is not particularly technical has plenty of\nescape points. However, largely due to it's abundance of potentially\nserious swiftwater features, there is lots of exciting jumping and down\nclimbing, some of which could be considered challenging.</p>\n<p>It makes for a good add on to Leavitt Falls, as both provide an\nexcellent source of late season flow in the Sierra.</p>\n<p>There is a gauge just downstream of where you park, but this is for\nboth Kennedy and Summit Creeks. Late in the season when you would be\ndoing Kennedy, much of the water on the gauge is likely coming out of\nSummit Creek, which is kept artificially high by Relief Reservoir.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>Turn into Kennedy Meadows off of 108 and drive to the end of the road\nparking before the 'no vehicles gate' and past the cabin. Parking\navailability here might be tight on weekends.</p>\n<p>Apparently if you have a campsite further in you can drive another\nmile or so in, but otherwise you must walk. Take the trail at the end of\nthe road. You will climb through a gorge past Summit Creek. When a sign\npoints right to Relief Reservoir, turn left to head to Kennedy Creek. Up\na hill and down to the creek, a bridge makes for a good spot to suit up\nand get in.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>The first substantial obstacle can be completed with an exposed\ndownclimb on the left, or could be rappelled. A fun jump follows and the\ncanyon soon enters a short gorge. The first drop is a wide waterfall\nthat slams into a wall on the right, and makes for another exciting\njump. From here you can scramble your way down the canyon through and\nbeside small whitewater drops.</p>\n<p>Soon after is a sharp drop of 30 feet or so into a sort of cave.\nRappelling on the right makes for a fun free-hanging drop next to the\nfalls.</p>\n<p>The next falls is a double drop through a cool slot. It would\nprobably be pretty awesome to rappel through here, but another really\nfun option is to climb above the slot on the left, then jump into the\nbig pool. You will have to jump out to clear a ledge, but the landing\narea is wide open.</p>\n<p>Down the canyon things will open up slightly, and a waterfall on the\nright splits into two slots. You can climb past it on the left down into\na narrow gorge. The whitewater in here could be a bit intense, and there\nis a sort of technical jump of 5 feet off a boulder. The canyon left\nwall slopes in at an angle, while the canyon right wall is just past\nvertical, so jump as close as possible to the right.</p>\n<p>Not long after you meet the final gorge that you may have spotted on\nyour way up. Rappel out of the boulder jumble down to a chockstone, and\nrappel again into a shallow pool. There is a pretty sweet cave under the\nchockstone you just rappeled off of.</p>\n<p>A short jump of 4 or 5 feet follows, and then a drop of 8 feet that\nis most certainly not a jump. Water pours on either side of a boulder,\nand a lower/partner assist sort of thing works well. This is the last\nsubstantial obstacle. You can scramble down, cross Summit Creek and head\nslightly upstream for a rocky slope that takes you back to the\ntrail.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>Back down the trail to your car.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n",
