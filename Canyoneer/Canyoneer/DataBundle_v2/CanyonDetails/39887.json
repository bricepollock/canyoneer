  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>A short, easy, non-technical hike to explore a minor canyon that is\ntributary to the Verde River near the small town of Rio Verde. While the\nnarrows are not very dramatic and there are no technical challenges\n(except one short optional up/down climb) Eagle Hollow is still a fairly\ninteresting day with abundant wildlife at the wild and scenic Verde\nRiver.</p>\n<p>How you get there depends a bit on what part of the valley you are\ncoming from, basically navigate to Rio Verde, from Rio Verde Dr go north\non Needle Rock Road a short distance then turn right onto Box Bar Rd\nwhich becomes dirt for the last 1/2 mile. Follow this road to its\nobvious end after a grand total of one mile and park at the\ntrailhead.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>From the east end of the parking area, head through the fence to hike\neast, then south east on the complex system of roads, washes and cattle\ntrails that will get you to the river after about one mile. While the\nriver is nice here, it is also frequented by both cattle and horses,\ngiving it a bit of a barn yard feel (e.g. smell). The best place to ford\nthe river seems to be slightly up river from an island that splits the\nriver in two, where the water is at its widest point. At this spot the\nwater was only a bit more than knee deep, though you still should use\ncare not to loose your footing as you could go for a bit of an unwanted\nride. I crossed at a point farther south and almost directly across from\nthe mouth of the canyon where the water was more than waist deep and\nmoving very swiftly. It was clear at this point that a loss of footing\nwould carry you off down river where it might take some time (and\nconsiderable effort) to recover to shore. No matter where you cross make\nyour way south to the gravel wash where the canyon meets the river and\nhead up the wash.</p>\n<p>All waterways vary in flow rates to some degree, carefully evaluate\nthe flow of the river before attempting to ford it. I suspect there are\ntimes when crossing the Verde River here will be totally\ninconsequential, and times when it will down right dangerous.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>The easiest way to explore the canyon is by hiking directly up it.\nThe narrows are generally fairly shallow but are interesting, water\nsculpted conglomerate rock and the canyon is mostly free of brush making\nfor easy hiking. A few shallow pools may be found in the narrows and\nthere is one vertical obstacle at a chock stone a ways up the canyon\nthat is a moderately difficult, but short climb. The canyon can be\nexplored for a little under 2 miles, be sure to turn back before\nreaching the boundary with the Fort McDowell Indian Reservation (shown\non the topo map).</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>Return the way you came - a GPS may be helpful to navigate the\ncomplex web of roads and washes in the area - I got a bit off track on\nthe return hike and was glad to have mine.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<p>The east side of the Verde River is closed to all traffic of any kind\nfrom December 1st through June 30th to protect the eagles nesting in the\narea. Also be careful not to cross onto the Fort McDowell Indian\nReservation just slightly to the south of Eagle Hollow - the boundary is\nclearly marked on the topographical maps.</p>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a\nhref=\"https://www.facebook.com/pat.winstanley.7/media_set?set=a.1230042533721108.1073742111.100001461198708&amp;type=3&amp;pnref=story\">https://www.facebook.com/pat.winstanley.7/media_set?set=a.1230042533721108.1073742111.100001461198708&amp;type=3&amp;pnref=story</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n",
