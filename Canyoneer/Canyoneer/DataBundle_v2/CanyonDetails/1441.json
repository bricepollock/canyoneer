  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>Beggar's Canyon is a very short and fun canyon right next to the West\nFork parking lot. An easy .6 mile hike up a ridge leads to an easy\ndrop-in with minimal bushwhacking.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>Hike up the obvious ridge going NW from the parking lot north of the\nWest Fork bridge. Take this up for about 1,000ft until you find a\nsuitable place to drop into the canyon.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>There are several short rappels leading to a longer rappel with a\npossible anchor challenge. We placed webbing around a handful of thin\nbranches coming out of the ground and backed it up with a meat\nanchor.</p>\n<p>The last rappel is about 150ft, and brings you down from the rim into\nWest Fork. A 200ft rope and 200ft pullcord are suggested for this,\nthough there are trees partway down one could rapp off if one lacks such\nequipment.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>Hike east along West Fork Road to your car.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a\nhref=\"http://sangabrielmnts.myfreeforum.org/ftopic4542-0-0-asc-.php\">First\nDescent TR</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n",
