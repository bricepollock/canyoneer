class=\"mw-content-ltr mw-parser-output\" lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><p>A rugged and remote canyon tributary to Secret Canyon with loads of hiking through dense brush and over countless boulders with some nice scenery and a beautiful, big rappel.\n<\/p><p>From Flagstaff, travel west on route 66, then south on FR 231 (Woody Mountain Rd). After 14 miles turn right onto FR 538 and follow it for 12 miles ignoring all branching roads that take you off 538 all the way to its end at Secret Mountain trailhead.\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>From the Secret Mountain trailhead, hike south on the trail for 1.6 miles until you reach the remains of Secret Cabin; enter and begin hiking down the drainage here.  Hike through the brush and over the dead trees for about a mile until slickrock appears underfoot and some minor narrows begin.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Continue down canyon through short sections of narrows and a few shallow pools to arrive at a moderate, somewhat awkward downclimb through a crack on the right of about 12 feet that some may wish for a rope to assist with - shortly afterward you will reach the big rappel sequence.  The anchor for the big rappel is two bolts and hangers on canyon right, but reaching this anchor will require a rappel of about 25 feet from a good tree on the left - we rigged a releasable anchor from this tree to reach the anchor.  The big rappel is right around 325 feet from this anchor to a pool that is a few feet deep; most of the length of the rappel is slightly less than vertical allowing the rappeler to keep their feet on the wall for most of the way down.  After this big drop is a short drop though a nicely sculpted chute of about 25 feet anchored from a pinch point in the watercourse.  More bushwacking brings you to rappel number four which is about 60 feet and sloping and can possibly be downclimbed.  After thrashing for a few more tenths of a mile downcanyon you will arrive at rappel number five which is about 100 feet through a beautiful chute - this last rappel can be bypassed via a faint trail above the drop on the slope on canyon left - as our group was running out of time, we opted to skip this last rappel and make our way from this point to Secret Canyon for the exit.  There is a small cairn above the drop that will help you find the trail, but expect to lose it in fairly short order afterwards.  The goal from here is to make your way east\/northeast to find a way into or alongside Secret Canyon.  Either way you get there, once reaching Secret Canyon turn left and begin the long, draining slog up this more major canyon to eventually find the exit.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>The only thing that stands between you and the trailhead at this point is 3.6 miles of brush thrashing and boulder hopping up Secret Canyon - on our visit the route was quite thick with poison ivy, New Mexico Locust and black berry briars.  Take care to stay in the main drainage of Secret Canyon heading north, passing the confluence with Voodoo and Sunburst Canyons and their exit route drainage; then west to head toward the exit drainage.  You may find one small cairn marking the drainage that leads up to the saddle and back to the trail after roughly 2.7 miles.  Head up this steep, brushy drainage to reach the saddle and the trail you hiked in on earlier in the day.  At roughly the half way point up the exit drainage there is a Y-split - right is more direct, but looked to be more brush-choked, left is a bit more clear, but quite steep and goes a bit out of the way to the south - choose the route you find to be the best of bad options.  Once up and out of the drainage locate Secret Mountain trail and turn right to follow the trail back to the trailhead and your vehicle.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Red_tape\">Red tape<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Beta_sites\">Beta sites<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media<\/h2><\/div>\n<ul><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external free\" href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/pat.winstanley.7\/media_set?set=a.1108321389226557.1073742083.100001461198708&amp;type=3&amp;pnref=story\">https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/pat.winstanley.7\/media_set?set=a.1108321389226557.1073742083.100001461198708&amp;type=3&amp;pnref=story<\/a><\/li><\/ul>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Background\">Background<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>FD: Lars Romig, Kevin Keith and Allen Schimberg 06\/30\/2013 Beautiful large rap in a modertly good but brushy canyon on a very sad day.\n<\/p>\n\n\n<\/div>","shuttleSeconds":null,"permit":"No","waterRating":"B","rappelCountMin":5,"timeRating":"IV"}
