It contains one good rappel, but\nisn't much good otherwise.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>From Black Rock Campground, drive back to the paved road and turn\nright to head uphill on the paved road. Keep right at the fork and\ncontinue on a smaller dirt road until reaching a larger road near the\nWishon Reservoir. Turn right and cross the dam. Continue on this road\nuntil there is a right fork, and take that fork to the right. Just\nbefore crossing Rancheria Creek, there is a small dirt road and parking\narea.
