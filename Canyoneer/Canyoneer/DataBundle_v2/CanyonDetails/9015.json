It consists of waterfalls into a narrow gorge and cavern beneath an arch through which the Gallinas river flows slowly. Blue and clear water pools for swimming are at the top and bottom of the cavern, you can swim down the tunnel and explore the caverns. Michelle Nilles told me \"Puente de Dios is the best swimming hole I have been in my whole life\" and I completely agree.\n<\/p><p>Also interesting to visit are the Cascada de Tamasopo 2 miles north of town, which features three cascades tumbling about 20 metres (66 ft) into pools divided by travertine ledges and shelves. The character of the waterfalls reminds Havasu Falls in the Grand Canyon. Nearby is El Trampolin which consists of small waterfalls falling into clear, deep pools in the midst of a tropical forest.\n<\/p><p>The entrance fee in 2022 was 70 pesos per person. In 2015 it was 20 pesos per person.\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Red_tape\">Red tape<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>In Feb 2022, we were dismayed to find that the commercialization of this beautiful swimming hole now requires lifejackets for everyone to enter the water. This is quite ridiculous to have as a requirement, and has never been required in the decades I've been coming here. I attempted to enter the water by jumping off one of the cliffs without a life jacket, and I was surrounded by two lifeguards\/guards who made me put one on. Two other people in our group weren't allowed to enter the water at all because the guards didn't have enough lifejackets for them. The guards were blowing their whistles all over the place to alert everyone to us not wearing lifejackets.\n<\/p><p>Also, right at 5pm the guards all blew their whistles and forced everyone to get out of the water and leave, even though this was a good 1.5hrs before sunset.\n<\/p><p>It is very sad to see how controlled everything is becoming throughout Mexico, to the point of needless caution. It should be up to the individual or not to wear a lifejacket or not.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Beta_sites\">Beta sites<\/h2><\/div>\n<p><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http:\/\/www.tripadvisor.com\/Attraction_Review-g3181068-d12793488-Reviews-Puente_de_Dios-Tamasopo_Central_Mexico_and_Gulf_Coast.html\">Trip Advisor reviews<\/a>\n<\/p><p><a class=\"external text\" href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Tamasopo\">Wikipedia page on Tamasopo<\/a>\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Background\">Background<\/h2><\/div>\n\n\n<\/div>","quality":4.2}
