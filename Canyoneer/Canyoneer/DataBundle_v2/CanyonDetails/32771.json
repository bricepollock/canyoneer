In wet conditions there may be a thigh-deep pool or sticky mud at the bottom.<\/li><\/ul>\n<ul><li><b>R3<\/b>: 20ft down the watercourse into a series of potholes that lead to R4. Alternatively (and preferably), bypass by climbing LDC and finding a tree (often slung with webbing) with 35ft rappel directly into R4. Depending on the anchor situation with R4, you may wish to preserve the option to use this tree for a multistage rappel; the pull will not be great, but it beats being stuck above a 70ft rappel with no anchoring options.<\/li><\/ul>\n<ul><li><b>R4<\/b>: 70ft into a beautiful chamber. Was previously anchored with a deadman in the watercourse. The current anchor is webbing extended 50ft or so from a log jammed into a crack in the watercourse up canyon. This should be considered a marginal anchor and be suitably backed up when rappelling. Make sure to extend the webbing reasonably close to the edge of the rappel to ensure a better pull and minimize rope grooves.<\/li><\/ul>\n<ul><li><b>R5<\/b>: 15ft into what will usually be a deep pool.<\/li><\/ul>\n<ul><li><b>R6<\/b>: 30ft from a cairn anchor into a sculpted section of narrows under an arch. This anchor can be used to facilitate a subsequent downclimb that some may wish to rappel, but the multi-stage pull can be challenging.<\/li><\/ul>\n<ul><li><b>R7<\/b>: 20ft off a chockstone into what will usually be a deep pool. After this rappel there is a downclimb into a pothole which can be bypassed RDC.<\/li><\/ul>\n<ul><li><b>R8<\/b>: 40ft anchored from a couple of large boulder pinches.<\/li><\/ul>\n<ul><li><b>R9<\/b>: 50ft down a gentle pitch, anchored from a large chockstone. Rigging this anchor can be awkward, and a meat belay is recommended for beginners.
