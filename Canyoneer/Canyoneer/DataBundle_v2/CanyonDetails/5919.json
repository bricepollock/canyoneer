The very short trail crosses a suspension bridge over the Skagit River and provides several good viewpoints into the water levels of Ladder Creek.   At one time, there used to be large lights that were used to illuminate the lower sections at night for visitors, however, the Goodell Creek Fire of 2015 that nearly destroyed Newhalem itself burned the area around Ladder Creek and disabled the high voltage lighting system.  Much of the debris still remains visible.\n<\/p><p><br \/>\nLadder Creek often rages much of the year with only a very narrow window (if it presents itself at all) in the fall before the rains in which it's droppable.  The closest USGS Gauge that may or may not correlate is nearby Newhalem Creek.  At the time of the first full descent the gauge readings were as follows for Newhalem Creek: Discharge ~ 18cfs, Height: just under 2.2ft.  The 2006 exploration of the Upper Narrows was considerably higher. \n<\/p><p><br \/>\n<b>CAUTION:<\/b> This canyon has the propensity to have dangerous hydraulics, mandatory exposure to high\/extreme flow. Proceed with caution, only with highly experienced groups, and only when flow conditions permit.  Ladder Creek can be a very dangerous place even under the right circumstances, but certainly under the wrong ones.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>The lower part of Ladder Creek is accessed through a very short, 5 minute, touristic trail that can be quite popular.  From there, the approach is through the burned out forest to a plateau where the creek obviously opens.  Signs of an old, abandoned graded trail are evident on the North side of the Creek.  The final 200 feet or so involve bushwacking through thick new growth.  Scramble in. \n<\/p><p><a href=\"\/w\/index.php?title=Template:Pics&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Template:Pics (page does not exist)\">Template:Pics<\/a>\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>The Upper Narrows were explored in 2006.

Low angle ramp with turbulent water leading to the final ~7' pushy rappel. Slippery ledges LDC were used tp traverse the first stage of the ramp.

Sarcastically dubbed \"No Worries Canyon\" because it was a little bit scary down in there.\n<\/p><p>In the upper narrows we encountered 2 smallish drops (bolts placed at the time &lt;2006&gt;) and several interesting downclimbs into freezing, swirling, crazy water. \nWhich brought us to one of the most magnificent corridors I have ever seen in a canyon. Long straight narrows, ultra smooth water polished rock dropping approx 20m over a 60m distance. Lots of water hazards to cross\/ swim scramble around and very, very intimidating. \nAfter establishing an anchor, Rob enquired if I (Joe) would like to go first.. I am pretty sure the fear on my face gave my answer. \nRob sorted his gear, got on rope, looks at me and says <i>\"IF I die, don't go this way.\"<\/i>.. like i'd have a choice... <i>\"no worries\"<\/i> i says.\n<\/p><p>After this corridor was an even scarier 20m water fall ending in a 90deg bend with a stupid amount of water blasting through a tiny gap.\n<\/p><p>The canyon then flattens right out for several 100m meters. The canyon walls disappear and you find yourself walking down a pleasant (but still cold) little mountain creek.. butterfly's, bird songs and flowers.. how sweet.\n<\/p><p>Then you reach the \"tourist section\".. amazing place. Hats off to those who tackle this beast.\n\"\n<\/p><p><br \/>\n<b>The first full descent took place on October 6, 2022 by Joe Cruikshank, Andrew Humphreys, and Erik Bernhoft.<\/b>\nAn unusually dry and prolonged summer of 2022 lead to universally low water levels across Washington.  Ladder Creek was at one of the lowest water discharges that had been noted in many years.  At this discharge, the water was pushy (likely A4) but the unavoidable hydraulics and terrifying obstacles described in the 2006 exploration of the upper narrows were not encountered. Anchors were placed in a manner that have a reasonable chance of survival despite the violent nature of this canyon at peak discharged.  On Oct 6, 2022 Nearby Newhalem Creek was discharging roughly 18cfs and the gauge height was just under 2.2ft.  Interestingly, over 16 years later, at least 1 anchor from the 2006 creek had survived entirely in tact.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Historical_water_flow\">Historical water flow<\/h2><\/div>\n\n\n<\/div>"}
