Please <a\nhref=\"mailto:coops@fawk.eu\">contact Coops</a> if you have any concerns\nregarding it. </small></p>\n</div>\n<p>Ladder Creek is an aesthetic slot canyon located behind the Gorge\nPowerhouse in Newhalem, WA. The very short trail crosses a suspension\nbridge over the Skagit River and provides several good viewpoints into\nthe water levels of Ladder Creek. At one time, there used to be large\nlights that were used to illuminate the lower sections at night for\nvisitors, however, the Goodell Creek Fire of 2015 that nearly destroyed\nNewhalem itself burned the area around Ladder Creek and disabled the\nhigh voltage lighting system. Much of the debris still remains\nvisible.</p>\n<p>Ladder Creek often rages much of the year with only a very narrow\nwindow (if it presents itself at all) in the fall before the rains in\nwhich it's droppable. The closest USGS Gauge that may or may not\ncorrelate is nearby Newhalem Creek. At the time of the first full\ndescent the gauge readings were as follows for Newhalem Creek: Discharge\n~ 18cfs, Height: just under 2.2ft. The 2006 exploration of the Upper\nNarrows was considerably higher.</p>\n<p><strong>CAUTION:</strong> This canyon has the propensity to have\ndangerous hydraulics, mandatory exposure to high/extreme flow. Proceed\nwith caution, only with highly experienced groups, and only when flow\nconditions permit. Ladder Creek can be a very dangerous place even under\nthe right circumstances, but certainly under the wrong ones.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>The lower part of Ladder Creek is accessed through a very short, 5\nminute, touristic trail that can be quite popular. From there, the\napproach is through the burned out forest to a plateau where the creek\nobviously opens. Signs of an old, abandoned graded trail are evident on\nthe North side of the Creek. The final 200 feet or so involve\nbushwacking through thick new growth. Scramble in.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>The Upper Narrows were explored in 2006. The first Full Descent was\n16 years later in 2022.</p>\n<p><strong>Descent</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><ul>\n<li>All rope lengths are highly estimated and back synthesized from\npictures**</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>R1:</strong> ~10' from an anchor RDC that survived from the\n2006 exploration. Standing dismount</p>\n<p><strong>R2:</strong> ~30' from a log jam. Exposure to significant\nflow at this rappel is nearly unavoidable and was quite pushy in 2022.\nThe dismount was standing and it was possible to walk around the back of\nthe falls into a semi-comfortable swim down canyon.</p>\n<p><strong>R3:</strong> ~40' from anchor LDC. Low angle ramp with\nturbulent water leading to the final ~7' pushy rappel. Slippery ledges\nLDC were used tp traverse the first stage of the ramp. Dismount in 2022\nwas standing neck deep in a turbulent washing machine and showed\nsubstantial propensity for hydraulics at higher flow rates.</p>\n<p><strong>R4:</strong> 110' from anchor RDC accessed by short traverse\nline. Starting highly vertical (wall rappel) and far removed from the\nwater, the canyon turns and canyoneers land on a ramp with water raging\ndown into a shallow pool. In 2022, exposure to substantial flow was\nencountered. No immediate consequences are found below this rappel. It\nis potentially possible to scramble up and over a rock fin at the\nbeginning of the ramp to avoid flow exposure in higher flows.</p>\n<p>Long, friendly, relatively open corridor.</p>\n<p>Remnants of an old diversion dam of some sorts. Big timbers in a V\npattern noted embedded in creek w/ steel fixtures.</p>\n<p><strong>R5:</strong> ~25' from a log with light exposure to flow into\na deep cauldron. Swimming dismount. Has been jumped - always check\ndepth. Potential for hydraulics at higher flow rates.</p>\n<p><strong>R6:</strong> ~ 35' from a log jam. The entire flow of the\ncanyon briefly pinches down to 18\" before pouring off in a deep\ncauldron. In 2022 a log on the RDC below the pouroff was used. Dismount\nwas standing.</p>\n<p><strong>R7:</strong> ~50' from a log jumble. 10' to a little ledge\nand then 40' to a large room. Standing dismount.</p>\n<p>VERY narrow slot, only 3-4ft wide with the full force of the water\nbearing down. This is one of the most scenic sections of the canyon. In\n2022 it was possible to jump into the narrow slot or to shimmy/stem 5\nhorizontal feet over a small hydraulic that was formed from a 3-4' drop\nand then swim the corridor to a 5' jump into a pothole. In 2023 a large\nlog now blocks the slot, causing a powerful siphon underneath -\n<strong>approach the constriction with immense caution</strong>.</p>\n<p>Jump: ~10' into a deep cauldron that leads into the \"tourist\nsection\". This cauldron appears to have the propensity to develop a\nserious hydraulic at higher flows. In 2022 it was possible to jump into\nthe pool beside the whitewater. Note: this lead almost directly to a\npouroff into the final rappels. Caution required to not be swept over\nR8. There is a semi-comfortable, semi protectable ramp that leads to the\nanchor for R8 on the LDC side. In 2022 partner assistance was used to\nsafely execute this move. At higher flow rates this could be\nspicier.</p>\n<p>Two old, disheveled bridges span the canyon above.</p>\n<p><strong>R8:</strong> ~40' from an anchor LDC. The first half of the\nrappel is dry while the second half ramps down with fairly little\nexposure to direct flow. Dry dismount on a little ledge, then entry into\na swiftwater cooridor that will require caution not to be swept off the\nnext drop which is around 50' horizontally down canyon. In 2022, the\nflows were relatively comfortable to swim this without being on\nrope.</p>\n<p><strong>R9:</strong> ~35' from an anchor RDC on a ledge. It is\npossible to almost entirely avoid the flow at this rappel if desired.\nStanding dismount.</p>\n<p><strong>R10:</strong> ~35' from an anchor LDC. This anchor may\nrequire a belay to reach in times of higher flow, however, in 2022 was\nsafely reachable independently. R10 is entirely out of flow into a deep\ncauldron with the largest, entirely avoidable hydraulic.</p>\n<p>Beautiful exit slot/ corridor swim.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>Creek walk for 2 minutes to the footbridge overhead. Exit the creek\nat the footbridge and return via the established trail.

Heavy water flow, unavoidable hydraulics, waterfalls up to\n20m (approx). Sarcastically dubbed \"No Worries Canyon\" because it was a\nlittle bit scary down in there.</p>\n<p>In the upper narrows we encountered 2 smallish drops (bolts placed at\nthe time &lt;2006&gt;) and several interesting downclimbs into freezing,\nswirling, crazy water. Which brought us to one of the most magnificent\ncorridors I have ever seen in a canyon. Long straight narrows, ultra\nsmooth water polished rock dropping approx 20m over a 60m distance. Lots\nof water hazards to cross/ swim scramble around and very, very\nintimidating. After establishing an anchor, Rob enquired if I (Joe)\nwould like to go first.. I am pretty sure the fear on my face gave my\nanswer. Rob sorted his gear, got on rope, looks at me and says <em>\"IF I\ndie, don't go this way.\"</em>.. like i'd have a choice... <em>\"no\nworries\"</em> i says.</p>\n<p>After this corridor was an even scarier 20m water fall ending in a\n90deg bend with a stupid amount of water blasting through a tiny\ngap.</p>\n<p>The canyon then flattens right out for several 100m meters. The\ncanyon walls disappear and you find yourself walking down a pleasant\n(but still cold) little mountain creek.. butterfly's, bird songs and\nflowers.. how sweet.</p>\n<p>Then you reach the \"tourist section\".. amazing place. Hats off to\nthose who tackle this beast. \"</p>\n<p><strong>The first full descent took place on October 6, 2022 by Joe\nCruikshank, Andrew Humphreys, and Erik Bernhoft.</strong> An unusually\ndry and prolonged summer of 2022 lead to universally low water levels\nacross Washington. Ladder Creek was at one of the lowest water\ndischarges that had been noted in many years. At this discharge, the\nwater was pushy (likely A4) but the unavoidable hydraulics and\nterrifying obstacles described in the 2006 exploration of the upper\nnarrows were not encountered. Anchors were placed in a manner that have\na reasonable chance of survival despite the violent nature of this\ncanyon at peak discharged. On Oct 6, 2022 Nearby Newhalem Creek was\ndischarging roughly 18cfs and the gauge height was just under 2.2ft.\nInterestingly, over 16 years later, at least 1 anchor from the 2006\ncreek had survived entirely in tact.</p>\n<h2 id=\"historical_water_flow\">Historical water flow</h2>\n",
