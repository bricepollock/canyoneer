It is run as an addition after descending Ruby. Otherwise it\nwould be a short 2 - 3 hour canyon. The approach through Ruby and the\nexit, however, offer a wonderful 2-day adventure.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<p>The first descent was made by Dave Red and Alden Anderson.</p>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n"
