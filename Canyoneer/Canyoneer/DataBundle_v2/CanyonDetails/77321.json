  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>Cascade Falls is a short and sweet series of waterfalls that can be\ndescended quite quickly. A great training canyon for beginner canyoners\nor a nice run for more experienced canyoners who only have a few hours\nto spare. Super-easy access, short walk-in/out. Some get-fully-wet\nabseils, potholes and pools, but easy to drip off / warm up on open\nslabs between abseils so can be done in cooler weather. Can easily walk\nout from most drops, so ideal for beginners who may be cold or don’t\nwant to abseil further. Very good for teaching/practicing canyon\nrigging.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>As at February 2024: The path up the RL (right side going up) is\nclosed. The cascades must be approached from the Calderwood trail to the\nnorthwest, as shown on the location map.</p>\n<p>If parking on the pass at the start of the Calderwood trail it is\nhighly recommended to park at the upper trail (purple star on above\nmap), not at the lower trail (blue star) to avoid aggravating the\nlocals. Also there is very little parking at the lower (blue star)\nlocation.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>A series of 7 drops with various anchors, most placed to get you wet\nAll abseils are optional and can be walked around Some of the drops land\nin deep-ish wet “potholes” and can be a little tricky to traverse</p>\n<ul>\n<li>R1 | 22m | Sling, river centre | Sling off boulder in stream (reach\nunder the boulder), stepped abseil with 3 potholes in a row</li>\n<li>R2 | 37m | Bolts, river centre</li>\n<li>R3 | ~15m | Bolts, river centre</li>\n<li>R4 | ~25m | Bolts, river right</li>\n<li>R5 | ~15m | Sling, river right | Sling off tree</li>\n<li>R6 | ~15m | Sling, river right | Sling off tree. Can be jumped\n(check depth)</li>\n<li>R7 | ~30m | Sling, river centre | Sling off boulder in stream (look\nunder boulder)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>From the base of Cascade Falls walk back along the Cascade Walking\nTrack to the Cascade Falls Parking spot</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a\nhref=\"https://canyoning.org.au/forum/viewtopic.php?f=18&amp;t=799\">https://canyoning.org.au/forum/viewtopic.php?f=18&amp;t=799</a></li>\n<li><a\nhref=\"https://www.nationalparks.nsw.gov.au/things-to-do/walking-tracks/cascades-walk\">https://www.nationalparks.nsw.gov.au/things-to-do/walking-tracks/cascades-walk</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n",
