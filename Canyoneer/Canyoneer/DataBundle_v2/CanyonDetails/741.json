  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>Bishop is known to be one of the 3 hardest XX canyons in the Colorado\nPlateau.</p>\n<p>XX canyons are \"on your own\" kind of affairs. Please make sure you\nhave adequate experience/comfort and ability of high stemming 60'+ for\nnumerous hours before contemplating descending this canyon. A ramp up\nwith R/X experience is strongly encouraged.</p>\n<p>If you have no X experience, you’re in the wrong place to test out\nyour abilities. You’ve been warned! ❌❌</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>From Bishop camp, hike up and over knolls on the left (east) side of\nthe canyon. After 45 minutes of quick-ish hiking, rig a 150’ rope in the\npothole above the end of section 3 for your ascent out. Place webbing\nand backup the line, rope protection over the knot/edge can prove\nhelpful.</p>\n<p>Hike back to canyon head or start of section 2 and drop in\ncanyon.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>Section 1 would be a good intro. If you’ve done X and want more,\ncontinue through section 2.</p>\n<p>If you struggle through section 2, swallow your pride and exit. It’s\nbetter you don’t get into the XX of section 3 unless you feel strong\nwith the movements, big exposure, and are physically equipped for the\nintensity that ensues.</p>\n<p><strong>Section 1:</strong> PG and R- stemming</p>\n<p><strong>Section 2:</strong> A good ground level entry to get into the\nX meat.</p>\n<p><strong>Section 3:</strong> Ramp exit (LDC) if you’re not up for the\nXX. Exit ramp is at the side drainage/pool coming in on canyon left. If\ncontinuing down section 3, don’t be fooled by the next 100-200 yards, as\nit initially gets more casual. But then the challenges begin. Wide\nsilos. Gapers. And a 60’ elevator downclimb to ground gets you into the\ndark section. Tight stemming with sideway movement. Headlamp is\nnecessary! Once you find the light, it’s back into more of the XX,\nhiiiigh above the ground (~80’) with some major silos around turns, down\nand ups or the option to cross dangerously high, topped off with\n“crossing silos in the dark.” Another 60’ elevator/downclimb takes you\nto some open downclimbs under and between boulders, then after a few\nhundred yards of shimmying and avoiding the minimal water/mud, you’ve\nmade it through. &gt; ascend your fixed line (150’) LDC or…</p>\n<p><strong>Section 4:</strong> continue downcanyon through low\nconsequence twisting stems, 2 bolts LDC quickly followed by another set\nLDC, rig 60’ rope to both sets, and drop down to final anchor, RDC\n(can’t miss it). Rig 150’ down to canyon bottom/riparian section.\nExplore and enjoy- return the way you came. Up the 150’. Up the 60’. And\nfinally up the 150’ between section 3 and 4 (rigged from the bolts on\nthe rim, LDC/pothole).</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>Ascend up your fixed 150’ line between section 3 &amp; 4, and return\nto trailhead.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><img src=\"rwl_en.png\" title=\"rwl_en.png\" alt=\"rwl_en.png\" /><a\nhref=\"http://ropewiki.com/User:Super_Amazing_Map?id=Bishop_Canyon_-_Escalante\">Super\nAmazing Map</a> : Bishop Canyon</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<p>11.13.21 - Party of 6 (Josh, Tom, Mark, Luke, Tracy, Ryan). Fixed\nexit line (45min), and dropped into section 2 to give us more daylight\nfor riparian section. 4:15 through section 2 &amp; 3, then continued\ndown section 4, and hiked for ~2 miles in riparian section toward Willow\nCreek. Ascended lines and got to rim by sunset. Headlamp hiked to camp.\n5⭐️</p>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n<p>First descent circa 2006 by Rick Green and Spidey. Second descent\n2016. Should not be attempted by mere mortals.</p>\n",
