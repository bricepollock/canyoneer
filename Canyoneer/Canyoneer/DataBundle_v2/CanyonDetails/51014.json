It also has the advantage of not needing any rope or vertical gear, provided that you are comfortable with some easy short (&lt;10 feet) down climbs, one using 3 logs (see video).  From the clearing 3.7 miles up the Harding Truck trail, proceed south west through the brush until you can see a prominent ridge with a deep gully west of it.  Proceed down the steep dirt and rocky ridge with minimal brush issues.  Near the ridge bottom are a few larger oak trees, and a path cut through the sticker bushes which makes reaching the creek bed easy.  From the creek bed, proceed downstream through numerous pretty pools and a few short down climbs for 0.9 miles to Santiago Canyon.  NOTE: almost all of this canyon's beauty can be accessed by hiking upstream from short descent entry point, reaching the bottom of rap #4 with easy climbing and modest bushwhacking.\n<\/p><p><a href=\"\/w\/index.php?title=Template:Pics&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Template:Pics (page does not exist)\">Template:Pics<\/a>\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Full_Descent\">Full Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>From the large clearing in the Harding Truck Trail at 4.7 miles, head down the rocky slope to the south.  Near the bottom it is far easier to stay out of the creek bed on the rocks for a few hundred feet as the brush in the creek bed is extremely dense. Eventually you are forced into the creek bed and bushwhacking begins.  Watch out for poison oak, as there are many clusters of it, some difficult to work around.  About 1\/3 mile downstream you reach the first rappel with anchor rigged LDC off 2 small bushes equalized.  Further downstream there are 2 more rappels rigged directly (ghosted) around sturdy bushes.  A bit further yet is the biggest rappel #4 rigged by tossing the rope directly (ghosted) over a horizontal tree above the drop itself.  The nice flat-topped big rock LDC has an awesome view overlooking the drop, but beware it has a giant poison ivy bush directly next to it.  After that is a series of easy down climbs and pools, and the brush gets much easier to navigate.  Within a 1\/3 mile the full descent reaches the short descent marked by 2 rock cairns in the creek bed.\n<\/p><p><a href=\"\/w\/index.php?title=Template:Pics&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Template:Pics (page does not exist)\">Template:Pics<\/a>\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Once Laurel Springs Canyon joins with Santiago Canyon, continue downstream 1.3 miles until you reach buildings.  Although it is easy enough to exit through the first private property driveway you will see DCR and climbing over a 3 foot stone wall on the left side of a large steel gate, it likely wiser to continue further down stream in the creek bed.  Once you reach a road bridge across the creek, climb up to that roadway, and it's a short walk back to the parking lot.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Red_tape\">Red tape<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>None: Cleveland National Forest Service property\nExcept as noted the exit crosses private property for a short distance.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Beta_sites\">Beta sites<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>The log climb:\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external free\" href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/vBZaW7TgZ_E\">https:\/\/youtu.be\/vBZaW7TgZ_E<\/a>\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Background\">Background<\/h2><\/div>\n\n\n<\/div>","id":51014,"url":"https:\/\/ropewiki.com\/Laurel_Springs_Canyon","technicalRating":3,"permit":"No"}
