About 40 feet after the slot starts; is an easy stem downclimb of about 10 feet where you walk under some rock and are in a deep narrow slot. Stem down canyon about 25 feet off the deck as the floor quickly drops out from under you. After about 60 feet of stemming you are still up off the deck a significant distance but your line of travel is only 5 or 10 feet above where the walls are too narrow for you to fit. Continue stemming down canyon about 175 feet gradually working your way upward to the top of the constriction that prevents you from staying low. The combination if multiple features on near vertical walls makes movement moderately difficult. Since the walls are too narrow for you to fall a significant distance; it is easy to lose awareness that you are over 40 feet up at times. When one of the many loose chunks of canyon walls fall off as you touch it; you are reminded of the actual depth of the sliver like crack below. (Data by bluugnome.com)",

Rap 2 only drops about 30 feet but 75 feet of rope may be used depending on sandtrap placement. It may be a good idea to stem up about 8 feet when pulling the rope to get a better angle and avoid rope grooves and make the pull smoother. Rap 2 may possibly be downclimbed but would be a little sketchy getting into and down the first 10 feet due to carnivorous rock and wide flaring walls. The later part of rap 2 would be an easy stem down in a narrow slot with parallel semi smooth walls. (Data by bluugnome.com)",

To start into this section carefully traverse over to the RDC side then crab walk / scramble down the steep slickrock into a trough like area. A meat anchor for all but the last man is a good idea here. Just after getting into the trough area is a drop of about 12 feet that works well as a combination partner assist / pack drag where taller people will be best used. This is a reachy partner assist but goes easier than it looks using the pack drag in combination. At the bottom of this drop is a pothole that could be a swimmer for a few feet if full but looks like it will usually be less than waist deep. Just after is one more drop of abut 10 feet where spreading wide works well and a partner assist may be useful. (Data by bluugnome.com)",
