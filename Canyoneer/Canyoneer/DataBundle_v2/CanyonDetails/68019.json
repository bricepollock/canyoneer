  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>Deep and wide canyon, but rather flat and full of boulders. It's a\nshort descent, probably good to do after another canyon in the\nregion.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>Take the Kapellenweg until P1750. From there go back down to the\nsmall bridge (P.1693), or continue to the village of Saas Fee for the\nupper part (no abseils there, except for entering the canyon)</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>There are 2 Bigger (20m) waterfalls that are worth it. Once you are\npast them, do not abseil in the oscuro of the gigantic boulders, there\nare 3 siphons in a row which are all completely blocked by branches,\ntrunks and human garbage. Take the via Ferrata to get through those\nboulders. At the very end, there are again Boulders, with a siphon where\nlight can be seen at the end, but is hasn't been tested out.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>Right after the last siphon is a mini rappel, small jump and some\ndownclimbs. Just follow the river and you'll get to the car very\nquickly.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n<p>Water capture just at the beginning of the upper part.</p>\n",
