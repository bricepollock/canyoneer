  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>A fun route when flowing strong, really pretty final rappel. It's a\nfairly short canyon which can be completed in 5-6 hours. It could be run\nyear-round due to its lower elevation, but april-october will be the\nbest times for warmer temperatures and stronger flow. This route can be\nclass C during big snow/heavy rain years. When it is class C it could\nmerit an \"R\" rating for the 4th and 5th rappels.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>From Kernville continue north on MH-99 as it parallels the Kern\nRiver. Continue past Gold Ledge Campground, and over Salmon Creek to a\nsmall gravel parking area on the east side of the road. There is a small\nsign indicating \"Salmon Creek Falls\" on the south end of this parking\narea. This parking lot is at 35.897590 -118.467080. Leave a vehicle\nhere. ***This is also the location where you can scout the flow for\nUpper Salmon Creek Falls. With binoculars, and walking around a bit to\nfind a break in the trees, you are able to see the upper falls.*** In\nyour shuttle vehicle turn around and drive south on MH-99 for a short\ndistance (less than a 1/2 mile?), back across Salomon Creek until you\nsee a gravel road on the east side of of MH-99. 35.893094 -118.464662.\nTurn onto this gravel road which roughly parallels MH-99 for a short\ndistance south, then forks hard back to the north (Left) then turns\neast. At the first 3 way fork stay on the middle fork going east. Back\nin this area it becomes a maze of unmarked gravel roads and can be\ntricky to follow. You will eventually make your way south and park at\nthe start of the Rincon Trail (33E23) which is a multi-use trail\nincluding off-road motorcycles (though rare in this section of the\ntrail). Park at the sign for Rincon at 35.893603 -118.456407. You'll see\nthe obvious beginning to the trail to the south. Walk this trail a short\ndistance to the south, it then veers north-northeast for 1/2 mile, then\nback north for about 3/4 mile to the bridge crossing at approximately\n35.902740 -118.448580.</p>\n<p>(NOTE: there is a gravel road within view of the parking area along\nMH-99 where you parked the first shuttle vehicle, about 300' to the\nsouth. This is not the correct road for the 2nd shuttle vehicle. There\nis primitive camping accessible from this road, however, which dead-ends\nafter a short distance due east {behind and above} of the parking\nlot.)</p>\n<p>Alternative shuttle we found to be better as this is where the trail\nends 35.898047, -118.460903 This is also the best place to gauge the\nflow.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>From the bridge enter Salmon Creek and proceed downstream on the\ncanyon left side. There was (2011) a fair amount of brush and poison oak\nin this area, we generally found that the most clear path was staying in\nthe middle of the watercourse. The first rappel (R1) is about 20' and\ncan be walked around on the canyon right side if desired. The second\nrappel (R2) is about 50' and can be anchored from a stout tree directly\nbehind the pour-over and puts you right in the middle of the fall.</p>\n<p>R2-high flow</p>\n<figure>\n<img src=\"R2LowerSalmon-hiflow.jpg\" title=\"R2LowerSalmon-hiflow.jpg\"\nwidth=\"300\" />\n<figcaption>R2LowerSalmon-hiflow.jpg</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>R2-low flow</p>\n<figure>\n<img src=\"R2LowerSalmon-loflow.jpg\" title=\"R2LowerSalmon-loflow.jpg\"\nwidth=\"300\" />\n<figcaption>R2LowerSalmon-loflow.jpg</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>The third rappel is about 30-40'</p>\n<p>After this rappel the canyon narrows dramatically, you'll want to\nstay canyon right. In heavy flow you will want to bail out of the\nwatercourse up to ridge on the canyon right side, traverse it, and\nanchor off of any of the numerous massive boulders up there to avoid the\nnext rap. If you want to scout the last 2 rappels you would continue up\nto a bench on the canyon left side, which allows a view down into the\ncanyon. If necessary you could rap off of one of several trees to avoid\nthe last two waterfalls all together.</p>\n<p>The fourth rappel (R4)(Rabbit Hole)is 10-15' into a short swim. This\nrappel requires careful consideration as you must enter a very narrow\ngap behind a large chock-stone.This rap should be monitored as rope\nentrapment usually occurs within the lower section.You can check by\ntugging the rope prior to rappelling.Also be mindful of foot entrapment\nas well. In heavy flow this would be deadly to enter. If the hole is\nblocked by flow, you can rappel over the top. You will have to install a\nlong single anchor as to not stick your rope on the pull.</p>\n<p>R4-low flow</p>\n<figure>\n<img src=\"R4LowerSalmon.jpg\" title=\"R4LowerSalmon.jpg\" width=\"300\" />\n<figcaption>R4LowerSalmon.jpg</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>R4-moderate-high</p>\n<figure>\n<img src=\"freddyr4salmon.jpg\" title=\"freddyr4salmon.jpg\" width=\"300\" />\n<figcaption>freddyr4salmon.jpg</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>The fifth (R5)and final rappel is an approx. 90' off of a massive\nchock-stone in the middle of the watercourse. In 2011 there were two\nbolts on the west edge of this rock. If these bolts are not there your\nanchoring options are limited. This rappel can be tricky in very heavy\nflow. All of the water coming off the fall is funneled into a narrow\nhallway that you must swim through to exit. This hallway is about 6-8'\nwide and 15-20' long. Water is coming from 2 directions so the\nhydraulics in there can be difficult to ascertain and even more\ndifficult to swim through. After the hallway there will be an additional\nswim of approx. 20-30' depending on sediment level. In the event that\nrap 5 is flowing too high - one person can rap down the big wall LDCL\noff a tree, and I believe two bolts have also been placed - to set up a\nguided rappel.</p>\n<p>Escape route: From the top section where you would enter the Rabbit\nhole. There is a good used trail LDCL high up is a shelf you can climb\nup very easily. Be sure take the highest route. Follow this down back to\nthe main egress trail.</p>\n<p>R5-high flow</p>\n<figure>\n<img src=\"R5LowerSalmon-hiflow.jpg\" title=\"R5LowerSalmon-hiflow.jpg\"\nwidth=\"300\" />\n<figcaption>R5LowerSalmon-hiflow.jpg</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>R5-low flow</p>\n<figure>\n<img src=\"R5LowerSalmon-loflow.jpg\" title=\"R5LowerSalmon-loflow.jpg\"\nwidth=\"300\" />\n<figcaption>R5LowerSalmon-loflow.jpg</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>After the last fall you will continue downstream, past an old sport\nclimbing area, on the canyon left side. At about 35.900476 -118.457044\nyou will see an obvious use trail on canyon left. Follow it until you\nget to the ridge where you can bushwhack a short distance to a gravel\nroad above you to the south. This gravel road is a fork of the road that\nyou drove your 2nd shuttle vehicle on. Follow this road downhill and\nback to the highway side lot that you parked your 1st shuttle vehicle\nat. If you continue on the use trail, instead of accessing the gravel\nroad, it will continue on to the small dam. Past the dam, through\noften-times thick brush and poison oak, you will need to cross salmon\ncreek and find a use-trail back down (west)to the road and your shuttle\nvehicle.</p>\n<p>Better shuttle drop off here 35.898064, -118.460855 Small dam (Also\nthe best place to gauge flow) This will save you about 20 minutes,\nespecially helpful when daytime temps are hot. The road you take off the\nHighway is here:35.893139, -118.464690 as you drive up you'll see an\narea used to turn your vehicle around 360 degrees so you can continue up\nthe to trailhead call Rincon Trail here: 35.893274, -118.457212</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<p><a\nhref=\"https://canyonaccident.org/lower-salmon-2022-04-23/\">https://canyonaccident.org/lower-salmon-2022-04-23/</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<p>8/13/2022 Low flow conditions, air temperature around 100F. Trip time\nincluding hike in, out, and lunch break ~6 hrs. Swarms of\ngnats/mosquitos near the top of Salmon Creek bridge, but less bothersome\nat R2 and beyond. Bushwacking above R2 required, with poison oak along\nwatercourse. New webbing added around a rock anchor on R2, but left\nexisting webbing around downed tree trunk in place (less preferable pull\nand downed trees rotting throughout canyon). Some pools between R2 and\nR4 are swimmers, but water was refreshing. Lots of submerged branches,\nso watch for foot entrapment in the pools. Bolts on R5 are secure but\nanchor nuts needed to be tightened. Webbing is in good condition.</p>\n<p>7/14/2019 (Ignore the thumbnail, the first half is Lower Salmon)\n{{#ev:youtube|VwMX02SPgL0}}</p>\n<p>6/11/16 Current flow is moderate - We added three new anchors – R1.\nDCR off a stout tree into the watercourse (to be used under moderate\nconditions only). R2. DCL Optional off a small tree 40ft into the water\nabout chest high – added purely for fun, you need to upclimb a ledge 20\nft. R4. DCL high off a tree – this is in case the rabbit hole is in high\nflow and is too dangerous 180 ft from the anchor.</p>\n<p>5/13/17 Our trip was aborted due to extreme flows at the bridge - we\nobserved class 2/3 rapids in the canyon.</p>\n<p>7/15/17 Moderate high conditions, weather was hot around 107. Perfect\nconditions, cool water suitable for a 3/2 or spring suit. Replaced\nanchor on Rap 2 due to excessive wear. Replaced anchor on Rap 3 (Rabbit\nHole) due to excessive wear. Footage of rabbit hole below.\n{{#ev:vimeo|228165686}}</p>\n<p>6/13/19. Very high conditions. Rabbit hole submerged and last rap are\nflowing very high.
