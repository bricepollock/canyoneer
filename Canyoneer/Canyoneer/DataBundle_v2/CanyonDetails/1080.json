The main attraction is the Wallace River within the park. It drops from an elevation of 1,600 feet to 800 feet in less than one-half mile. Over this distance, there are technically nine falls in excess of 50 feet. The largest falls in the park, the Middle Falls, drops 265 feet.\nThe falls, river, and lake were all named after Sarah Wallace, a strong spirited women of the Skykomish Indian Tribe who homesteaded the land between the towns of Gold Bar and Startup.\nWhile there had been multiple paths and scrambles to the Falls before, the Washington State Youth Development and Conservation Corps constructed the present trail leading to the base off the main falls in the mid 1970's. The initial development of the park was completed in the spring of 1976 and the park was open to the general public in 1977. The trail is about three miles long with scenic vistas and a picnic shelter.\n<\/p><p>The late Senator Frank Woody took a personal interest in the youth program of State Parks. He was instrumental in sponsoring legislation that provided funds for the Youth Development and Conservation Corps program. Because of Senator Woody's contribution, the Wallace Falls trail was named after him.\nMuch of the Wallace Falls Area was first logged at the turn of the last century from about 1900-1929 by the Wallace Lake Timber Company. In the early 1880's both the steam \"donkey\" and small steam locomotives were invented. The donkey was a steam-driven engine with a wire rope winch mounted on a log sled, which could be dragged through the woods from site to site. When anchored to a stump, the steam donkey could be used to pull logs out of the woods to a loading site. To haul equipment and logs, many railroad grades were built throughout the area to accommodate small steam locomotives. In fact the \"Old Railroad Grade\" trail is one of these grades built so long ago. You can still see occasional\nremnants of wooden trestles and other old grades throughout the park. To get goods to market and people to the area, the Great Northern Railroad built a local station in 1901. The Skykomish Valley had several logging outfits. The largest one was the Sultan Logging and Railroad Company, owned by George G. Startup for which the Town of Startup is named.\nJames J. Hill was a railroad tycoon who financed the transcontinental railroad. After Hill's railroad reached Seattle in 1893, he gained control of 44 million acres of land, much if it, prime timber areas. Hill later sold much of this land to Fredrick Weyerhaeuser. Weyerhaeuser purchased 900,000 acres, including what would later become Wallace Falls State Park from Hill for six dollars an acre.\n<\/p><p>For more information on the history of this area, please visit the Gold Bar Museum on Highway 2.\n<\/p>\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nParsed by mw‐api‐ext.codfw.main‐6779cc57fc‐xt8bs\nCached time: 20240914192016\nCache expiry: 2592000\nReduced expiry: false\nComplications: []\nCPU time usage: 0.003 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.004 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 3\/1000000\nPost‐expand include size: 0\/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 0\/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 2\/100\nExpensive parser function count: 0\/500\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0\/20\nUnstrip post‐expand size: 0\/5000000 bytes\nNumber of Wikibase entities loaded: 0\/400\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%    0.000      1 -total\n-->\n<\/div>","name":"Wallace River Canyon","url":"https:\/\/ropewiki.com\/Wallace_River_Canyon","id":1080,"riskRating":null,"months":["Jul","Aug","Sep","Oct"]}
