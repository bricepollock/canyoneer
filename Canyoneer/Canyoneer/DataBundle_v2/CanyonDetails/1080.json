  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>A beautiful, action-packed canyon, with big raps, big jumps, easy\naccess and multiple exits.</p>\n<p><strong>However please be very aware of the high profile nature of\nthe area.</strong></p>\n<p>On a sunny summer weekend, many hundreds of tourists will visit the\nfalls. For large sections anyone canyoning will be highly visible.</p>\n<p>The park has been the location of many injuries and fatalities to\ntourists over the years. Simply by being seen in the canyon tourists\nwill believe there is better access to the multiple waterfalls than\nthere is. There is no official access to any of the major waterfalls;\nonly by unsanctioned trails. Our access to descend Wallace Falls as\ncanyoneers is highly dependent on not being deemed a contributing factor\nto this problem.</p>\n<p>In order to keep the impact of our visibility down, please follow\nthese best practices:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><u>Avoid running the canyon at peak times</u>. e.g. weekends,\nholidays, etc.</li>\n<li><u>Keep your team small and efficient</u>. The main falls consists\nof a highly visible sequence of back-to-back rappels. Fast and efficient\nmovement through these sequences is important.</li>\n<li><u>Anchors need to be placed with consideration to their visibility\nfrom the trail</u>. Anything placed insight of the trail should be kept\nto neutral/natural colors (e.g. black, grey, brown webbing).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A good water level checkpoint is the Middle Falls as seen from the\nviewpoint along the trail.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>Hike up the trail to Upper Wallace Falls. Once you've reached the\nupper viewpoint, follow blue blaze markers nailed to the trees for a\nshort distance to a gravel road. Go right on the gravel road for 500\nfeet to the bridge and the drop in. Involves a 1600 foot gain and takes\nabout 1.5 hours.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>As of 2022, wet line bolts have been added to a number of raps to\nexpand the options across more flow levels.</p>\n<p>From underneath the bridge it's a short walk to the edge of the first\nrap.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>R1:</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>\"Drier\" option - DCR: 120' (or 100' to ledge + downclimb). Pair of\nbolts.</li>\n<li>\"Wetter\" option - DCL: 100'. Single bolt on slab face near far left\nside of canyon (downclimbing the stream). Good option if the other bolts\nare dry.</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul>\n<p><u>Rappel 2 &amp; 3 make up Upper Wallace Falls.</u></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>R2:</strong> 45'. DCR - 2 bolts, 10' up on a wall. Wet\nrappel, jump possible from lower ledges into pool.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>R3:</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Dry option - DCR: 100' 2 bolts, 8' up on wall.</li>\n<li>Wet option - DCL: 100' single bolt above lip of pool. This lets you\nrap on the wetter DCL side of the falls, but with some careful pendulum\nmanagement you may be able to rap the center line for the full\nflow.</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>R4:</strong> 50'. DCL - 2 bolts and chain, up a rock ramp.\nDry rappel into deep pool. The bolts and chain are painted the same\ncolor as the rock.</li>\n<li><strong>R5:</strong> 55'. DCL - dry rappel from tree far left.</li>\n<li>DC 15’ DCR in the flow and behind the veil.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Open creek walk for 15 minutes.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Jump 8’ or 15' from obvious stances up on DCL.</li>\n<li>8’ DCR quick rap from threaded pothole makes short and safer\nalternative to down-climbing or sketchy jump.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> At this point you're about to appear in clear\nview of people at the view point. It's worth staging any gear, snacking,\nor rearranging packs slightly upstream of here so you're of sight.\nThere's an exit point here, up the unsanctioned trail to the view\npoint.</p>\n<p><u>R6-R8 makes up Middle Wallace Falls.</u></p>\n<p><em>Dry option</em> - all DCL. Note this route makes you more visible\nto people at view point.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>R6:</strong> 70'. From the top of the falls walk down slabs\nDCL until it begins to get steep. Look for a 2 bolt anchor set out of\nsight of the viewing area. It's a dry bushwhack rappel to ledge\nbelow.</li>\n<li><strong>R7:</strong> 100'. Bolts DCL of the natural line of R6. Dry\nrappel, with free-hang. <strong>Beware of the very sharp edge.</strong>\nIt has nearly cut ropes on multiple occasions. Use rope guards, minimize\ndownward pull when descending, and inspect your rope between each\nrappel. Using your most static rope and rappelling in one continuous\nsmooth motion will minimize the sawing action.</li>\n<li><strong>R8:</strong> 120'. Bolts with extended webbing DCL. Walk\ndirectly away from the R7 face and they're in front and below you a\nlittle. Rope can be pulled from small cave 6’ above pool, then\njumped.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Wet option</em> - all DCR. Note this route keeps you more out of\nsight of people at the view point.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Traverse to R6</strong>. 20', single bolt on DCR (just\nbefore unsactioned path down from view point), provides handline down to\na pair of bolts on an overhanging face directly below the view point\n(R6). (not needed but very nice to have)</li>\n<li><strong>R6:</strong> 70', from the pair of bolts beneath the\nviewpoint, down to a rocky outcrop DCR. Space for 2 people at these R7\nbolts.</li>\n<li><strong>R7:</strong> 170', continue down the slope, over the lip,\nfreehang via a midway ledge, then down through boulders to top of the\nlower DCR slopes. The further right you choose to cross the lip, the\ndrier the experience.</li>\n<li><strong>R8:</strong> 80', single bolt on DCR wall in small undercut\nrock alcove, located at the top of the stream which flows down to the\npool.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Float in the pool admiring the height of the falls above you. Despite\nfeeling like you're all the way down, this pool is still inaccessible to\nmost people. To exit, continue downstream trending DCL.</p>\n<p><u>R9 makes up Lower Wallace Falls.</u></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>R9:</strong> 70’. Bolts on ledge DCL, not easy to spot until\non top of them. Potential to extend rap all way down into pool if flow\ntoo much to downclimb.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There is a potential exit right after you get out of the pool. The\nobvious, but steep and unsanctioned path will lead you to the reference\nphoto viewpoint on the main trail.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>DCC: 10’. Optional jump from central boulder into narrow landing\nzone pool.</li>\n<li><strong>R10:</strong> 40’. Bolts DCR, dry to ledge below. This is a\npotential large jump. (In Oct 2022, at very low flow, a good landing\nzone was identified, measured as 16' deep, as shown <a\nhref=\"http://ropewiki.com/File:2022-10-01_21_43_45-Window.png\">in this\nphoto</a>).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Creek walk 20 minutes and you will reach the picnic shelter. This is\nan easy DCR exit.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>15' jump immediately before picnic shelter exit, DCC.</li>\n<li><strong>R11:</strong> 40’ rap from obvious threaded pothole arch\nDCL. Alternately an impressive 40' jump from the ledge up on DCL into\ndeep pool. As of 2022 this landing was very deep (even in very low\nflows), and gaining enough horizontal distance was easy. Also possible\nto jump from lower ledges, but you may want the assistance of a rope\nfrom the tree branch above to access them safely.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Another bush-whack exit to the picnic shelter is possible at the R12\nbolts. This is the last exit to the trail until after R14 (which isn't\nas effortless).</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>R12:</strong> 60' DCL wet-line bolts on face, or DCR\ndry-line bolts on slab.</li>\n<li><strong>R13:</strong> 60' wet-line down center of falls from single\nbolt high on DCR. Dry-line DCL from bolts on top of large boulder set a\nway back from the edge.</li>\n<li><strong>R14:</strong> 60’ DCL webbing on blown down tree. Provides\ndry-line avoiding potentially slippery down-climb on slabby rock\nalongside watercourse.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>Since the hiking trail parallels the creek, there are several exits\nthat can be taken to shorten the length of the descent. These are\ndescribed in the Descent section.</p>\n<p>After R14 continue creek-walking downstream 600ft. A smaller river\njoins on the right (47.87309, -121.65862). Creek-walk up it 400ft, as it\nrounds the corner the footbridge you crossed on the hike in will appear.\nFrom the bridge it's about 30 minutes back to the parking lot.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>A Washington Discover Pass is required for the parking lot (not the\nNorthwest Forest Pass). An electronic kiosk is available to purchase a\nday or annual pass.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>The area is highly managed, but yet still the site of many critical\ninjuries &amp; fatal accidents. It is recommended to use discretion and\ncaution to avoid luring unprepared tourists near the top of the\nwaterfalls. Similarly avoiding the attention of zealous park officials\nis worthwhile. Please consider deflecting casual questions about your\nactivities if you are queried.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Apparently, the trailhead used to feature signs warning that wading\nor swimming above the waterfalls was prohibited and punishable by a $70\nfine. However, as of Sep 2014, this practice seems to have been\ndiscontinued, and no such sign has been in place for several years.\nNotices at the trailhead prohibit mountain biking, hunting, fishing, and\nwalking dogs off-leash but do not mention or prohibit swimming, wading,\nor off-trail hiking.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><img src=\"rwl_en.png\" title=\"rwl_en.png\" alt=\"rwl_en.png\" /><a\nhref=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20210527212206/www.canyoneeringnorthwest.com/WallaceRiver/Wallace_River.php\">CanyoneeringNorthwest.com\n(archive.org)</a> : Wallace River</li>\n<li><img src=\"rwl_en.png\" title=\"rwl_en.png\" alt=\"rwl_en.png\" /><a\nhref=\"http://ropewiki.com/User:Super_Amazing_Map?id=Wallace_River_Canyon_-_Washington\">Super\nAmazing Map</a> : Wallace River Canyon</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a\nhref=\"https://www.facebook.com/jeffbartlett/posts/10212817248444496\">https://www.facebook.com/jeffbartlett/posts/10212817248444496</a>\n(VERY low flow)</li>\n<li><a\nhref=\"https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.10153501707866103.1073742062.669366102&amp;type=1&amp;l=8831879173\">https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.10153501707866103.1073742062.669366102&amp;type=1&amp;l=8831879173</a>\n(low flow)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n<p>(The following is copied from the information board at the trail\nhead)</p>\n<p>Much of Wallace Falls State Park was acquired in 1971 from the\nWeyerhaeuser Timber Company. The main attraction is the Wallace River\nwithin the park. It drops from an elevation of 1,600 feet to 800 feet in\nless than one-half mile. Over this distance, there are technically nine\nfalls in excess of 50 feet. The largest falls in the park, the Middle\nFalls, drops 265 feet. The falls, river, and lake were all named after\nSarah Wallace, a strong spirited women of the Skykomish Indian Tribe who\nhomesteaded the land between the towns of Gold Bar and Startup. While\nthere had been multiple paths and scrambles to the Falls before, the\nWashington State Youth Development and Conservation Corps constructed\nthe present trail leading to the base off the main falls in the mid\n1970's. The initial development of the park was completed in the spring\nof 1976 and the park was open to the general public in 1977. The trail\nis about three miles long with scenic vistas and a picnic shelter.</p>\n<p>The late Senator Frank Woody took a personal interest in the youth\nprogram of State Parks. He was instrumental in sponsoring legislation\nthat provided funds for the Youth Development and Conservation Corps\nprogram. Because of Senator Woody's contribution, the Wallace Falls\ntrail was named after him. Much of the Wallace Falls Area was first\nlogged at the turn of the last century from about 1900-1929 by the\nWallace Lake Timber Company. In the early 1880's both the steam \"donkey\"\nand small steam locomotives were invented. The donkey was a steam-driven\nengine with a wire rope winch mounted on a log sled, which could be\ndragged through the woods from site to site. When anchored to a stump,\nthe steam donkey could be used to pull logs out of the woods to a\nloading site. To haul equipment and logs, many railroad grades were\nbuilt throughout the area to accommodate small steam locomotives. In\nfact the \"Old Railroad Grade\" trail is one of these grades built so long\nago. You can still see occasional remnants of wooden trestles and other\nold grades throughout the park. To get goods to market and people to the\narea, the Great Northern Railroad built a local station in 1901. The\nSkykomish Valley had several logging outfits. The largest one was the\nSultan Logging and Railroad Company, owned by George G. Startup for\nwhich the Town of Startup is named. James J. Hill was a railroad tycoon\nwho financed the transcontinental railroad. After Hill's railroad\nreached Seattle in 1893, he gained control of 44 million acres of land,\nmuch if it, prime timber areas. Hill later sold much of this land to\nFredrick Weyerhaeuser. Weyerhaeuser purchased 900,000 acres, including\nwhat would later become Wallace Falls State Park from Hill for six\ndollars an acre.</p>\n<p>For more information on the history of this area, please visit the\nGold Bar Museum on Highway 2.</p>\n",
