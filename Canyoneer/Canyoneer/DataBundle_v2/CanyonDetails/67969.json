A unoficial path then leads to the other side of the river. At\n1400m above sea level, go back to the water stream, there is a hunting\npath that goes there.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>At first there is a high slab rappel, then some walking, and after\ncrossing the path that got you up, there is a succession of smaller,\nmore polished waterfalls. But at no point you'll feel in a real\ncanyon.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>The canyon ends close to the parked car, it is easy to get back</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n",
