  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>This canyon is to be avoided, as it has more Poison Oak than the\nauthor has seen anywhere else in his entire life. There are a half-dozen\nrappels and no anchor challenges. The final three rappels are rather\nfun, but it's not worth it.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>From the parking lot on the north side of the West Fork bridge, hike\nup the obvious ridge leading NW from the lot. Take that up for half a\nmile and a little under a thousand feet of gain and drop into the canyon\non the right, if you must.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>Bushwhacking through endless Poison Oak. A couple alright sections,\nbut mostly bad bushwhacking and crummy rappels.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>Hike back south to the parking lot.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a\nhref=\"http://sangabrielmnts.myfreeforum.org/ftopic4542-0-0-asc-.php\">First\nDescent TR</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n"
