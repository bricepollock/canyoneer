  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>Should only be attempted by canyoneers with significant swiftwater\ncanyoning training and experience.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>From Ouray Hot Springs Park, drive south on Highway 550 for 21.5\nmiles where you will see a sign for South Mineral Campground. Make a\nright towards South Mineral Campground on a dirt road, which is County\nRoad 7. Go 4.4 miles to the campground. Park your exit vehicle here at\nthe day-use parking lot on the right.</p>\n<p>Getting to the drop-in is only a mile and a half, so this could be\ndone either with a shuttle, or simply by hiking about 30 - 45 minutes.\nIf driving, a high-clearance vehicle is preferred but not absolutely\nnecessary.</p>\n<p>From South Mineral Campground, drive or hike 1.4 miles west on the\ndirt road to a lone stand of 3 small Pine trees on the left. Park here.\nThere is room for 3 cars. Gear up at the car as the approach hike is\nonly 5 minutes. 5mm wetsuit or thicker is recommended.</p>\n<p>From the upper car spot hike diagonally southwest down and across a\nmeadow and across one gulley. When you get to the creek you will see a\n15 foot waterfall that creates a boil room. This is your drop-in.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>It is recommended that everyone in your group has a whistle and to go\nover the whistle signals you will use that day.</p>\n<p>Stream Gage Data for Mineral Creek at Silverton, CO: Site\n09359010<br />\n<a\nhref=\"http://waterdata.usgs.gov/co/nwis/uv/?site_no=09359010&amp;PARAmeter_cd=00065,00060\">http://waterdata.usgs.gov/co/nwis/uv/?site_no=09359010&amp;PARAmeter_cd=00065,00060</a><br />\n<br />\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>R1/J1:</strong> Small tree canyon left, 12-15 feet. The\nsafest way is to rappel on the downstream side of the constriction - the\nnarrowest part of the walls. The rappel rope can be brought around a\nrock horn to bring it several feet over in the downstream direction and\nthe rappeller can stand on a rock knob about 2 feet above the surface to\npush off and release in the downstream direction. The boil room can be\njumped into as well. Someone should test the water depth first. There\nare two common ways to self-escape from the boil room. Swim hard on the\nleft side and grab an underwater corner of the rock with the left hand\nat the constriction and pull yourself through. Or from the back wall,\ntake a deep breath, dunk underwater, push off the back wall and swim\ndirectly underneath the falls and the current should push you out. This\nhas been done successfully many times but there are no guarantees. If\nneither works, your team mates can throw a rescue rope</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>J2:</strong> From left or right, a 10' - 15' jump into a\nshallow pool from one of several perches. Test water depth before anyone\njumps. It may be only 6 feet deep and has a pebble bottom. There is a\nrock ledge jutting out on the right for a lower jumping platform</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>R1:</strong> Log, canyon right, 40' rappel. The safest way\ndown is to stay close to the wall on canyon right. It is very featured.\nThe water is very aerated here and spread wide so not very powerful. The\npool was only 3 feet deep but enough to jump on one's back/pack once\nnear the bottom</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>R2:</strong> Pinch point, canyon right, 35' rappel</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The 5th obstacle of note is a multi-tier cauldron/slide into a pool,\nwhich appears to be a nicely contoured slide down a red sandstone chute.\nUnfortunately, it is not a smooth ride and better to climb down on\ncanyon right. The sandstone is surprisingly grippy here and with the\navailable hand holds is not very difficult to down climb. This drops\nends in the Cauldron, which is a swim. Log strainers occasionally block\nthe exit of this narrow section. At least one kayaker has drowned here;\na memorial for him is just above you along the rim.</p>\n<p>After down-climbing a beautiful 30 foot wide gentle cascade, you will\nsee Porcupine Creek entering from the right. This is the bottom of the\nmiddle section. Creek your way down for about 1/2 mile until you\nencounter another boil and the beginning of the lower section, or hike\nout creek left to your car.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a\nhref=\"http://ropewiki.com/Canyoning_in_the_Colorado_San_Juan_Mountains_Book\">Canyoning\nin the Colorado San Juan Mountains Book by Ira Lewis</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<p>2014-08-31: Descended at 65cfs.
