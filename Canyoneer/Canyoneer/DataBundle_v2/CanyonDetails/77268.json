  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>Waterfall Creek Canyon in more like a gorge as it does not have any\n\"slot\" sections. It is however, a pretty waterfall overlooking the\nBrindabella region of New South Wales. Access is easiest (not\nnecessarily easy) from the ACT.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>The drive in includes ~23km on unsealed roads near the Blue Range\nCamp Ground. The canyoning.org.au website details directions that are\nrelatively easy to follow using your cars odometer. The first section of\nthe road is easier to drive by following the signs for Blue Range\ncampground, rather than turning left earlier as the forum suggests. The\nentire road was in good condition in November 2023 and we were able to\nreach the departure point in a standard Subaru Forester. Admittedly, we\ngot close to bottoming out on some sections of the road.</p>\n<p>The short approach is scrubby to say the least. Follow a bearing of\nabout 25 degrees from the car. The short walk ~700-800m is full of nice\nspiky bushes so wear some long sleeves and pants unless you want to look\nlike you've been attacked by cat once you've finished the canyon. Stay\nclose to the steep drop-off to the left on the way in and out for the\nleast spiky way to the creek (see attached GPX file).</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>The first abseil is from a tree with a new-looking sling and mallion\non RL. It is not 20m as some reports may say. If you descend 20m be\nprepared to do a dodgy down-climb ~6-8m that would probably be\nequivalent to ~grade 8-10 lead-climbing. Abseil almost 30m to reach the\nnext flat section.</p>\n<p>Climb down a little on the RL then cross over to RR. Continue down\nthe RR to the second abseil at the next drop ~45m. We could only find an\nold sling and mallion around a tree well to the RR. This was a\nridiculous a bush-bash abseil. If there is a bolt or sling closer to the\nwater, it would be better to go with that.</p>\n<p>The anchor for the third abseil is to the RR however, we could not\nsee this from the second abseil. Abseil from here about 25m onto a small\nledge.</p>\n<p>The next anchor (slings with pitons) for the fourth abseil is just on\nthe RR and is slightly exposed. Abseil down to a large platform.</p>\n<p>The last abseil is from a large anchor (slings and mallion) on RR.\nThis is about a 45m drop to a shallow pool below.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>The steep exit starts almost immediately after the last abseil on the\nRL. Although a previous report suggests you can exit by following the\nwater-flow, the rest of the creek looks like an atomic mess of\nblackberries (Nov. 2023). Make sure your party likes scree - the first\n~60m of vert is full of it. The ascent becomes choked with stinging\nnettles, blackberries and scrub. Head up to the right (facing uphill)\nand follow the ridge-line back to the top.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<p>Parts of these roads are likely closed during winter due to snowfall\nand poor weather.</p>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<p><a\nhref=\"https://canyoning.org.au/forum/viewtopic.php?f=18&amp;t=87&amp;sid=b68a36e819bb326a11bdb1f261777630\">https://canyoning.org.au/forum/viewtopic.php?f=18&amp;t=87&amp;sid=b68a36e819bb326a11bdb1f261777630</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n<p>The canyon was probably originally explored by the National\nUniversity Caving Club. There are several rusted pitons located\nthroughout the waterfall that look quite old.</p>\n<p><a\nhref=\"https://nucc.caves.org.au/locations/canyons/waterfallck/\">https://nucc.caves.org.au/locations/canyons/waterfallck/</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background_1\">Background</h2>\n",
