It is however, a pretty waterfall overlooking the Brindabella region of New South Wales. Access is easiest (not necessarily easy) from the ACT, but possible from NSW\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>The drive in includes ~23km on unsealed roads near the Blue Range Camp Ground. Follow the directions below. The first section of the road is easier to drive by following the signs for Blue Range campground, rather than turning left earlier as the forum suggests. The entire road was in good condition in November 2023 and we were able to reach the departure point in a standard Subaru Forester. Admittedly, we got close to bottoming out on some sections of the road. Access is also possible directly from Picadilly Circus along Two Sticks Road. If the Dingi Dingi Ridge Trail is wet, you will want low range, as it contains several sections of potentially slippery clay. \n<\/p><p>The short approach is scrubby to say the least. Follow a bearing of about 25 degrees from the car. The short walk ~700-800m is full of nice spiky bushes so wear some long sleeves and pants unless you want to look like you've been attacked by cat once you've finished the canyon. Stay close to the steep drop-off to the left on the way in and out for the least spiky way to the creek (see attached GPX file).\n<\/p><p>Getting there:\nFrom Canberra, head out Cotter Road to Uriarra. Turn left onto Brindabella Road. Follow it for approximately 5kms before turning right into Uriarra State Forest at Blue Range Road.\nReset your odometer here:\nAfter about 1.2km turn left onto an uphill road with a very rocky start.\nAt about 2.3km at a T-intersection, follow the trail around to the right.\nAt 3.6km there’s an intersection with a track going off to the right, keep heading straight here.\nAt 3.8km find a T-intersection called apple tree corner (signpost on left). Turn right and continue following Blue Range Road up the hill.\nAt 5.2km you will now be out of the pine forest and across the NSW border into the Brindabellas.\nAt 7.2km there’s a 4 way intersection, drive straight through following Blue Range Road.\nAt 9.7km, continue straight ahead at a T-intersection with Two Sticks Road.\nAt 10km ignore the small road going down the hill to the right.\nAt 10.1km there is a mud pit on the road, after heavy rain it can look like a trap but should still be easy to cross in a 4WD.\nAt 11km follow the main road under some powerlines, don’t follow the track up with the power lines.\nAt 12.4km follow a small fire trail heading off down to the right into a valley and back up the other side. It’s signposted as Baldy Range Road if you look down the trail on the right a bit. Its easy to miss this turn.\nAt 12.8km find a roundabout looking intersection with a tree in the centre. Drive straight through the roundabout following Dingi Ridge Trail.\nAt 18.7km is a T-intersection with Webbs Ridge Trail. Turn left here.\nAt 19km find a T-intersection with a large tree in front of you. Turn off to the right around the corner here following the Waterfall Fire Trail (signposted).\nAt 22km arrive at carpark on a small bend going around to the left with a small patch of dirt to park on.\nReverse this route when driving out.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>All slings in the canyon are exposed to harsh western sun. Be prepared to replace all tape anchors in the canyon. \n<\/p><p>The first abseil is from a tree with a new-looking sling and mallion on RL. It is not 20m as some reports may say. If you descend 20m be prepared to do a dodgy down-climb ~6-8m that would probably be equivalent to ~grade 8-10 lead-climbing. Abseil almost 30m to reach the next flat section.\n<\/p><p>Climb down a little on the RL then cross over to RR. Continue down the RR to the second abseil at the next drop ~45m. There are two bolts on ledge on TR, approximately 4-5 along from the waterfall. They are not obvious, and are slightly exposed to access. \n<\/p><p>The anchor for P3 is XX TR, around the corner of boulder on large sloping platform. The location, but not the bolts themselves, are visible from P2. Abseil from here about 25m onto a small ledge.\n<\/p><p>The next anchor (slings with pitons) for the fourth abseil is just on the RR and is slightly exposed. Abseil down to a large platform.\n<\/p><p>The last abseil is from a large anchor (slings and mallion) on RR. This is about a 45m drop to a shallow pool below.\n<\/p>\n<style data-mw-deduplicate=\"TemplateStyles:r1062633282\">@media all and (max-width:720px){.mw-parser-output .content .thumb>div:not(.thumbinner){display:flex;justify-content:center;flex-wrap:wrap;align-content:flex-start;flex-direction:column}}body.skin-vector .mw-parser-output div.thumb>div:not(.thumbinner){font-size:94%;text-align:center;overflow:hidden;min-width:100px}body.skin-minerva .mw-parser-output div.thumb>div:not(.thumbinner){margin:0 auto;max-width:100%!important}<\/style> \n<div class=\"thumb tright\">\n<div style=\"display:table;\">\n<span class=\"mw-default-size\" typeof=\"mw:Error mw:File\/Frameless\">\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>The steep exit starts almost immediately after the last abseil on the RL. Although a previous report suggests you can exit by following the water-flow, the rest of the creek looks like an atomic mess of blackberries (Nov. 2023). Make sure your party likes scree - the first ~60m of vert is full of it. The ascent becomes choked with stinging nettles, blackberries and scrub. Head up to the right (facing uphill) and follow the ridge-line back to the top.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Red_tape\">Red tape<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Parts of these roads are likely closed during winter due to sno\n<\/p>\n\n\n<\/div><div class=\"mw-content-ltr mw-parser-output\" lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><p>wfall and poor weather.
