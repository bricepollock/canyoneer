  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>Portal Canyon is the longest and deepest narrow canyon in the area\nand may rival Zion canyons with its high walls, narrow passage ways,\nrappels, and down climbs. Its character is similar to Death Valley\ncanyons with many down climbs and short drops throughout the descent.\nThis canyon is the longer version of the neighboring <a\nhref=\"Cherry_Canyon\" title=\"wikilink\">Cherry Canyon</a> as half of the\napproach and most of the exit are the same.</p>\n<p>Portal has been descended for more than a decade, by hundreds of\npeople, using natural anchors (such as those described in the beta\nbelow). Please, if you are planning on making a descent, know how to\nevaluate, construct, and manage natural anchors within a technical\ncanyon. Portal is not \"throw and go\" where every anchor is always\nsimple. Every potential descent needs to be prepared with the knowledge\nand equipment to evaluate and construct natural anchors. If you do not\nhave these skills, please learn them beforehand in a controlled-safe\nenvironment hopefully from an experienced source, BEFORE going in Portal\ncanyon. With the proper experience the anchors in Portal are not sketchy\nnor dangerous, and risks of using natural anchors can be can be\neffectively and safely managed.</p>\n<p>This is not the place to pull out the drill and install bolts or\nother fixed anchors. They are absolutely not needed outside of Land\nManager sponsored SAR operations. If you cannot descend Portal without\nthe use or installation of bolts, don't do it, and don't install them.\nLearn the skills to do so without, and come back later.</p>\n<p><strong>Portal Canyon is within the the federally designated Paiute\nWilderness Area.</strong> Please abide by the laws of Wilderness Areas.\nThat means it is illegal use motorized equipment (I'm looking at you\npower drill).</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>From the Virgin River Gorge Campground (Cedar Pocket), it is\nnecessary to drive south on I-15 all the way out of the Gorge in order\nto turn around and head north. Heading north on I-15 through the Gorge,\nwatch for a small (40ft) hill on the right side of the road 2 miles\nafter entering the Gorge. Pull off the road to park in a large dirt and\ngravel area just past the hill.</p>\n<p>Although this canyon is rated A, it is necessary to cross the Virgin\nRiver twice: once to approach the canyon, and once to return to your\nvehicles. Make sure that the flow is not too strong before attempting\nthese crossings. Because the rest of the trip is usually entirely dry,\nit is highly recommended to take steps to have dry shoes and socks for\nuse after crossing the river. Crossing the river in bare feet may be\npossible, or it may be useful to bring an alternate pair of shoes to\ncross the river in, and then leave on the opposite bank of the river in\nthe bushes during the canyon.</p>\n<p>Begin hiking up the wash -- you will return back down this wash at\nthe end of the canyon. When the wash takes a 90 degree right turn, leave\nit and follow a smaller wash uphill and then to the right. This part of\nthe hike starts out hard and gets even more difficult as the average\ngrade up to the start of <a href=\"Cherry_Canyon\" title=\"wikilink\">Cherry\nCanyon</a> is 39%. Roughly follow the GPS track to cross a ridge and\ncontinue to the right (LDC) to the saddle overlooking Cherry Canyon.\nThere is a brief reprieve from the steep approach as you head up the\nCherry Canyon wash from the saddle with \"only\" a 21% grade. Then, leave\nthe wash and head very steeply (49% grade) to the top of the ridge on\nthe right. If you reach the top of the ridge at the right point, you can\nthen contour across the large bowl heading only slightly up hill to end\nup at the second saddle peak just above Portal Canyon. Descend a short\ndistance into the canyon itself.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>Portal Canyon has a good variety of rappelling; short and long\nrappels, highly technical rappels, flat and easy walls, anchor building,\nand meat anchor opportunities. Many of the rappels in here are fairly\ntechnical and it is much more challenging than neighboring Cherry\nCanyon. This canyon has alot of Face-Bashers (rappeling over and around\nlarge chokestones that abruptly cuts under into a free hang), so be\nready for alot of awkward starts (and awkward middles).</p>\n<p>The beginning section has around 8 short rappels, separated by\nscenic, deep curvy slots. It has numerous down climbs on smooth polished\nrock. There are a few places where rappelling could be avoided by\nsending the group down on a meat anchor and spotting the last person as\nthey slide down. As of March 2015, this section was flood damaged, and\nall but one of the anchors were washed away (many of which we found\nfarther down, sometimes still attached to the anchor tree which was\nuprooted and washed away). So be prepared to build anchors.</p>\n<p>The middle section has two long rappels. The first long rappel is\naround 175' and (as of March 2015) was anchored by a large, sturdy\ncairn. The rope pull is difficult here; make sure to avoid leaving any\nunnecessary knots or biners on the rope. Although the drop is 175', it\nwould be a good idea to use a pull strand of at least 200', in order to\nstart the pull farther back where it is easier.</p>\n<p>The second long rappel in the middle section drops around 150'. It is\ndifficult to tell from the top if the rope touches the ground or not.\nSpecial care should be taken to make sure the rope does not get tangled\nin trees at the bottom (going down with the rope bag on your harness\nrather than tossing it might be a good idea). It may be possible to\navoid the trees and loose rock at the bottom of this rappel by going\nhalfway down, exiting the rope on a tiny pothole, and traversing around\na slanted ledge RDC; however due to the smooth polished rock and the\nlack of handholds, this would be extremely dangerous.</p>\n<p>After the two largest rappels, is some long, flat wash walking with a\nfew easy down climbs.</p>\n<p>The final section contains 6-8 rappels between 15 and 80 feet each.\nMany of these rappels were bolted as of March 2015. It looks as though\nyou are only a few feet away from the end of the canyon, although there\nare still several rappels between you and the exit.</p>\n<p>The last rappel is a large, flat, steep wall; an easy and fun rappel.\nIt is anchored by two bolts on the rock LDC drops 110'-115' out of\nPortal Canyon into the main wash. A single 200' rope (or two 100's) is\nnot enough to get you all the way down this. We tossed 100' of rope\nwhich looked like it was 2' above the ground from the top, but in\nreality it was more than 10' above the bottom. You will need 220' total\nfor this one.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>The last rappel in Portal Canyon exits into a large wash. Head down\nthis wash and it will start to narrow, eventually leading to a small\nrappel in what is labeled as Bonus Canyon. This rappel can possibly be\ndownclimbed as a 5.3, or there is an anchor high LDC. If you plan to\ndescend <a href=\"Mayday_Canyon\" title=\"wikilink\">Mayday Canyon</a> in\nthe future, it may be worthwhile to decide whether your group can climb\nup this rappel with packs. If so, the bypass around Bonus Canyon is\nunnecessary.</p>\n<p>Continue out of Bonus Canyon and rejoin the wash you traveled up on\nthe approach. Turn right at the river to return to the place where you\ncrossed it, cross the river again, and retrace your steps back to your\nvehicle.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a\nhref=\"https://www.stavislost.com/hikes/trail/portal-canyon\">https://www.stavislost.com/hikes/trail/portal-canyon</a></li>\n<li><a\nhref=\"http://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.233156960090765.55706.179244358815359&amp;type=3\">Las\nVegas Slots Facebook Beta</a></li>\n<li><img src=\"book.png\" title=\"book.png\" alt=\"book.png\" /><a\nhref=\"http://ropewiki.com/User:Las_Vegas_Slots_Book?id=Portal%20Canyon\">Las\nVegas Slots Book by Rick Ianiello</a> : Portal Canyon</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a\nhref=\"http://www.everytrail.com/trip_pictures.php?trip_id=2348561&amp;code=\">EveryTrail\n5 Oct 2013</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>{{#ev:youtube|v=QOB3I6HWE0Y}}</p>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n",
