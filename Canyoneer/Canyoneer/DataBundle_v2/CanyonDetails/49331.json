Summit Creek appears to be spring-fed and seems to sport significant flow all year.  Kayakers run this one in high water, but it may be low enough to be safe for canyoneering late in the season (?).  There appear to be two particular sections of interest on the creek:  a series of falls between 1300-1500ft elevation on land owned by the Columbia Land Trust-- and a second series between 1600-1800ft on Yakama Reservation Land. This page describes the lower section of the creek. \n<\/p>\n<ul><li>Visiting the upper canyon likely requires permission from the Yakama Nation.
