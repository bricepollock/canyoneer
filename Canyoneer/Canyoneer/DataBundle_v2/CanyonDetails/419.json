You have a good chance of seeing bighorn sheep up here. \n<\/p><p>The crux of the canyon is a 260-300ft headwall multi-pitch rappel near the bottom of the gully. It can be done with a 300ft rope but there is a high likelihood of your rope getting stuck, so it's definitely recommended to do it in 2 stages.\n<\/p><p>This is a long hike with a bit of gain so be prepared. If you don't really like hiking and are on the hunt for lots of fun rappels and the most effort-reward ratio then you might not enjoy this route. \n<\/p><p>It is a nice hike in a beautiful area with a challenging headwall multi-pitch rappel.\n<\/p><p><b>Note:<\/b> the KML map shows Brennen's alternate (sneak) approach which is FAR shorter and less climbing up.\n<\/p>\n<meta
