Please do not descend this canyon until August or later<\/b>\n<\/p><p>East Canyon Creek is a short canyon with three rapid-fire drops into beautiful pools. The final drop takes you into a deep pool and a short beautiful set of narrows before exiting into the Cispus River. This route could be combined with other nearby canyons, such as Davis Creek or Dark Creek, for a full day of canyoning.\n<\/p>\n<ul><li>As always, do not jump unless you've scouted the pool first.  Creeks are very dynamic.  The place which was a good jump last year may no longer be if the pool is filled in with rocks, sand, impaling logs hidden under the surface, etc.<\/li><\/ul>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Park on the shoulder of FR-23.  Bushwhack 0.5mi to the rim of the canyon and then descend 200' into the canyon via a steep draw just upstream of R1. (Alternately, find a good place to rappel in.) Note, the track that goes directly east is misleading as the contours push you left and down and make it very difficult and unpleasant to sidle over to the drop in. It is recommended to head a couple hundred feet south on pavement and then start your bushwack arcing south and easterly to the drop in. There are several hills and dales. \n<\/p>\n<ul><li>Future explorations: it might be interesting to try an alternate entrance. Drop a car on FR 2322 (or, if it exists, follow the 618 spur north) and enter via the tributary creek. The trib had low water in late July 2022, but would net you  1 more rappel. This might be a slightly shorter approach.<\/li><\/ul>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>R1: 20' rappel from tree DCL, or 15’ jump DCL or 30’ jump DCR into deep wide pool. From 30' shallow entry technique is needed. \n<\/p><p>R2: 30’ Rappel from a boulder pinch DCL or 30’ jump DCL some years. The fun rappel line is done by pulling the webbing to the right to rappel through the rabbit hole into a rain room and then proceed down a low angle cascade in the flow. It is grippy and easier than it looks. Last person will have to rappel dry on the left though in order to pull the rope. The anchor may be underwater in high flow, so be prepared to rebuild the anchor every year. As of summer 2023, the pool below was only 6-8 feet deep in most places but there was a 10' hole under the whitewater. Take extra caution when jumping.\n<\/p><p>R3: 60’ off bolts high DCL. Use caution accessing the bolts. This is a very rare opportunity to short rope into a deep and wide pool that is typically 20-25 feet deep with no hazards.  Short roping up to 20' can be done comfortably as the bottom 20' is a vertical wall.  There is also a great high jump opportunity from a wide ledge about 20' down that makes for a 40’ jump. In low flow can be rappelled in the flow using an alternate anchor DCR off a pinch or deadman you will have to make. The current at the bottom of the rappel tends to push people away from the base of the falls, so it's recommended to extend the pull side ahead of time.  This allows you to pull from a better position on the far side of the pool.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Continue through the short set of narrows until you reach the Cispus River. Traverse the downriver along the bank for about 300 yards (~0.2mi) before cutting uphill on a faint game trail through the brush. The brush clears up once underneath the tree canopy and follow the obvious game trail upward about 200ft to the top of the hill. The trail mostly disappears at this point, although it's a fairly flat easy bushwhack about 0.25mi back to your car.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Red_tape\">Red tape<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>None.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Beta_sites\">Beta sites<\/h2><\/div>\n<ul><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http:\/\/www.waterfallsnorthwest.com\/nws\/falls.php?num=5302\">Confirmed waterfall from WaterfallsNorthwest.com<\/a><\/li><\/ul>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>July 2023\n<\/p><p><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external free\" href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/--SbDq-5_JI\">https:\/\/youtu.be\/--SbDq-5_JI<\/a>\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Background\">Background<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>This canyon was first descended on 7\/15\/2018 by Jake Huddleston and Pt Choate.\n<\/p>\n\n\n<\/div>","quality":3.8,"vehicle":"Passenger","months":["Jul","Aug","Jun","Sep"]}
