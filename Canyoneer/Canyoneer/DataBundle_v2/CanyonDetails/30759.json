  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>East Canyon Creek is a short canyon with three rapid-fire drops into\nbeautiful pools. The final drop takes you into a deep pool and a short\nbeautiful set of narrows before exiting into the Cispus River. This\nroute could be combined with other nearby canyons, such as Davis Creek\nor Dark Creek, for a full day of canyoning.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>As always, do not jump unless you've scouted the pool first. Creeks\nare very dynamic. The place which was a good jump last year may no\nlonger be if the pool is filled in with rocks, sand, impaling logs\nhidden under the surface, etc.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>Park on the shoulder of FR-23. Bushwhack 0.5mi to the rim of the\ncanyon and then descend 200' into the canyon via a steep draw just\nupstream of R1. (Alternately, find a good place to rappel in.) Note, the\ntrack that goes directly east is misleading as the contours push you\nleft and down and make it very difficult and unpleasant to sidle over to\nthe drop in. It is recommended to head a couple hundred feet south on\npavement and then start your bushwack arcing south and easterly to the\ndrop in. There are several hills and dales.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Future explorations: it might be interesting to try an alternate\nentrance. Drop a car on FR 2322 (or, if it exists, follow the 618 spur\nnorth) and enter via the tributary creek. The trib had low water in late\nJuly 2022, but would net you +1 more rappel. This might be a slightly\nshorter approach.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>R1: 20' rappel from tree DCL, or 15’ jump DCL or 30’ jump DCR into\ndeep wide pool. From 30' shallow entry technique is needed.</p>\n<p>R2: 30’ Rappel from a boulder pinch DCL or 30’ jump DCL some years.\nThe fun rappel line is done by pulling the webbing to the right to\nrappel through the rabbit hole into a rain room and then proceed down a\nlow angle cascade in the flow. It is grippy and easier than it looks.\nLast person will have to rappel dry on the left though in order to pull\nthe rope. The anchor may be underwater in high flow, so be prepared to\nrebuild the anchor every year. As of summer 2023, the pool below was\nonly 6-8 feet deep in most places but there was a 10' hole under the\nwhitewater. Take extra caution when jumping.</p>\n<p>R3: 60’ off bolts high DCL. Use caution accessing the bolts. This is\na very rare opportunity to short rope into a deep and wide pool that is\ntypically 20-25 feet deep with no hazards. Short roping up to 20' can be\ndone comfortably as the bottom 20' is a vertical wall. There is also a\ngreat high jump opportunity from a wide ledge about 20' down that makes\nfor a 40’ jump. In low flow can be rappelled in the flow using an\nalternate anchor DCR off a pinch or deadman you will have to make. The\ncurrent at the bottom of the rappel tends to push people away from the\nbase of the falls, so it's recommended to extend the pull side ahead of\ntime. This allows you to pull from a better position on the far side of\nthe pool.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>Continue through the short set of narrows until you reach the Cispus\nRiver. Traverse the downriver along the bank for about 300 yards\n(~0.2mi) before cutting uphill on a faint game trail through the brush.\nThe brush clears up once underneath the tree canopy and follow the\nobvious game trail upward about 200ft to the top of the hill. The trail\nmostly disappears at this point, although it's a fairly flat easy\nbushwhack about 0.25mi back to your car.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<p>None.</p>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a\nhref=\"http://www.waterfallsnorthwest.com/nws/falls.php?num=5302\">Confirmed\nwaterfall from WaterfallsNorthwest.com</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<p>July 2023</p>\n<p><a\nhref=\"https://youtu.be/--SbDq-5_JI\">https://youtu.be/--SbDq-5_JI</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n<p>This canyon was first descended on 7/15/2018 by Jake Huddleston and\nPt Choate.</p>\n",
