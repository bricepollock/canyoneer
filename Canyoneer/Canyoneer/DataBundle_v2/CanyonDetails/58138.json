  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>Cheerio Canyon is among the last major slot canyons to become\ndocumented in the Southwest United States. While the canyon is\ntechnically straightforward, it is unique in that prior expeditions have\nfailed to find an exit route - meaning all ropes must be left in place\nand ascended in order to exit the canyon.</p>\n<p>If you don't have strong ascending skills, or are one of those\ncanyoneers that believes you'll be fine with just a single prusik, you\nare not ready for this canyon. On the other hand, if you are a vertical\ncaver, and know how to use, say, a frog system, this canyon will make\nfor a fun day.</p>\n<p>You need to bring 2 x 200ft ropes and 2 x 50ft ropes.</p>\n<p>The first group to document this canyon ate an entire box of Honey\nNut Cheerios during their descent and ascent, hence the name.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>Find a suitable parking space on the road near the drop-in point.\nThere is a large parking area with viewpoint about 1 mile east on the\nhighway. Drop in down a 100ft hill, coming out above a metal wash\ntunnel. You are in the main wash. Follow it down for about 20\nminutes.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>Follow the wash. You will shortly pass several easy downclimbs, and\nthe canyon will slot up. Put on your harness at the first rappel. If you\nhaven't read it yet, DON'T PULL YOUR ROPES ON ANY RAPPEL. You will be\nascending all of your ropes. It is recommended to tie a figure-8 knot\ninto each anchor. No double stranding/toss-n-go here, kids.</p>\n<p>R1: 30 feet. Single bolt on right side. No friction points. Don't\npull your rope.</p>\n<p>R2-R5: A four-stage rappel: 50 feet, 10 feet, 10 feet, 30 feet, all\nclose together. One 200 foot rope will cover all of these (tied into the\nfirst anchor). Bolts for a rebelay at the tope of last stage. Did I\nmention that you must not pull your rope?</p>\n<p>R6: 15 feet. No bolts, no webbing. We built a bollard anchor, then\ndisassembled it afterwards. Could be downclimbed, but likely not\nupclimbed - which means you will not escape this canyon. By the way,\ndon't pull your rope.</p>\n<p>R7-10: Another four-stage rappel: 30 feet, 40 feet, 20 feet, then 60\nfeet. One 200 foot rope, figure-eighted to your anchor, single strand,\nwill reach the bottom. There are bolts at the top of the last stage to\ncreate a rebelay. If you don't know what a rebelay is, please don't do\nthis canyon yet. PS. Don't pull your rope...</p>\n<p>After this last rappel, 10 minutes of walking will bring you to The\nGreat Intersection, an area where four slots converge! There is a keeper\npothole only a minute upcanyon you can look at. Downcanyon continues for\nmaybe 30 minutes. For about 20 minutes, you can follow the canyon down,\npast easily reversible downclimbs. Here, the canyon hits its narrowest\npoint, where both your shoulders may touch the opposing walls. The\ncanyon has been documented until the point marked on this page's map, a\nleft curve with a shelter/sandstone cave on the right. Beyond this the\nslot continues briefly before opening - it is not yet documented what\nlies in this mysterious section of slot.</p>\n<p>Satellite maps and Google Earth offer no hope of an exit from these\nlower reaches of this slot canyon complex. Fixing a rope before running\nthe canyon might allow for an exit, but walls easily exceed 200 feet,\nare totally vertical, and filled with loose rock. By far the easiest and\nsafest option is to retrace your steps and ascend all the ropes that you\nhave left in place. You didn't pull your ropes, right?</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>Ascend your ropes using your excellent frog system that you purchased\nand practiced with well in advance, of course, and follow your steps\nback to your car. Keep in mind that ascending is significantly slower\nthan descending, and your exit will probably take twice as long as your\ndescent.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<p>Navajo Nation canyons are closed, and several that are open\n(Waterholes, West Canyon, Big Canyon, etc.) require permits. This canyon\nis apparently closed to non-native persons.</p>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n<p>The first descent is unknown. The author's party's first descent,\nwhich is the first documented descent, discovered bolts at each rappel\nwhich were presumably placed by the first descenders. Bolting is illegal\non the Navajo Reservation, as is descending canyons (mostly).</p>\n<p>Canyons are closed on the reservation partially because, decades ago,\nthere were several costly rescues of canyoneers. Currently, rescues are\nless common, but many Navajo believe that outsiders are responsible for\nthrowing trash on the reservation's hiking trails and slot canyons.\nWhile frustrating, there are plans by Navajo to require permits for ALL\nforms of hiking on the reservation. Please be a respectful\nhiker/canyoneer, and don't throw your trash. You can support your\ncanyoneering community's representation to the good people of the Navajo\nNation by picking up trash from hiking trails and slot canyons.</p>\n",
