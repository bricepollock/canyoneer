Looking\nfor a chill day with some swimming and jumps between technical outings?\nGo no further.</p>\n<p>Have your flotation dialed on this one as there are some long swims.\nWetsuit definitely a good idea as you will be spending a lot of time in\nthe water. Harness, ropes, etc. not necessary as of 2021, but bring a\nhelmet per scrambling about on slippery rock.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>There are several areas in Fools Canyon which would be dangerous in\nhigh flow. Use caution in the early season.</li>\n<li>For the first descent in a given year, it may be wise to bring a\nshort rope and harness. Logs washed downstream can get jammed in\nconstrictions. More debris fills in behind them to create a natural dam.\nSometimes, they can get quite large. Technical gear provides options\nshould you need them.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>Park at a pullout on either side of the bridge (47.31275, -123.45230)\nand hike down into the creek. Suit up and walk in. There's an easy way\ndown on the south side just upstream of the bridge.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Checkpoint</strong> is the creek just under the bridge.</li>\n<li><strong>Optional</strong>: drop a shuttle car at the exit (47.30299,\n-123.46395). There were a couple of pull-offs with room for one or two\nvehicles.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>Just head downstream. It's your typical creek walk at first, until\nthe Statsop River enters DCR. The flow will double. Just below this,\nsuddenly the creek narrows up. You are entering the Fools Canyon. For\nthe next 1.3mi, pass through some lovely narrows. You'll be walking,\nwading, rock-hopping and swimming. Scenery is great with sections of\nbeautiful polished bedrock. There are some long water-filled corridors,\nwhere, with sufficient flotation, you can jump into the current and ride\nthe flow. You'll occasionally have to hop out to warm up, bypass some\nsmall rapids, or climb up and over obstacles. There's lots of jump\npotential.</p>\n<p>Here are some way-points to mark your progress:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Some distance into the canyon, watch for a small waterfall DCL.\nImmediately after it is a chimney-like natural arch on the same side.\nMight be fun to climb up above and rappel down through it.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Floating directly under a bunch of large blown-down trees.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>A long thick steel cable lays in the water. Avoid the temptation to\ninvestigate too closely - it has lots of wetsuit ripping spurs on\nit!</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>A large boulder blocks the entire creek with water flowing past it\non both sides. This could be a spicy spot in high water.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Swim down a long narrow corridor.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>The canyon opens a bit with gravel bars on both side, making a nice\nlunch spot.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Then the canyon takes a left and enters another narrows. This\nnarrows is a very long and very deep.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>When you get to the far end, you'll realize why the narrows were so\ndeep. The entire canyon is blocked by rockfall that must have taken\nplace in the last couple of years judging from the lack of moss\n(pre-2020). The pool just before reaching this natural dam must be 20ft+\ndeep. The dam is easily bypassed on the DCL side next to the cliff. You\ncan alternately scramble your way through the (short) boulder maze to\nreach <em>Fools Falls</em> - an easy 3ft cascade.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Below the dam, make your way through an area of slippery rocks and\none last swim before the canyon walls fall back.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p><strong>Suggested exit</strong>: Upon swimming the last pool in the\nnarrows, the canyon opens up. Climb out onto the rocks DCL and locate a\ngully/drainage entering here. Start your way up the climber's right side\nof the gully, breaking off almost immediately to climb up the nose of a\nridge. Follow game trails upwards (easy) for 100ft or so to a relatively\nflat bench. Bear left a bit on a gentle ascent until you reach the road.\nMostly open forest and few obstructions. Once on the road, walk (or\nshuttle) 1mi back to your car at the bridge.</p>\n<p>(Jun 2021 - couldn't identify drainage. Bushwhacked straight up from\n~150ft after the canyon exit, steep but after not too long it\ndrastically plateaus-off, as you head into the forestry trees trend\nslightly left and up a easier climb to meet the road at the closest\npoint. 20mins - much quicker than I had expected).</p>\n<p><strong>Alternative exit</strong>, taken from original beta:</p>\n<p>When you emerge from the lower end of the canyon continue downstream\nabout a quarter mile. There is a very crude road (too rough even for\nfour wheel drive) running closely along side the left side of the river.\nThis road is not readily visible from the river so you will have to\nscramble a very short distance up the river bank to find it. Once on the\nroad, follow it upstream as it parallels the river. It soon goes uphill\nand turns east. When you come to a good dirt road bear right, and you\nwill be back to Forest Service Road 2341 in a quarter mile. Turn left to\nreturn to your vehicle.</p>\n<p>Either way, by the time you're back at the road you'll be missing\nthat cool canyon water!</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<p>None, but be aware of active logging in the area. No issues with\nparking at the approach or exit.</p>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><img src=\"rwl_en.png\" title=\"rwl_en.png\" alt=\"rwl_en.png\" /><a\nhref=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20210527212206/www.canyoneeringnorthwest.com/FoolsCanyon/Fools_Canyon.php\">CanyoneeringNorthwest.com</a>\n: Fools Canyon</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<p><a\nhref=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/pnwcanyoning/permalink/10160090983180789/\">https://www.facebook.com/groups/pnwcanyoning/permalink/10160090983180789/</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n<p>From canyoneeringnorthwest:</p>\n<p>The name “Fools Canyon” was coined by Gary Korb, the author of “A\nPaddler’s Guide to the Olympic Peninsula”.
