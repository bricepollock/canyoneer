The Silent Pool is not a Cave system but a fantastic slit canyon, sheer walls about 50 feet (~15 metres) high and 3 feet (~1 metre) apart with a mighty river coursing along the bottom. The canyon starts in a series of 4 waterfalls of about 10 - 20 feet (3 - 6 metres) each and the water really whirls. The final section appears to act as a syphon coming up under the Silent Pool. This would be a sight to see during flood and a really good through trip could be taken in a dry season. It would be good practice for a fierce river cave.<\/i>\n<\/p><p><i>The system is not 1\/4 mile (~400 metres) long but I would say closer to 100 yards (~91 metres). It occurs immediately downstream of the junction of the Nymboida and the Deer Park Rivers for those who wish to locate it.<\/i>\n<\/p>\n\n\n<\/div>","rappelCountMax":null,"months":["Oct","Nov","Dec","Jan","Feb","Mar","Apr"],"latitude":-30.3086,"version":"2a94ee9a79ed9e34ee56cad4e9900264c166b26068f7d8c703c25eb8de1c22dc","quality":5,"technicalRating":null,"geojson":null,"rappelLongestMeters":null,"longitude":152.5275,"url":"https:\/\/ropewiki.com\/Silent_Pool","waterRating":null,"timeRating":null,"riskRating":null}
