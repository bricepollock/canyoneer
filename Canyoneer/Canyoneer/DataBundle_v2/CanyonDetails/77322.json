The Silent Pool is not a\nCave system but a fantastic slit canyon, sheer walls about 50 feet (~15\nmetres) high and 3 feet (~1 metre) apart with a mighty river coursing\nalong the bottom. The canyon starts in a series of 4 waterfalls of about\n10 - 20 feet (3 - 6 metres) each and the water really whirls. The final\nsection appears to act as a syphon coming up under the Silent Pool. This\nwould be a sight to see during flood and a really good through trip\ncould be taken in a dry season. It would be good practice for a fierce\nriver cave.</em></p>\n<p><em>The system is not 1/4 mile (~400 metres) long but I would say\ncloser to 100 yards (~91 metres). It occurs immediately downstream of\nthe junction of the Nymboida and the Deer Park Rivers for those who wish\nto locate it.</em></p>\n"
