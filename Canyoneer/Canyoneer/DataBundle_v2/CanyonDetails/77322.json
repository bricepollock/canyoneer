The Silent Pool is not a Cave system but a fantastic slit canyon, sheer walls about 50 feet (~15 metres) high and 3 feet (~1 metre) apart with a mighty river coursing along the bottom. The canyon starts in a series of 4 waterfalls of about 10 - 20 feet (3 - 6 metres) each and the water really whirls. The final section appears to act as a syphon coming up under the Silent Pool. This would be a sight to see during flood and a really good through trip could be taken in a dry season. It would be good practice for a fierce river cave.<\/i>\n<\/p><p><i>The system is not 1\/4 mile (~400 metres) long but I would say closer to 100 yards (~91 metres). It occurs immediately downstream of the junction of the Nymboida and the Deer Park Rivers for those who wish to locate it.<\/i>\n<\/p>\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nParsed by mw‐api‐ext.codfw.main‐6779cc57fc‐65c7h\nCached time: 20240914192007\nCache expiry: 2592000\nReduced expiry: false\nComplications: [show‐toc]\nCPU time usage: 0.006 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.007 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 21\/1000000\nPost‐expand include size: 0\/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 0\/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 2\/100\nExpensive parser function count: 0\/500\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0\/20\nUnstrip post‐expand size: 0\/5000000 bytes\nNumber of Wikibase entities loaded: 0\/400\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%    0.000      1 -total\n-->\n<\/div>","timeRating":null,"rappelCountMax":null,"vehicle":"4WD","months":["Oct","Nov","Dec","Jan","Feb","Mar","Apr"],"technicalRating":null,"rappelLongestMeters":null,"name":"Silent Pool","rappelCountMin":null,"longitude":152.5275,"url":"https:\/\/ropewiki.com\/Silent_Pool","shuttleSeconds":null,"waterRating":null,"version":"f5d4282efc2074e2ccbddb1c0b43442be17bef9d7ed73dd6293d88531354c5f9","latitude":-30.3086,"geojson":null,"riskRating":null,"id":77322}
