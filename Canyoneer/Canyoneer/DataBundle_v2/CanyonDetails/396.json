  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>A magnificent granite gorge hidden away in Big Tujunga; considered to\nbe the best canyon in the San Gabriels. Debris from the Station Fire in\n2009 has clogged much of the canyon, though it is slowly being flushed\nout. This canyon normally exits through the upper part of the Big\nTujunga Reservoir. The water levels in here fluctuate a great deal in\nthe course of a year. As recently as 2011 the reservoir was filled in\nall the way back to the mouth of Josephine Creek, which meant you were\nswimming in the reservoir on the egress for about 3/4 of a mile. If you\nare planning on running Fox Creek and it has been raining in So-Cal in\nthe recent past, it may be advisable to check the reservoir levels prior\nto dropping-in. This can be done by hiking a short distance down the Big\nTujunga Canyon Trail to the first switchback where you have a largely\nunobstructed view of the end of Fox Creek. (34.301137 -118.175145) You\ncan also check reservoir levels from Angeles Forest Highway (N3), which\nruns roughly parallel to Big TJ Canyon Road but at a higher elevation.\nYou can also check the flow volume of Fox Creek easily from Big TJ Road,\na little less than a 1/2 mile past the trailhead gate (3N27) just before\nBig TJ Road ends at Angeles Forest Highway. (34.298136 118.165889)\nAlternatively, the \"Express Exit\" will take you back to the approach\nroad soon after the main gorge, and this avoids all the issues with the\nlong slog out the normal exit.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<h3 id=\"shuttle\">Shuttle</h3>\n<p>Consider leaving a shuttle vehicle at the \"Big Tujunga Canyon Trail\"\ntrailhead at 34.297487 -118.177062 which is also the <a\nhref=\"Josephine_Creek\" title=\"wikilink\">Josephine Creek</a> exit trail,\nbut failing to do so only adds 0.6 miles and 230ft of gain. Historically\nthere has been some vehicle damage and theft along Big Tujunga\ntrailheads, so keep any valuables out of sight, no matter where you\npark.</p>\n<h3 id=\"fire_road\">Fire road</h3>\n<p><img src=\"Gff_approach.jpg\" title=\"The fire road hike\" width=\"240\"\nalt=\"The fire road hike\" /> Park in the small parking area where 3N27\nmeets Big Tujunga Canyon Road; (this is the same trail head as for <a\nhref=\"Fall_Creek\" title=\"wikilink\">Fall Creek</a>, <a\nhref=\"Classic_Canyon\" title=\"wikilink\">Classic Canyon</a>, <a\nhref=\"Kafer_Canyon\" title=\"wikilink\">Kafer Canyon</a>, <a\nhref=\"Little_Fox_Creek\" title=\"wikilink\">Little Fox Creek</a>, and\nothers). 34 17.82'N 118 10.20'W Do not block the gate to 3N27, your\nvehicle will be ticketed. Follow 3N27 down to Big Tujunga and then cross\nBig Tujunga while still heading mostly up stream to find the\ncontinuation on 3N27 on the other bank. Continue up 3N27 for 930ft of\nelevation gain until you come to a saddle with white rocks on the left\nside. To the left of the trail you will have a view of the 100' \"Great\nFall.\" 34 18.927'N 118 10.276'W You will have hiked 4.1 miles from the\ngate.</p>\n<h3 id=\"bushwhacking_traverse\">Bushwhacking traverse</h3>\n<p>Descend to the drainage (Little Fox Creek) on the left/west side of\nthe fire road, across the granite slab, then ascend up following animal\nruns through the thick brush to a plateau. Climb gradually on the\nplateau, reaching thinner brush, then traverse west to a sharp ridge,\ngenerally slowing ascending up as you traverse. This part of the\napproach is navigationally tricky and failing to stay high enough will\nresult in getting cliffed out. Head for 34.31593, -118-17692 and you\nwill be centered on the sharp ridge, being able to see both sides and\nthe top of the gully (below) will be just off to the West.</p>\n<h3 id=\"gully_to_r1\">Gully to R1</h3>\n<p>If you navigated correctly, there should be a small gully on the West\nside of the sharp ridge. Proceed west down this gully, carefully past\nsome poison oak, into Fox Creek This gully is primarily loose rock and\nscree, with several down-climbs. About 3/4 of the way down, there is a\n20 foot downclimb that now has webbing tied around a tree DCL, and it is\nadvisable to rappel, as the downclimb can be dangerous. 12/20/15 - I\nleft a rope set as a double strand at the downclimb section which\nreaches the bottom. A good idea to wear a helmet in this section, as\nthere is so much loose rock. After reaching Fox Creek, head downstream\nover numerous logjams, 1/4 mile to R1.</p>\n<h3 id=\"ridge_to_r1\">Ridge to R1</h3>\n<p>You can also carefully continue down the sharp ridge, with some\nscrambling in spots and varying amounts of exposure. Generally the ridge\ntop is clear of brush in a path and has some animal runs on it. It a\ncouple spots you will have to go slightly off the ridge to the West side\nto avoid thick brush. At the knob 34.31352, -118.17920 make sure and\nclimb back up to the ridge top, otherwise you may wind up off on a spur\nridge to the West, and on crazy steep terrain. Continue South along the\nridge reaching a 30 foot tall granite slab face. This face has a crack\nlip that can be walked down back to a small saddle with a granite knob\njust beyond it. To the West of this saddle is brush filled ramp with a\nbig dead tree visible at the bottom which is actually in Fox Creek.\nDescend this ramp angling to the South (hopefully following some trimmed\nbushes) toward 34.31234, -118.17973, which is the location for rappel 1.\nDon't go straight down the ramp, as there is a cliff face at the bottom\nagainst Fox Creek. By angle to the South over a tiny spur ridge you will\nreach a shallow chute with no brush, past a rock cairn, and continue\ndown another shallow chute all the way to Fox Creek without any\ndrop-offs or downclimbing. The views on this ridge are amazing, so if\nyou are not afraid of some exposure, it's definitely worth the trip! It\nalso seems to be faster to R1 than the gully and creek approach.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p><img src=\"Gff_firstbig.jpg\" title=\"First big rappel R2\" width=\"320\"\nheight=\"320\" alt=\"First big rappel R2\" /> The descent is more or less\nstraight forward:</p>\n<p>The first 8 rappels are in close proximity to each other with little\nwalking in between. The 100ft \"Great Falls\" rappel is exactly that, from\nthe lip of the waterfall. If you use a 200ft rope, it will be necessary\nto extend the pull side with webbing to accommodate distance from anchor\nto water and any fireman belay you might want wish to give members of\nyour party. Much of the trail in the lower sections of canyon is similar\nto the East Fork of the San Gabriel River or the longer walking sections\nin lower Eaton canyon, which is to say you'll be mostly travel the creek\nbed, tromp through weeds and hop along rocks for the majority of the\ntechnical canyon between the first 8 rappels and the final rappel.</p>\n<p>Rap 1: 33' off a tree canyon left, with about 15 foot of vertical\ndrop over a big boulder. This is possibly down-climbable on the dry\nslabs left or right but looks very sketchy. The water course itself\nextremely slimy, so down-climbing the chimney where the water flows is\nlikely to fail.</p>\n<p>Rap 2: 47' off bolts canyon right or off a pinch point in canyon\ncenter. There are also several other large rocks just up-canyon that\ncould be used to for an anchor.</p>\n<p>Rap 3: 15' slung rock and pinch point canyon left under a roof, over\na big overhanging boulder.</p>\n<p>Rap 4: 28' bolts canyon right.</p>\n<p>Rap 5: 26' bolts canyon left, hidden from view behind a tree.</p>\n<p>Rap 6: &lt;110' Bolts canyon right or &lt;105' bolts canyon left.\nThere has historically been issues with stuck ropes on this rappel when\nusing the old canyon RIGHT bolts . If you use these bolts extend the\nwebbing out to better your rope-pull angle. The newer bolts on canyon\nleft solve this issue and is a much more enjoyable rappel. (2020 note:\nafter using both multiple time I had not noted any issue with pull from\neither set of bolts) In heavy flow it is not advisable to attempt the\ntricky down-climb to access the lower bolts canyon left without a\ncompetent belayer, or rappel off the tree canyon left to the bolts. A\ndouble strand rappel from bolt canyon left with a 200' rope will leave\nthe rope ends dangling approx. 2-3 feet above the bottom of the gorge,\nso be prepared to take a small fall into the (shallow!) pool below, or\nextend the pull strand as mentioned above.</p>\n<p>Rap 7: 31' bolts canyon right</p>\n<p>Note: In high flow, the narrow chute beyond R8 and hallway can have\nserious hydraulic force, possible entrapment issues, and thus be the\ncrux of this canyon If the flow is too high for safe passage, bypass by\nclimbing up DCL. A partner assist may be need to get up from the canyon\nkelp to the first ledge. The climb has some exposure, but is generally\neasy movement. Once on top of the buttress, you will see a large shallow\ngully beyond it. There is a 2 bolt (widely spaced) anchor on the ridge\noverlooking the hallway; rappel about 80 feet. Using this will avoid all\nthe hydraulic issues for slot below the R8 bolts and put you at the\nbottom of R8 well DCL of any flow rooster-tails.</p>\n<p>Rap 8a: 25/80' bolts canyon right: It's a tricky start to this one,\nas it's overhanging directly into the blunt of the flow. There is a\nchockstone about 10 feet down that can catch your leg and it loves to\ncatch the rope if you did not throw it out far enough. Continue into a\nnarrow chute, then 20' in a narrow/level hallway, to another set of bolt\nDCR. There is also at least one other chockstone to trip over in the\nhallway. In high flow this hallway can be dangerous, and you may need to\nstay on rope to reach the 2nd set of bolts, or continue to combine R8a\nand R8b together. Rope pull on this rap can be tricky as well, but\nsomehow the rope end never seems to get caught on the chockstone 10 feet\nbelow the anchor.</p>\n<p>Rap 8b: 40' bolts canyon right: down the low angle and wide slab to\nthe end of the money section of GFotF.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>From the bottom of this rap, it is about and hour hike to the final\nrappel. Alternately, you can do a much shorter hike down the creek to\nthe express exit which takes you back to the approach road (also takes\nabout an hour). Then do <a href=\"Fall_Creek\"\ntitle=\"wikilink\">Fall_Creek</a> on the way out.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Rap 9: 70' Horizontal tree in canyon center down the watercourse\n(NOTE as of APR2023 this tree is gone). Or horizontal tree on sloping\nslab canyon left, which can be a bit sketchy downclimbing to the webbing\nanchor. Warning: do not sit on, lean on, or touch this tree in any\nfashion (this is rather silly advice since you need to hold onto the\ntree to safely get to the webbing anchor). It is zealously guarded by\nsome of the most vicious ants around.</p>\n<p><br />\nAll the below photos were from 2011 when Fox was Class C. The flow here\nis right on the edge of being unrunnable, not advisable for those\nwithout significant class C experience. </p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<h3 id=\"express_exit\">Express Exit</h3>\n<p>About 1/4 mile past the main gorge, Little Fox Creek comes in from\nthe left and just beyond at 34.3108, -118.1757 is a wide and shallow\ngully on canyon left. Head up that gully a ~100 feet avoiding a large PO\nbush, and traverse right to a tree with webbing hanging down from it\nover a slab cliff face. Climb the steep ridge beyond the tree up to the\nmain ridge line. Then follow the animal runs to a small saddle, crossing\nover and continue following these animal runs down slightly and\ntraversing over toward a saddle with the approach road on the other\nside. It's a short climb up from the end of the traverse to the saddle\nand the road is only 20 feet vertically below that saddle.</p>\n<h3 id=\"standard_exit\">Standard Exit</h3>\n<p>Proceed down Fox Creek until its confluence with Big Tujunga\nCreek,(erroneously labeled 'mill creek' on other sources of beta) then\nturn left (up stream/east--34.301569 -118.176478) and hike or swim up\nBig Tujunga. After rounding a ridge, there will be a large flat bend to\nyour right/south (Big TJ Creek-LDC); head into that flat area. Finding\nthe small, steep use trail that joins up with the main exit trail from\nJosephine Creek can be difficult. (especially in the dark) It will be on\nyour right side as you walk up from Big Tujunga Creek, and LDC for\nJosephine Creek, which is the tributary to Big Tujunga at the large flat\nbend. You'll find the use trail before you head into the dense bushes of\nJosephine Creek. The trail is very steep. After about 150ft of elevation\ngain on the small use trail, it should join with the slightly larger\nexit trail for Josephine Creek. There are many short cuts on the exit\ntrail, but they all lead to the same place until the exit trail starts\nheading south near the top of the ridge. At this point, stay on the\nlargest trail until a short 60ft trail to the road branches off, or\nuntil the exit trail ends at a parking area southwest of the ridge you\njust climbed.</p>\n<figure>\n<img src=\"Gff_water.jpg\" title=\"Floating debris is common near the end\"\nwidth=\"320\" />\n<figcaption>Floating debris is common near the end</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<p>This area of the forest was closed due to the station fire recovery\norders from August 2009 through June 2012.</p>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><img src=\"rwl_en.png\" title=\"rwl_en.png\" alt=\"rwl_en.png\" /><a\nhref=\"http://brennen.caltech.edu/advents/grtfox.htm\">Chris Brennen's\nAdventure Hikes (St Gabriels)</a> : Great Falls of the Fox</li>\n<li><a\nhref=\"http://www.ucanyon.com/canyon-beta/southern-california/angeles-national-forest-big-tujunga/great-falls-of-the-fox-3br-iv\">uCanyon</a></li>\n<li><a\nhref=\"http://www.theatsteam.com/adventureworks/great-falls-of-the-fox.html\">ATS</a></li>\n<li><img src=\"rwl_en.png\" title=\"rwl_en.png\" alt=\"rwl_en.png\" /><a\nhref=\"http://canyonchronicles.com/great-falls-of-the-fox?kmlidx=205701186783545362755.0004e401590933a30bb52\">CanyonChronicles.com</a>\n: Great Falls of the Fox</li>\n<li><img src=\"rwl_en.png\" title=\"rwl_en.png\" alt=\"rwl_en.png\" /><a\nhref=\"http://ropewiki.com/User:Super_Amazing_Map?id=Great_Falls_of_the_Fox_-_California_(San_Gabriels)\">Super\nAmazing Map</a> : Great Falls of the Fox</li>\n<li><img src=\"rwl_en.png\" title=\"rwl_en.png\" alt=\"rwl_en.png\" /><a\nhref=\"http://summitpost.org/canyoneering-in-great-falls-of-the-fox/362408\">SummitPost.org</a>\n:</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><img src=\"rwl_en.png\" title=\"rwl_en.png\" alt=\"rwl_en.png\" /><a\nhref=\"http://candition.com/canyons/great-falls-of-the-fox\">Candition.com</a>\n: Great Falls of the Fox</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n<p>First recorded canyoneering descent on Aug.9, 1997, by Garrett\nReisman, Simone Francis, Troy Sette, Steve ??, Tom ?? and Chris\nBrennen.</p>\n",
