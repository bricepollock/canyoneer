The top section of the canyon is very angular and squared off with sharp edges and Jenga Like rock stacked on itself. As you descend the rock turns from solid angular quartzite looking rock to conglomerate and finally smoothed surfaced and polished granite where the slide section begins. Be prepared for drops up to 80' (some with very sharp edges), lots of down climbing, scrambling &amp; creaking before and after the slide section.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>There are many beta sites I have found to recommend the bottom up approach. In my experience and the experience of others you are cheating yourself out of half of the canyon and most of the rappels offered in this unique drainage. Below is the top down and bottom up approach options as noted:\n<\/p>\n<ul><li>When traveling off paved roads and in remote locations you should have a spare tire, tire repair kit &amp; a tire pump! Roads in this area have sharp rock &amp; cactus that can easily puncture worn tires.<\/li><\/ul>\n<p><br \/>\nFrom the Apache Trail Highway (AZ 188) turn North-East on Globe Young Highway (AZ 288) \n<\/p><p>Drive 6.98 Miles to Cherry Creek Road (dirt road turn off) and turn right (watch your speed &amp; watch for cows, wild horses &amp; other wildlife!!!)\n<\/p><p>Take this road (F South 203 Road) approximately just over 10 miles (33.70426, -110.83498) – This is the Turn off for the car shuttle (reset your odometer)\n<\/p><p>Continue East\/North-East approximately 5.40 miles to drop your Exit vehicle (33.767250, -110.813110.) This is the same parking location for an optional bottom up approach and you will miss about 7 rappels (not recommended unless you do not have high clearance). There are a few small pull-outs off the road to take advantage of, but anywhere in this area will work.\n<\/p><p>If you decide on the full route, drop your exit vehicle and drive back down the road you came approximately 5.40 miles and turn right (33.70426, -110.83498) (road turns into Forest service road 203A). This road varies in condition based on the time of year but generally a High clearance vehicle will always be needed and 4x4 will help but may not be required for the savvy driver! Drive approximately 4.5 miles until you reach a Ridgeline and parking area\/turn off (33.75391, -110.86682) Park your vehicle here and note the narrow jeep trail headed down north toward the canyon. \n<\/p><p>Follow the jeep trail as stated above down hill until you reach the Y in the trail. Cut down through openings in the brush to reach the drainage, just below.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Once you reach the start of the canyon you’ll notice the pink and granite like angular rock features that step steeply down to the first rappel. \n<\/p><p><b>R1<\/b>: 70’ RDC from BFT and then down climb on the right – Sharp edges and chance of rope retrieval issues here. \n<\/p><p><b>R2<\/b>: 50’ LDC from a bush rooted in crack\n<\/p><p><b>R3<\/b>: 45’ RDC from bush, possibly down climbable -slick-\n<\/p><p><b>R4<\/b>: 25’ RDC off a small tree, or sporty down climb on right - easier without a pack on&#160;\n<\/p><p>After the 4th drop you will start to see more and more conglomerate rock bolder’s increasing in size. This is the relatively short bolder field. Start off on the right of the drainage headed across the rock scree slope then cut to the left for easier travel through the bolder field. Be prepared to go slow hear if you have a large group and\/or inexperienced canyoneers uncomfortable with down climbing &amp; scrambling. Partner captures will come in handy here.\n<\/p><p>The bolder field will come to a sudden end as the conglomerate bolders fade to slabby slick rock.\n<\/p><p><b>R5<\/b>: 55’ from a pinch point on BFR\n<\/p><p><b>R6<\/b>: 60’ center canyon from a pinch point on BFR \n<\/p><p><b>R7<\/b>: 60’ from rock pinch\n<\/p><p>After R7 you will reach the confluence of Deep Creek and a sharp right turn (dog leg) - this is an easy down climb, although slippery. If you see water running here its probably a good indication of the quality of the slides you will soon be upon. Great place to filter water if needed, but it not known if this spring runs all year. Continue down the canyon creaking through small wades and light brush under huge trees.\n<\/p><p>The slide section begins when the slabby slick rock and conglomerate turns to carved polished granite, larger pools, and wide open hallways. Find a shaded flat spot, have some lunch, down your wetsuits, and get ready for a water park nestled deep within Bull Canyon.\n<\/p><p>The slide section is comprised of a multitude of small and large slides ranging from 5’-30’  \/-, wades, and deep swims. The deep carved pools are similar to Seven Tea Cups off the Kern River in California. If you have the option of going with someone who has descended this canyon before it would be helpful to know the sweet spots on a few of these slides and jumps, but using a little common sense and checking depth will go a long way in this section and keep you out of the emergency room.\n<\/p><p>Note: Some of the slides may \n<\/p>\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nParsed by mw‐api‐ext.codfw.main‐6779cc57fc‐bdzjs\nCached time: 20240914191912\nCache expiry: 2592000\nReduced expiry: false\nComplications: []\nCPU time usage: 0.004 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.005 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 6\/1000000\nPost‐expand include size: 0\/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 0\/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 2\/100\nExpensive parser function count: 0\/500\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0\/20\nUnstrip post‐expand size: 0\/5000000 bytes\nNumber of Wikibase entities loaded: 0\/400\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%    0.000      1 -total\n-->\n<\/div><div class=\"mw-content-ltr mw-parser-output\" lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><p>or may not have anchors present.
