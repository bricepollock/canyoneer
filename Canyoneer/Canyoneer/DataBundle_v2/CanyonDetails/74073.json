At the bottom of that big one, the flow is really strong, and some boulders are in the way, not sure of it's possible to get out of it even if it's not deep water. Once you are on this balcony (at the top of the 35m), aim for the next balcony, it has another anchor on its backside, this one allows you to be far away from the water, or to get just near enough to get wet, without being in danger. \n<\/p><p>The next waterfalls also has a handrail option on the left side, as at the start of the pitch the water is very condensed.
