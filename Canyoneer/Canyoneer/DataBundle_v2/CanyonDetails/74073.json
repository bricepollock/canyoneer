  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>Short canyon that always caries a lot of water. Maybe a good option\nfor those who want to experience some high flow without having to do\nsomething very long. The canyon has been equiped in a way that you don't\nneed to abseil through the water.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>Starting at the parking in the Sertig Valley, from where you can see\nthe biggest waterfall of the canyon, walk towards the Ducanfurgga.\nAlready after roughly 200m of denivelation, the path crosses the river.\nFrom there on you can follow the water.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>It starts with two smaller rappels, before going up on the right, in\norder to avoid to do the 35m pitch in the water. At the bottom of that\nbig one, the flow is really strong, and some boulders are in the way,\nnot sure of it's possible to get out of it even if it's not deep water.\nOnce you are on this balcony (at the top of the 35m), aim for the next\nbalcony, it has another anchor on its backside, this one allows you to\nbe far away from the water, or to get just near enough to get wet,\nwithout being in danger.</p>\n<p>The next waterfalls also has a handrail option on the left side, as\nat the start of the pitch the water is very condensed. The last two\npitches are quite easy.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>Walk back to the parking.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n",
