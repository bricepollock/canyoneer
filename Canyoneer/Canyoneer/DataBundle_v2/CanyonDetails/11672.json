A metal arrow marker indicates the turn off left.<\/li>\n<li>Follow the footpad under the cliff until you're in Rainbow Ravine<\/li>\n<li>Proceeding up Rainbow Ravine requires several tricky rock scrambles that border on low grade unprotected climbs. You may wish to run hand lines and haul packs for less capable party members. New joiners find the following 2 tricky:\n<ul><li>Dry boulder crack river left (right next to wall going uphill), good but hidden holds, you may need to wedge your foot into a tight crack right on the 1st step<\/li>\n<li>Wet boulder river right (left next to wall going uphill), get out of the water on small wet ledge then traverse right via 2 carved footsteps\/good hand grips above<\/li><\/ul><\/li>\n<li>Where the Rainbow Ravine gully splits higher up, head up the left branch.<\/li>\n<li>At the waterfall at the top (a couple of treated pine logs have been dug into the ground as steps), walk to the right along the ledge under a small cliff line to the other gully until you get near the creek, and then up a ramp to the left and back over the top to the left gully.<\/li>\n<li>The old route (the one with the treated pine log steps) is discouraged due to erosion and higher and objective risks that can easily be avoided via the newer walking route<\/li>\n<li>Proceed up along a well trodden route to Camels Saddle. A metal arrow marker indicates the route direction (i.e. right). An alternate \"unofficial\" (well-worn in 2024)  exit route branches to the left at this point, which requires a 20m abseil, or 2 x 10m abseils. This abseil route is a good 1h quicker than descending Claustral Brook, avoids re-entering water and brings you directly to the side-gully entry\/exit track.\n<ul><li>Please note the \"unofficial\" aka \"emergency\" exit <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https:\/\/www.openstreetmap.org\/way\/1210711261\">OSM<\/a> track<\/li><\/ul><\/li><\/ul>\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nParsed by mw‐api‐ext.codfw.main‐6779cc57fc‐9vsr7\nCached time: 20240914192014\nCache expiry: 2592000\nReduced expiry: false\nComplications: [show‐toc]\nCPU time usage: 0.009 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.011 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 16\/1000000\nPost‐expand include size: 0\/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 0\/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 2\/100\nExpensive parser function count: 0\/500\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0\/20\nUnstrip post‐expand size: 0\/5000000 bytes\nNumber of Wikibase entities loaded: 0\/400\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%    0.000      1 -total\n-->\n<\/div><div class=\"mw-content-ltr mw-parser-output\" lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><p>is more accurate than the current GPX  \n<\/p>\n<ul><li>Proceed down onto the saddle and then turn left down a steep downhill until you reach Claustral Brook.
