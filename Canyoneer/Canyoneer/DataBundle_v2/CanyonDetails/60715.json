  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>Saw this unnamed creek and thought it looked interested in Google\nEarth. Shared it with Scott Brown who droned it in November 2019. Haruka\nand myself went through it to get a closer look. The drone adds about 3x\nlength to each drop. Lol</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>We parked acrossed the exit and walked 5 miles. 1 mile on FS 28 and\nthen crossed Pinto creek via a log. Walked the old logging road that\ndead ends at the drop in, roughly at 3,300 elevation. The 28 was in\ndrivable shape.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>Flow was lower than expected. Walked creek to the first complex of\ndrops at 3200 elevation.
