  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>Although it has a nice, flowing creek and interesting geology, Lava\nCanyon is not a destination canyon. What it is is a wide, open, rocky\nwash that serves as a perfect jumping point to reach Carbon Canyon - if\nthat is your ultimate destination.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>In his book Todd Martin describes an easy to find and follow rafter\ntrail traveling up the right side (canyon left) on a low slope above the\nwatercourse of Lava Canyon. I had a difficult time locating the trail at\nfirst, though it becomes more distinct the farther you travel up canyon.\nSpend zero time trying to locate this trail. Instead, take the rafter\ntrail directly to the creek and hike up from there. There are no\nobstacles of any kind next to the creek and the hiking is more\npleasant.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><img src=\"rwl_en.png\" title=\"rwl_en.png\" alt=\"rwl_en.png\" /><a\nhref=\"http://ropewiki.com/User:Super_Amazing_Map?id=Lava_Canyon_-_Grand_Canyon\">Super\nAmazing Map</a> : Lava Canyon</li>\n<li><img src=\"book.png\" title=\"book.png\" alt=\"book.png\" /><a\nhref=\"http://ropewiki.com/User:Grand_Canyoneering_Book?id=Lava_Canyon\">Grand\nCanyoneering Book by Todd Martin</a> : Lava Canyon</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><img src=\"rwl_en.png\" title=\"rwl_en.png\" alt=\"rwl_en.png\" /><a\nhref=\"http://candition.com/canyons/lava-canyon\">Candition.com</a> :</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n",
