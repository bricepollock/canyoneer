There are two primary objectives here:\n<\/p><p>1) Lower Dog Creek (3C III) - The recommended route which visits the best part of the canyon, doing an out &amp; back from the bottom. This route is described on a <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https:\/\/ropewiki.com\/Dog_Creek\">separate page<\/a>.\n<\/p><p>2) Upper Dog Creek (3C IV) - This page describes a full descent of Dog starting from the radio towers atop Cook Hill.  This option is long and strenuous and takes most of a day. The upper drainage is wild, overgrown, seldom-visited, and rugged. As one canyoneer puts it: \"The two miles of river walking in upper Dog Creek are beautiful, but likely not worth the 4hrs it takes to reach the next waterfall. While the first waterfall is spectacular, you may change your opinion after you slog your way through the creek for 30min and discover you have only traveled 0.1 miles.\"  This option is a high pay-to-play.\n<\/p><p>A number of other approaches to Dog have all been tried and none of them are good.\n<\/p>\n<ul><li>The Meditation Pool sequence in the lower canyon can be extremely dangerous in high flow.<\/li>\n<li>The checkpoint is the last waterfall on Dog Creek which is about a 1min walk from the exit parking area.<\/li>\n<li>Water Catchment: 3.75mi^2.<\/li><\/ul>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading3\"><h3 id=\"Shuttle\">Shuttle<\/h3><\/div>\n<p>Drop a car at the exit and head east on Hwy 14 for 0.6mi. Turn left on the Cook-Underwood Rd and drive north for 3.4mi. In the strangely named town of Mill A, turn left on Bunker Keys Rd for 1.1mi to a junction and turn left onto the powerline road. Follow this up through several switchbacks to park near the radio towers at the saddle.
