class=\"mw-content-ltr mw-parser-output\" lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><p>Three Corner Creek is a lesser tributary of Rock Creek located about 6mi northwest of Stevenson, WA. The creek is named for Three Corner Rock: a nearby landmark and former lookout site above Rock Creek Pass. Three Corner has three nice waterfalls and a beautiful upper canyon; it's a nice short adventure near Portland.\n<\/p><p>Three Corner is visited regularly by waterfall photographers. If leaving anchors, please use natural colors or black to blend in.  A bright red sling atop a waterfall is most irksome to photographers.\n<\/p>\n<ul><li>Watershed: 1.65mi^2.

The roads are rocky, but 2WD friendly if driven carefully. In 2023, there was a tree down on the last section of logging road, forcing groups to park early and hike the rest of the way on foot. Upon reaching the parking area at the end of the road (approximately 45.74540, -122.02184), follow the road a short distance further, then break off to hike north down the ridge directly to R1. The route passes through an older clear cut area. \n<\/p>\n<ul><li>If you don't have a shuttle, there's an alternate bushwhack approach. Approach was scouted in 2023.<\/li>\n<li>Road cleared to upper shuttle parking as of 21 Apr 2024<\/li><\/ul>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>The standard approach is to go directly to R1 - although there's an optional 6ft drop into a pool about 5min upstream. \n<\/p>\n<ul><li>R1: ~120ft.\n<ul><li>Low water: anchor is a tree DCL. Rappel 120ft through a short slot and down into a plunging amphitheater. Beware sharp rocks at the edge; edge protection is tricky.

Bypass\/downclimb DCR or rappel.<\/li><\/ul>\n<ul><li>R2: 80ft from tree DCL. In low flow, an interesting network of channels\/chutes\/potholes become visible at the base of the falls. There are several miniature arches. It may be possible to rappel down one of the chutes.<\/li><\/ul>\n<ul><li>R3: 60ft.\n<ul><li>Low water: boulder near the center of the creek.<\/li>\n<li>High water: tree DCR for a line out of the water.

After 5min, enter a a clear-cut area. Continue north wherever's easiest until you intercept the logging road.
