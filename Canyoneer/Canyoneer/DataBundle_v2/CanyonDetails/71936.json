  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>A nice short canyon run along the Molalla River suitable for an\nafter-work adventure. It could also be combined with others in the area.\nThe area was lightly singed by the Labor Day fires of 2020, but is not\nnearly as bad as Pelkey Creek to the south.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Checkpoint: Check the waterflow from the road or walk up to the last\nfalls (R3).</li>\n<li>Watershed: 1.7mi^2.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"parking\">Parking</h3>\n<p>From Molalla, take S Feyrer Park Rd east for ~2mi. Upon crossing the\nriver, turn right on S Dickey Prairie Rd for ~5mi. Turn right and\nre-cross the river to the west side to enter the Molalla River\nRecreation Area. Turn left and follow the S Molalla Forest Rd for ~5mi\nto a large pullout with a restroom on the right.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>Backtrack north along the Molalla River Road for 0.2mi and turn off\nleft on an old road (now trail). Walk around the gate and continue\nupward for about 0.8mi. Bear left at all junctions. The location of the\nfirst rappel is obvious from the road. Suit up and drop in just above\nit.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>R1: 45ft. More rope may be required as the anchor (tree DCR) is set\nsome distance back.</li>\n<li>R2: 15ft. Tree DCR.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Walk down the creek a ways.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>R3: <strong>Shotgun Falls</strong> from tree high DCL. You'll need\nto exit the creek and climb up well before the falls due to a mass of\nfallen trees. About 140ft of rope is needed from the anchor. Use caution\nwhen throwing your rope as there may be people below. Beware loose rock\nnear the top of the falls.</li>\n<li>Just downstream is a final short drop. This might be another rappel\nsome day, but as of 2020 it's a mess of logs and woody debris. Bypass on\nuser trail DCL instead.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>From Shotgun Falls, follow the user trail DCL out to the road. (For\nextra bonus points you can wander through the culvert under the road).\nFollow the road back to your car (300ft).</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<p>None.</p>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>There are a couple of other short waterfalls quite a bit further up\nthe creek, but they may not be worth your time.</li>\n</ul>\n",
