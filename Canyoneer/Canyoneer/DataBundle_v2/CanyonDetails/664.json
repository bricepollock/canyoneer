After two bumpy miles bear right; at 2.8 miles is a short spur road on the right - park here or drive down the spur to park at the end to begin the hike. High clearance required.   In wet conditions, 4x4 may also be required. As the road travels directly through a wash for a short distance, it is assumed that the road may be impassable after heavy rains.\n<\/p><p><br \/>\n<b>Approach 1<\/b>\n<\/p><p>There are no real trails present in the area that I am aware of, and there are a few possible ways to get above the technical section, so I will describe what I think is a relatively easy and safe route of ingress.  From the end of the spur road follow a light use trail along a barbed wire fence down to the south fork of Oak Spring Canyon. Cross the creek and climb up the other side, then back down again into the main fork, then up the other side again (it may be a good idea to leave a rock cairn for yourself in the main drainage to mark where to exit the canyon on the return hike) of the main fork of the canyon to access the slopes above the creek to the north. Follow the system of ridgelines to the northwest until you reach an elevation of slightly more than 4000 feet and the way becomes more level - you may find, lose, then find again a few light game trails as you go making travel a bit easier. Continue hiking to the west until you reach a small, but significant side drainage - if you have been lucky enough to find the game trails you will probably spot the first of a handful of bright pink marking tape ties in a tree on the opposite side of the drainage which leads you to a light use trail that continues up and southwest. Follow the marking tape until it fades away, then begin to head down the slope on your left to reach the canyon floor below where possible.\n<\/p><p><b>Approach 2<\/b>\n<\/p><p>From the end of the spur road follow a light use trail along a barbed wire fence down to the south fork of Oak Spring Canyon.  Follow Oak Spring Canyon up to last rappel. Continue up Class 2 rock and scree gully to meet upper portion of Oak Spring Canyon. Approach 2 advantage is less distance, less elevation gain, and cooler if doing canyon on a warmer day. Disadvantage of Approach 2 is will have to boulder and bush wack up drainage and up the class 2 rock and scree gully, as well as likely get feet wet.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2
