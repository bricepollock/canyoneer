The lower section is a great option to introduce beginners - while still technical, it is relatively shorter\/warmer\/not as committing as the slot canyons in the Blueys\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading3\"><h3 id=\"Water_levels\">Water levels<\/h3><\/div>\n<ul><li>214003 <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https:\/\/waterinsights.waternsw.com.au\/15523-illawarra\/river-data#214003\">Macquarie Rivulet @ Albion Park<\/a><\/li><\/ul>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>The parking lot at Clover Hills Road is very small. Try to consolidate people in to the least number of cars at the parking at the bottom of the pass, then proceed to Clover Hills Rd.\n<\/p><p>Do not try to access the upper canyon directly from the main road (red path on the sketch map). National Parks have a really clear closure notice: <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https:\/\/www.nationalparks.nsw.gov.au\/visit-a-park\/parks\/macquarie-pass-national-park\/local-alerts\">Closed areas: Restricted access to Macquarie Rivulet.<\/a> A good way to do the upper section is to head in via Clover Hill Rd (like you would for the lower section). Once you cross the rivulet you follow a rough track on the south (true right) up to Clover Falls. From the base of these falls cross over and head up an even rougher track on the north (true left) to the top. A short scramble gets you to the cliff top and the first abseil is very close by. The other advantage of this route (beyond not breaking the law \/ further inflaming tensions with local landowners) is you don't need to do a car shuffle.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<ul><li>Lower section\n<ul><li>R4c: please note sizeable rocks have been easily dislodged ~midway during this pitch.
