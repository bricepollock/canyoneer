They\nare sustained and dark with long swims/lilo pools</p>\n<p>The Lower section as described by Jamieson is the most popular option\nand while the combined upper and lower sections are described as a \"good\nover night trip\" it is easily doable as a day trip with a car\nshuffle.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>For the lower section.</p>\n<p>Car Park: Wollangambe car park next to Mt Willson Fire Shed</p>\n<p>Walk-in: From the fire shed walk west along fire trail toward Du\nFaurs lookout for 300m. Turn left at the second locked gate onto\nThompsons Road/Bogey Holes Trail. Follow this for approximately 2km\nuntil it heads downhill and veers left MGA542886 . Take the walking\ntrack that continues straight that this corner</p>\n<p>Follow walking track to saddle at MGA537885. Then turn right and\nfollow the trail along small creek for approx 1km then up over ridge to\na10m down climb on a fixed rope on large gum tree. Walk down the gully\nand cross Du Faurs creek then immediately climb the other side. Zigzag\nright along ledge then up and back left. Scramble to top then up ridge\nto the top of the big hill.</p>\n<p>Once on top follow the ridge west then descend into the gully and\nfollow this through to the gully and down here through Bell Fry canyon,\nI tricky downclimb down a log that some people may wish to rope up for\n(Anchor bolts on right)</p>\n<p>Once at the junction with Bell creek head downstream, there are some\ntricky down climbs and again some people may prefer to rope up before\nthe start of the canyon proper.</p>\n<p>To do the complete trip combining the upper and lower sections</p>\n<p>Leave a car at the Fire shed then drive to a parking spot on the\nBells Line of Road at Water Trough Hill, MGA 496879 then make your way\ndown one of the ridges to meet the creek via a short side canyon at\nMGA503898</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>There are no absiels in the canyon, though there are some tricky\nclimb downs</p>\n<p>Rope Length: 30 hand/abseil line handy for nonconfident scramblers\nWetsuits: Recommended Lilo: Recommended for poor swimmers Walk in: For\nthe Lower as describes 2.5-4hrs For the Upper 30-45min Walkout: 1-2hrs\nDescent: for lower only 3-4hrs for combined upper and lower 6-8hrs\nQuality: spectaular sustained constrictions V1A2_</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>Exit:. At the Junction with Du Faurs creek head upstream for 800, and\nexit up Joes Canyon, MGA543907, heading left up gully after scrambling\nout.
