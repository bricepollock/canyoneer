  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>Rocky Creek is a beautiful canyon, with some narrow dark slots and\nsome fun slides and potential swimming pools. It is usually done in\naddition to Twister Canyon. It is technically fairly easy, with no\nabseils, but there are a few climb downs and mini-jumps which will\nsurely keep you from getting bored. The beauty of the canyon is reason\nenough to check it out, particularly after already getting an adrenaline\nrush from Twister.</p>\n<p>The slot is narrow dark and beautiful.</p>\n<p>Short hand lines handy for a couple of downclimbs. Wetsuit:\nRecommended Walk-in: 30-45 min Walkout: 40min -1 hour Descent: 2 hours\nreturn</p>\n<p>Elevation Gain: 370m Distance 5 Km</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>Driving there</p>\n<p>Drive along Bells Line of Road to the Zig Zag Railway. Turn right\nhere, then immediately right again along a dirt road (signposted as\nNewnes Forest Road). This crosses the old railway tracks and becomes Old\nBells Line of Road. Follow it until it ends at a T-intersection with\nGlow Worm Tunnel Road. Turn right and follow Glow Worm Tunnel for\napproximately 15kms. Turn right onto the signposted Galah Mountain Road.\nContinue along this road for about 6.5kms to the end where there is room\nfor a reasonable number of cars to park. MGA472138</p>\n<p>Walking In</p>\n<p>Rocky Creek can be reached from the end of Twister Canyon, by\nfollowing the reasonably clear path which continues downstream. If for\nsome reason you want to skip Twister, simply walk from the car park down\nthe well cleared path past the Twister turnoff, and down the gully which\nleads you to the creek below Twister.</p>\n<p>Rocky Creek canyon starts at MGA481134</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>The canyon runs for approximately half a kilometre. While it is\ntechnically easy, with no abseils, there are a few climb downs and\nslides. The majority of the canyon is fairly narrow with high walls on\neither side. Do not jump the first pool. It's shallow and full of leg\nbreakers. Use the downhill through a hole canyon right</p>\n<p>There are a couple of downclimbs in the first section where a hand\nline may be handy for beginners but otherwise easily descended.</p>\n<p>A short distance into the canyon is a small climb down called \"The\nWashing Machine\". Immediately after the washing machine the creek\nfollows a small zig zag around a pot hole in some of the canyon\nformation - this pot hole can be swum into underneath the rock around it\n- you can duck dive underneath the rock, and swim up into it. About half\nway through the canyon section, at a large right hand bend, there is a\ngreat canyon playground - a large rock at the edge of a nice pool. You\ncan jump off the rock, or use the rock as a slide at several different\nplaces.</p>\n<p>A short walk through an impressive canyon section will bring you to\nthe lower sections.</p>\n<p>Some long swims through stunningly sculpture walls brings you down to\nthe junction with Budgary creek where the canyon opens out.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>Exit: There are a few options for exit</p>\n<p>Option 1: Reverse back out the same way (most popular)</p>\n<p>Option 2: From the end of the canyon, where it opens up and the steep\nwalls fall back, continue walking down Rocky Creek for 1km to the big\nrighthand bend, MGA487144. Immediately on the left there is a path which\nleads up a gully. The path is difficult to spot as it is hidden behind\ntrees and bushes when traversing downstream so be careful not to\novershoot it. The first few hundred metres is fairly steep and muddy,\nbut shouldn't be too much of a problem for capable climbers. The path\nwill eventually lead to a big rock slab on the left hand side. This can\nbe climbed and is not overly difficult, but it is fairly steep with a\nbig drop down, so people with a fear of heights may find this difficult.\nHandling or belay may be required. At the top of the rock, there is a\npath which leads off to the left along the top of the gully. Follow this\nand it will eventually lead to a firetrail. Turn left on this firetrail\nand it will eventually lead back to the main road you drove in on,\nshortly before the car park. Turn left and follow the road back down to\nyour car.</p>\n<p>Option 3: Grade 10 rock climb (gear required) starting on river left\n30m past last swim opposite the junction with Budgary crk. 4m up to\nledge. Traverse left (exposed) then 2m up to another ledge. Traverse\nright 100m. 5m up slab then up through upper cliff line to intersect\nCoachwood trail. Left here and contour around Galah Mt back to car.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a\nhref=\"https://ozultimate.com/canyoning/track_notes/rocky_creek.htm\">https://ozultimate.com/canyoning/track_notes/rocky_creek.htm</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<p>{{#ev:youtube|HvD-gZJ8Bx4}}</p>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n<p>David Noble says: the first recorded visit was on a joint SUBW -\nUNSWBWC trip on 4 Dec 76. The party was Bob Sault and Dave Noble (SUBW)\nand Nick Bendelli and Dave Firman (UNSWBWC). Named after the name of the\ncreek it was in. (Kameruka Magazine Vol 15 No 1 - Sept 77).</p>\n<p>Between the first discovery of Surefire Canyon and Rocky Creek, there\nhad been SUBW exploratory trips to the major tributaries of Annie Rowan\nCreek with mixed success. The more obvious Rocky Ck was ignored,\ntemporarily, because stories indicated that it had been investigated and\nno canyons found. On the December 76 trip, the party completed a day\nwalk from the headwaters of the creek (from near Barcoo Swamp). On the\nway down the creek they found an upper section of canyon with a 20m\nabseil. This has later been called \"Sheepdip Canyon.\" On the walk, the\nparty had planned to climb out of Rocky Ck at the side creek that is now\nused as the standard entrance. They arrived at this point at about 5pm.\nDave Noble and Bob Sault went all the way through the remarkable\nconstriction (hoping to find some \"Claustral type\" abseils) and also\nwent a fair way up Budgary Ck looking for a sister canyon before\nretracing their steps.</p>\n<p>Photos of the first recorded visit can be seen here: <a\nhref=\"https://www.david-noble.net/canyoning/wolgan/wolgancanyons.html\">https://www.david-noble.net/canyoning/wolgan/wolgancanyons.html</a></p>\n",
