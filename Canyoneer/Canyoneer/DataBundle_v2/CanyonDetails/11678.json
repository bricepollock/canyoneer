The party was Bob Sault and Dave Noble (SUBW)\nand Nick Bendelli and Dave Firman (UNSWBWC). Named after the name of the\ncreek it was in. (Kameruka Magazine Vol 15 No 1 - Sept 77).</p>\n<p>Between the first discovery of Surefire Canyon and Rocky Creek, there\nhad been SUBW exploratory trips to the major tributaries of Annie Rowan\nCreek with mixed success. The more obvious Rocky Ck was ignored,\ntemporarily, because stories indicated that it had been investigated and\nno canyons found. On the December 76 trip, the party completed a day\nwalk from the headwaters of the creek (from near Barcoo Swamp). On the\nway down the creek they found an upper section of canyon with a 20m\nabseil. This has later been called \"Sheepdip Canyon.\" On the walk, the\nparty had planned to climb out of Rocky Ck at the side creek that is now\nused as the standard entrance. They arrived at this point at about 5pm.\nDave Noble and Bob Sault went all the way through the remarkable\nconstriction (hoping to find some \"Claustral type\" abseils) and also\nwent a fair way up Budgary Ck looking for a sister canyon before\nretracing their steps.</p>\n<p>Photos of the first recorded visit can be seen here: <a\nhref=\"https://www.david-noble.net/canyoning/wolgan/wolgancanyons.html\">https://www.david-noble.net/canyoning/wolgan/wolgancanyons.html</a></p>\n",
