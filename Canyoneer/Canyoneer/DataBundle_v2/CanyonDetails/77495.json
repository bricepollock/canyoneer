Help the Australian canyoning community by contributing track notes to ropewiki.com\n<\/p><p>Most people tend to walk up into the lower section of Hobnail Canyon while doing Bowens Creek South Upper, sure, you get an introduction, and, some pretty bits, but the upper sections are worth doing this as a complete trip.\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Walk along Range fire trail for a short distance from Bells Line until you see the \"parked\" car on the left, and it is here we headed down the steep hill towards Range Creek. We tended left and met a usually dry feeder rocky creek\/chute, that was running, just, making it VERY slippery, a hand-over hand rope assisted with a descent down that chute, to the final short drop into Range Creek.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>A pretty straight forward canyon, creek walking, wades, a swim or two, technically no abseils, through, we did come across one, but found an alternate way down, which was dark and wet. Tends to get choked with flood debris, so be prepared to either tunnel through, or climb over if required.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>The exit is the same as that used for Bowens Creek South Upper, and it is a few hundred metres downstream from where you join onto BCUS.\n<\/p><p>It has some fixed hand line scrambles, a tunnel climb, then two options for the final ascent, a challenging fixed hand line ascent which we have done a few times up a trickling waterfall, or, further around, a steep scramble. From there, it is a gradual uphill back to Range Hill fire trail and back to Bells Line and your car.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Red_tape\">Red tape<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Beta_sites\">Beta sites<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media<\/h2><\/div>\n<ul><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external free\" href=\"https:\/\/www.whungeewheengee.com\/tags\/hobnail-canyon\/\">https:\/\/www.whungeewheengee.com\/tags\/hobnail-canyon\/<\/a><\/li><\/ul>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Background\">Background<\/h2><\/div>\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nParsed by mw‐api‐ext.codfw.main‐6779cc57fc‐vfk2q\nCached time: 20240914191954\nCache expiry: 2592000\nReduced expiry: false\nComplications: [show‐toc]\nCPU time usage: 0.005 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.005 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 21\/1000000\nPost‐expand include size: 0\/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 0\/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 2\/100\nExpensive parser function count: 0\/500\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0\/20\nUnstrip post‐expand size: 0\/5000000 bytes\nNumber of Wikibase entities loaded: 0\/400\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%    0.000      1 -total\n-->\n<\/div>","longitude":150.3645,"waterRating":"B","months":["Oct","Nov","Dec","Jan","Feb","Mar","Apr"],"geojson":null,"permit":"No"}
