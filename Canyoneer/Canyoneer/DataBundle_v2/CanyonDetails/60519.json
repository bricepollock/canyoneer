SUBLIME OVERHANG BEHIND THE VEIL\n<\/p><p><b>R6<\/b>: DCL - 60' from a bolt station. This rappel wraps around the corner to the right. There are several abrasion points here, so rope abrasion management is a must. This anchor is best for moderate flows or lower. There are potential natural anchor options on canyon right for high flow.\n<\/p><p><b>R7<\/b>: DCL - 8' from a single bolt. This drop could potentially be downclimbed. This bolt could also be used as a redirect for the previous rappel.\n<\/p><p><b>R8<\/b>: DCR - 140' from a bolt station. This is a multi-stage rappel to the bottom pool with a large boulder visible. The anchor is not visible from the bottom, take care to not get your rope stuck\/twisted. There is an escape at the base of this rappel. There is also a sketchy escape at the anchor for this rappel (if you\n<\/p>\n\n\n<\/div><div class=\"mw-content-ltr mw-parser-output\" lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><pre>need to retrieve your stuck rope).\n<\/pre>\n<p><b>R9<\/b>: DCR - 60' from a tree.\n<\/p><p><b>R10<\/b>: 100' from a tree in the center of the creek.

There is a quaint campground at the end of this creek, where you may meet some kayakers or canoeists. Please be respectful, as they may not expect to see people coming from above their camp. Swim and wade your way to the opposite side of Kachess Lake (west) by going around the north end of the lake, though certain times of the year you may be able to walk across on dry land. The Little Kachess Trail is just up the west bank of the river. Proceed north for 0.8 miles until you reach a T junction with the Mineral Creek trail (this junction is easy to miss). Take a right at the junction and follow the trail down to the Kachess River. Cross on an obviously placed log that is anchored on both sides of the river. It is a short walk back to the parking area.\n<\/p><p>In low flow (or no flow) times of the year, it's also possible to just walk up the Kachess river drainage back to the forest road, as there is a bulldozer track you can follow.

Many ideas were discussed, with \"Incognito\" canyon ultimately winning the vote. \"Incognito: having one's identity concealed, as under an assumed name.\"\n<\/p>\n\n\n<\/div>","id":60519}
