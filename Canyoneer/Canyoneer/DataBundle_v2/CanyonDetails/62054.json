There's intermittent brush but nothing too bad. Then there's an optional R0, 20', which is easy to bypass DCR.\n<\/p><p>Next up is R1, 75' bush DCL, with an awkwardly placed anchor just above a yucca. This is the banner picture. A fun downclimb through a chute follows. Then R2, 70' tree DCR, has an interesting slot.
