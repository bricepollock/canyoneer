From there it's a short walk along the road to the drop-in point.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Descent begins with three short downclimbs, one of which could be considered an optional rappel. There's intermittent brush but nothing too bad. Then there's an optional R0, 20', which is easy to bypass DCR.\n<\/p><p>Next up is R1, 75' bush DCL, with an awkwardly placed anchor just above a yucca. This is the banner picture. A fun downclimb through a chute follows. Then R2, 70' tree DCR, has an interesting slot. The canyon gets much less brushy as you approach Cow Canyon.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Taking the exit from <a href=\"\/w\/index.php?title=Falling_Leaf_Canyon&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Falling Leaf Canyon (page does not exist)\">Falling Leaf Canyon<\/a> will drop you back at Glendora Ridge Road with a short walk to the parking lot.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Red_tape\">Red tape<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Beta_sites\">Beta sites<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Background\">Background<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Exploration of this canyon was motivated by seeing the main wall from across Cow Canyon while running Falling Leaf.
