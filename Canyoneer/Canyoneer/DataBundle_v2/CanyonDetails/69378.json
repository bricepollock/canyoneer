Published\nfor awareness.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>Dirt road to turn down to trailhead should be doable for most\npassenger vehicle with good tires and driven carefully. All wheel drive\nvehicle recommend to drive down road to trailhead.</p>\n<p>Follow trail #66 up. Eventually leave trail down slope into\ncanyon.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>A few downclimbs.</p>\n<p><strong>R1:</strong> Optional 150' off of large boulder in the water\nflow. Easy to bypass downclimbing RDC or via the watercourse in low / no\nflow conditions.</p>\n<p><strong>R2:</strong> 30' off of tree LDC. Possible challenging\ndownclimb.</p>\n<p>Notable downclimb a few feet after R2. About 10'. Some may want to\nrappel.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>Follow canyon down a few downclimbs. Before it gets overwhelmingly\nbrushy, head up and out of canyon LDC. Hike to trail #66. Follow trail\n#66 down to vehicle.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<p>{{#ev:youtube|v=kI01qzkziAs}}</p>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n<p>First known descent by Nick Clegg, Melissa Gibbons, Jacob Cowan, Cole\nAnderson, and Erek Burek on February 6, 2022.</p>\n"
