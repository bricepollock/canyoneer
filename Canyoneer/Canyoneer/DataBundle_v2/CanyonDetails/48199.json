The canyon starts off with crystal clear pools and rock beds that change colors from rusty red, white, pitch black, to speckles of red and turquoise. There's an inviting crooked corridor, walls that grow over 100ft, ferns that drape from the sides, and trees growing on top of large chockstones. There is a four foot crack where all the flow drains into a roaring chute of water, whiteout, and a siphon in higher flow.\n<\/p><p>The best location for a reference photo is from the bridge on the Eastside Trail at the canyon's exit.\n<\/p>\n<ul><li>Olallie is in a Wilderness area.

A National Park Pass or entrance fee is required for each vehicle. There is additional parking alongside the road just outside the park entrance for those without park passes. Park at the Grove of the Patriarchs parking lot, where there are restrooms. This lot fills up quickly in the summer so it's a good idea to get there early. \n<\/p><p>The hike from Grove of the Patriarchs is well worth it as you can take a 2 minute side trip to a viewpoint for Silver Falls of the Ohanapecosh River. From the Grove of the Patriarchs parking lot, take the Eastside Trail, which starts across the street from the restrooms, 0.5 mi. to a trail intersection. At the intersection go right up Cowlitz Divide Trail 0.2 mi., cross the road, then continue 1.5 mi. to an elevation of 3300 feet. As the trail curves left (46.7723, -121.5693) continue straight through mostly open forest and down, dropping 200 feet in elevation.\n<\/p><p>If doing the Upper Section, continue up the trail to 3700 feet, then bushwack right a short distance. \n<\/p>\n<ul><li>Before dropping into the canyon, please brush off your gear to ensure you aren’t transporting seeds from areas near the parking lot.

Careful of the roots, limbs, and branches as you rappel.  \n<\/p><p>At the base of this rappel, there is a grotto you can climb into.

There are many large logs, rocks, and pinch points that can easily trap ropes when pulled, particularly a pile of wood debris 20 feet up from the bottom. It is recommended for the first rappeller to deploy rope from a bag as they go to avoid dropping a rope into the strainer.
