  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>In the span of one mile, Olallie presents obstacles galore; there are\nat least 16 drops with two major rappel sequences and countless\ndownclimbs. The canyon starts off with crystal clear pools and rock beds\nthat change colors from rusty red, white, pitch black, to speckles of\nred and turquoise. There's an inviting crooked corridor, walls that grow\nover 100 feet, ferns that drape from the sides, and trees growing on top\nof large chockstones. There is a four foot crack where all the flow\ndrains into a roaring chute of water, whiteout, and a siphon in higher\nflow.</p>\n<p>The best repeatable location for a reference photo is from the bridge\non the Eastside Trail at canyon exit.</p>\n<p>Olallie is in wilderness and machine-drilled bolts are prohibited\nwithout a permit. All anchors are natural anchors.</p>\n<p>Your group should come prepared with sufficient natural anchor\nbuilding experience and materials, particularly if you think your group\nmay be the first through this season. Some rappels have limited anchor\noptions.</p>\n<p>Olallie is also pristine - please keep it that way. Ensure your gear\nis clean and dry before entering. If you introduce invasive species,\nthey can destroy the canyon ecosystem.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p><strong>Ensure all of your gear is clean and dry before starting your\napproach. Olallie is pristine, and delightfully sticky as a result - do\nnot be the one to introduce invasive species to this canyon</strong>\nDrive into Mt Rainier National Park proper via the Stevens Canyon\nentrance. A National Park Pass or entrance fee is required for each\nvehicle. There is additional parking alongside the road just outside the\npark entrance for those without park passes. Exit parking is just inside\nthe entrance at the Grove of the Patriarchs parking lot, which includes\nrestrooms. This lot fills up quickly in the summer so it's a good idea\nto get there early. You have the option of a shuttle car which cuts out\n0.5 miles of walking along side a potentially busy road. Set up the\nshuttle (46.7560, -121.5634) and proceed hiking 2 miles up the Cowlitz\nDivide Trail.</p>\n<p>Road Closure: The middle portion of Stevens Canyon Road from Stevens\nCreek to Grove of the Patriarchs is OPEN on weekends &amp; holidays ONLY\naccording to the following schedule: Open on weekends from Friday at\n8:30 pm to Monday at 6:00 am and holidays. Closed for construction\nweekdays from Monday at 6:00 am to Friday at 8:30 pm from Stevens Creek\nto Grove of the Patriarchs parking area. When closed for construction,\nStevens Canyon Road is closed to ALL use, including walking and\nbicycling.</p>\n<p><strong>You will have to park at the grove of the patriarchs use the\nalternate approach on the map when the road is closed.</strong></p>\n<p><a\nhref=\"https://www.nps.gov/mora/planyourvisit/stevens-canyon-road-rehabilitation-project.htm\">https://www.nps.gov/mora/planyourvisit/stevens-canyon-road-rehabilitation-project.htm</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<h3 id=\"upper_section\">Upper Section</h3>\n<p><strong>Before dropping in, please brush off your gear to ensure you\naren’t transporting seeds from areas near the parking lot into the\ncanyon. Please be vigilant about not transporting invasives.</strong>\nFor the upper section, continue on the trail until around 3600'\nelevation, then bushwhack down to the creek. The upper sections will add\non an additional +0.6mi of creek walking, 6+ rappels, spicy downclimbs\nin flow, crystal clear pools, and beautiful rock beds that are speckled\nwith red, white, and turquoise colors.</p>\n<p>There are at least 6-10 downclimbs that can be done as rappels based\non flow and comfort level that are not documented in the beta.</p>\n<p>R1: 30' DCL - tree</p>\n<p>R2: 30' DCR - boulder</p>\n<p>R3: 90' Center - log spanning the creek</p>\n<p>R4: 20' DCR - tree</p>\n<p>R5: 20' Center - log spanning the creek</p>\n<p>R6: 30' DCL - tree. In higher flow, the water forms a curtain that\nyou can swim behind.</p>\n<h3 id=\"main_section\">Main Section</h3>\n<p><strong>Before dropping in, brush all of your gear off to ensure you\naren’t transporting seeds from the areas near the parking lot into the\ncanyon. Please be vigilant about not transporting invasives.</strong>\nThe more technical portion begins at R7. If only descending this\nportion, veer off the trail at the third switchback (46.7723, -121.5693)\nand traverse/bushwhack to the top of first large sequence at 2980'\nelevation (46.7752, -121.5644). There is no evidence of any trail\nhere</p>\n<p><strong>R7, R8, R9</strong> are done in sequence down a large\ncascade.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>R7: 120' DCL</strong> - Two-stage rappel from a tree about\n20' back from the lip. Rappel or controlled slide into a deep pool. This\ndrop can also be jumped from the lip right 30' or by downclimbing past a\ntree against the right wall right to a small ledge 15'. In high flow,\ncheck for hydraulics. Continue on rope across the pool, climb out near\nthe pour over, and continue down to the next pool, which is partially\nfilled in with large rocks.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>* A 200ft rope from this anchor will get you to R9 anchor. However,\nthe rope pull here will likely get caught in the siphon created by the\nboulders in the 2nd pool, so as long as the R8 anchor remains\ntrustworthy, it’s recommended to use it.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>R8: 60’ DCR</strong> - Sling around rocks in the 2nd\npothole.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>R9: 60' DCL</strong> - Webbing around a tree to rappel in\npartial flow. Rock sling from a boulder wedged in a pothole to rappel\ndry.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>R10:</strong> (High Flow) 50' DCL - tree. Scramble up a path\nDCL and rappel from a tree in the center of the canyon. Prepare to be\neaten by a tree, possibly upside down. Careful of the roots, limbs, and\nbranches as you rappel. This rappel is away from the watercourse.</p>\n<p>(Moderate to low flow) Find or build an anchor DCR using the many\nboulders or logs in the watercourse. Note that the creek bends abruptly\nleft past the boulder, so beware of rope pinching which could interfere\nwith retrieval from below.</p>\n<p>At the base of this rappel, look back upstream and look for flow\nstone and some small stalagmites on your right. Enjoy the last bit of\nsun before you enter the corridor and the narrows.</p>\n<p><strong>R11: 15' DCL</strong> - boulder into the narrows. Walk\nthrough a gorgeous corridor with slightly slanted walls for about 50\nyards. Don't forget to look back.</p>\n<p><strong>R12: 100' DCL</strong> - tree DCL.</p>\n<p><strong>R13: 200' DCL</strong> in MULTIPLE stages (Apparition Falls).\nIt is the most technical part of the canyon, and in high flow can be\nvery dangerous. The water here funnels into a narrow chute about 3 feet\nwide. There are many large logs, rocks, and pinch points that can easily\ntrap ropes when pulled. It is advisable to do this rappel in 3 stages of\nno more than approximately 60' each.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>First stage:</li>\n</ul>\n<p>60' from a log DCL to the top of a large wedged log and other debris.\nAt high flows, the concentrated water in the chute is very powerful and\ncan be enough to knock you off your feet. Spray coming in from the sides\nof the chute result in very poor visibility. Stemming above the chute is\nideal, but potentially difficult. Removing your pack and sending it down\nlater on a zipline is highly recommended. It may be possible to redirect\nthe line over a log DCR to avoid the crack entirely. At low flows, the\nchute is pushy but not dangerous, and manageable for most canyoners. It\nis preferable for the first rappeller to deploy rope from a bag as they\ngo to avoid dropping a rope into the strainer.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Second stage:</li>\n</ul>\n<p>20' webbing anchor around the large log/debris pile (room enough for\n2-3 people comfortably, but beware of loose logs/false floor) to a bunch\nof jagged rocks in a flattish corridor.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Third stage:</li>\n</ul>\n<p>50-60' from a log or rocks. Rap down a couple of small drops then\nthrough the final chute in full flow unless stemming above the water.\nAlternatively, this drop can be downclimbed and the final chute jumped.\nBe careful if jumping the final part because ledges protrude on both\nsides.</p>\n<p><strong>R14: 50' DCR</strong> - log</p>\n<p><strong>R15: 30' Center</strong> - log (aka The Mouth Washer). In\nhigh water, the stream flows directly over a large log and unavoidably\ndouses rappellers in the face.</p>\n<p><strong>R16: 25' DCL</strong> - log. The pool below is very deep and\ncan be jumped. Be sure to send a person down to check depth before any\njumps. There is also a cool cave to check out behind the waterfall.</p>\n<p><strong>R17: 20' DCL</strong> - large tree.</p>\n<p>Walk the remaining creek until you hit a footbridge (~10-20 min).\nThere are some downclimbs and nice bedrock to walk on along the way.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>Follow the flat East Side Trail DCR (south) for ~1.5mi back to your\ncar. Near the end you will reach a junction, continue straight to return\nto the parking area. (The suspension bridge to the left leads to the\nGrove of the Patriarchs.) Expect to encounter lots of non-canyoner\ntourists on the last leg of trail; this area is popular on summer\nweekends.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Time and energy-permitting, you might detour to check out the Grove\nof the Patriarchs. It's an impressive stand of old growth trees. Cross\nthe suspension bridge and follow the 0.3mi loop.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<p>Mt.
