  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>There are two distinct sections separated by a 1.2 mile long open\nsandy wash. The upper section starts out with a 30’ downclimb to a\nnearly 300’ awkward rappel that you stem over and from the floor you are\nmet with a 20’ up climb up a flared crack. After this is some sustained\n40’ high stemming and several silo crossings. Challenging stuff typical\nof an R rated canyon. The lower section has very little to offer. It\nfeatures an 800 foot long slot section with some 20’ - 30’ high stemming\nand a few silo crossings, one of which is quite wide and many will need\nto be meat anchored down and are able to walk out. After the short slot\nsection is a short open section that ends in a 70’ rappel. This is\nfollowed by a 0.5 mile non-technical section and a 2.5 mile long exit\nhike fully exposed to the sun.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><img src=\"rwl_en.png\" title=\"rwl_en.png\" alt=\"rwl_en.png\" /><a\nhref=\"http://ropewiki.com/User:Super_Amazing_Map?id=Egypt_5_Canyon_(Top)_-_Escalante\">Super\nAmazing Map</a> : Egypt 5 Canyon (Top)</li>\n<li><img src=\"rwl_en.png\" title=\"rwl_en.png\" alt=\"rwl_en.png\" /><a\nhref=\"http://bluugnome.com/cyn_route/escalante/escalante_egypt-5/escalante_egypt-5.aspx\">BluuGnome.com</a>\n: Egypt 5 - Upper and Lower</li>\n<li><img src=\"rwl_en.png\" title=\"rwl_en.png\" alt=\"rwl_en.png\" /><a\nhref=\"http://bluugnome.com/cyn_route/escalante/escalante_egypt-5/escalante_egypt-5.aspx\">BluuGnome.com</a>\n: Egypt 5</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n",

One person provides a meat anchor for someone to get down then the last person can be assisted by those on the ground with the last part of the drop. All but the last 8 to 10 feet are down climbable where the walls bell out wide. An aggressive partner assist may be needed to get the last person down. Once on the ground walk down canyon a little over 400 feet to the start of the next slot. (Data by bluugnome.com)",

On the other side of the pool is a narrow spot to get through which most people will be able to do so with their head above water. A swim of about 60 feet gets you over to a wide sandy spot.

Depending on conditions and if you are careful you might be able to get off rappel on dry land. It looks like you can easily upclimb out of the canyon from the top of rap 3 on the LDC side but we did not confirm this.
