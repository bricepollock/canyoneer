  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>Yet another canyon coming off the flanks of Mt. Washington. Don't\nexpect jumps, slides, or whitewater.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>Park at Rattlesnake Lake. If you park as close to the Iron Horse as\nyou can get, you'll need a Discovery Pass. Parking at any of the other\nmany parking lots is free, though. Bike or hike the Iron Horse (old\nrailroad grade) trail until you come to Boetzke Creek. Check out the\nflow, stash/lock bikes if you have them, and head uphill following the\nridge on the west side of the canyon. There is no obvious trail, you\nwill have to bushwhack your way up. Watch your steps and go slow as it\nis steep and loose in some sections. A fall may result in a serious\ninjury. Stick to the ridgeline as much as possible, until you're around\n150 ft below the entrance to the canyon, then start cutting across a\ncouple small gulleys to the canyon until you come to near the top of the\nfirst falls. You'll know it if you come to the canyon too low - go\nhigher. If you come in too high, the creek won't look like much of a\ncreek, just a bunch of dense, thorny brush. Check the gps coordinates\nuploaded by Geormorphdan. The bushwhacking is mostly BW3, but it's not\nhard to get yourself into some not-so-fun BW4 or BW4+ if you stray from\nthe ridgeline too much. Use the force, and find the path of least\nresistance, or something.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>From the entrance, head down canyon. The rock is super chossy and\nranges from super sticky and fun to downclimb to slick as snot and not\nso fun to downclimb.</p>\n<p>Note that this canyon requires natural anchor skills. <strong>Bolts\nwill not last in this canyon.</strong> You must be prepared to scout\ndrops, check for anchors for the next drop, look for escapes, etc. After\na big flood, it would probably be smart to have a skilled climber to be\nable to escape. Even then, escaping this canyon would require scrambling\nwith lots of exposure over some of the chossiest rock you can find in a\ncanyon in the region.</p>\n<p>R = right, looking down-canyon L = left, looking down-canyon</p>\n<p>R1: 170 ft - actual drop is close to 140ft, although closest anchor\npoint requires an additional 10ft of rope at a minimum. It could be done\nwith a 300ft of rope.</p>\n<p>R2: 30 ft - Pretty straigtforward, but it maybe difficult to find a\nsuitable anchor point near the drop.</p>\n<p>R3: 30 ft - Obvious anchor spot on a tree on DCL. This could be used\nfor both R3 and R4. Scout R4 before pulling your rope down.</p>\n<p>Tributary comes in from R and approximately doubles the flow</p>\n<p>R4: 60 ft Actual drop is very short, maybe 20 ft. May need to be\ncombined with R3 depending on anchor availability. 130 ft rope is needed\nif combining R3 and R4.</p>\n<p>Landslide comes in from L, filling the canyon with sharp, crumbly\nrock ranging from boulders to gravel</p>\n<p>R5: 20 ft - This could be downclimb on DCR; however, it is very\nslippery. At the very least, first person should rappel down in order to\nassist rest of the group with downclimb. Scout R6 anchor options before\ngoing down.</p>\n<p>R6: 140 ft, although shorter if you find an anchor close to the lip.\nYour only options maybe the the logs or tree trunks fallen into the\ncreek.</p>\n<p>Look L as you go down R6 to see a fault coming in from the L and\nstriking downstream to the R. Look down in the bottom of the canyon to\nsee slickensides (rock squished and abraded smooth from fault motion -\ntwo blocks of Earth moving along the plane of this fault). The\nslickensides range from white to black and have great exposure. See if\nyou can tell what the orientation of motion was for this fault!</p>\n<p>Series of short downclimbs until you get to next rappel.</p>\n<p>R7: 50 ft</p>\n<p>R8: 60 ft, although could be considerably longer depending on\ndownclimbing comfort and anchor availability</p>\n<p>R9: 240 ft - Actual drop is closer to 200ft. Anchor options are\nmostly on the right side. There are 3 trees in a row. Top one and the\nmiddle one are the best options. Total rope length of 500ft is the\nminimum to complete this rappel.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>After you get to the bottom of the last rap (the falls you can see\nfrom the bridge over Boetzke), walk downstream (there's a good changing\nspot under the bridge). There are a few options for getting back to the\nIron Horse, some likely much better than others. We took a nasty scree\nslope that comes in on the R just downstream of the bridge, which ended\nwith an overhanging root-climb, then bushwhack to the iron horse. That\nsucked, so consider going a bit further downstream, cutting up left, and\nbushwhacking up from there back to the iron horse. Please edit this if\nyou find a more preferable exit downstream.</p>\n<p>Once back to the bridge, head back along the Iron Horse to your\ncar.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<h2 id=\"media\">Media</h2>\n<p>==Trip reports and media==</p>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n",
