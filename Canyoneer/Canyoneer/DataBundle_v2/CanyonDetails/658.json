Then leave road to head down into unnamed drainage. Drainage has poison ivy. Is sometimes easier going out of drainage DCR.  About 1\/3 way down is Strahan Springs with water.  There will be one 15' dry fall that can be rappelled or bypassed DCR. Eventually, connect with Little LO Spring Canyon.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p><b>R1:<\/b> 45' into possible keeper pothole (or a steep, spicy downclimb at full water levels). During high water level, swim across and easy climb out. The pothole is deep, so lower levels will require pothole escape techniques. Possible to bypass rappelling in DCR instead about 70'.\n<\/p><p>Immediately after is another possible swimmer keeper pothole. Easier to escape as boulders at exit help to climb out on.\n<\/p><p><b>R2:<\/b> 40' into possible pool.
