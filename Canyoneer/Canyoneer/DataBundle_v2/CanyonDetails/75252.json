  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>Little Green Canyon is a smaller and prettier canyon compared to its\nrespectable counterpart, <a href=\"Trinity_Falls\"\ntitle=\"wikilink\">Trinity Falls</a>. While it does not have sculpted\nnarrows, its moss covered banks and cliff are well worth an adventurous\nperson's time. Running this canyon during the fall colors is recommended\nfor first timers however the water is very cold, so please consider\nbringing a 4/3. There are no swimmers, and 4 non-mandatory rappels,\nhowever down climbing around these rappels is risky and looks to be very\ndifficult.</p>\n<p>NOTE: This canyon has some webbing anchors, however they are aluminum\nrap rings. If you choose to do this canyon please bring a spool of\nwebbing and more durable rap rings. Or pull old webbing and ghost the\ncanyon.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>NOTICE: There are two ways to reach the technical section of the\ncanyon. The author of this has NOT done the recommended route. If you\nchoose to do the recommended route, please treat it like a first decent\nand bring the appropriate gear (webbing, rap rings, bolts)</p>\n<p>Approach to the canyon: Drive to Big Timber and follow the main\nboulder road. Upon your way up, make sure to check out natural bridge\nfalls and then continue up the main boulder. After passing natural\nbridge falls the road will turn from pavement to dirt, while most\nvehicles can drive on these roads, some run-off years can make the road\nmore difficult for low clearance vehicles (4 inches or less). The road\nwill eventually cross the boulder river, continuing 3.42 miles until you\nsee what looks like a really small and inconvenient pull off on the left\nside of the road. The parking here is mostly safe, it is both next to a\nchurch camp and farmers. However, I wouldn't leave a pile of cash on the\ndash of your car. The trail will be next to the pull off. Finding the\nstart of the trail is a little hard to find. Just walk a couple feet\ninto the large field above you and you will find that the trial is\npretty well maintained. Hike up the trail for .8 miles, depending on the\nyear, you will cross some small creeks until you reach Blakey creek. You\nwill know if you're in the right place due to a very old broken down\nbridge that crosses the creek. Please do not walk across this bridge, it\nmore than likely will not hold your weight. Just cross the creek via\nrocks. After crossing Blakey creek the trail will split. Take the right\ntrail that follows the creek bed up. At the throat of the canyon the\ntrail is a little washed out. Make sure to take a left when the trial\nsplits or you will end up in a boulder field at the bottom of rappel 4.\nOnce on the left trail you will now have two options.</p>\n<p>Recommended Route: (NOTICE: THE CREATORS OF THIS BETA HAVE NOT DONE\nTHIS ROUTE, BUT IT APPEARS TO BE MUCH FASTER, EASIER AND MORE FUN): Upon\ntaking the left on Blakey creek trail, climb up the trail around .37\nmiles or to coordinates 45.46118, -110.18561, here, take a water break\nand eat some food. Once at this point take a hikers right and you will\nfind a beautiful view of the canyon below and the boulder river. From\nhere it appears to be a couple of raps to the creek bottom. It appears\nto be a mixture of rappelling over cliffs and steep shale beds. While\nthis may sound less than ideal, it is vastly faster and more enjoyable\nthen the alternative route. If you choose to try this, please carry the\nright tools and make sure to edit your findings here.</p>\n<p>Other route: After taking the left up Blakey creek trail. Continue up\nthe trail .87 miles up the trail until reaching coordinates 45.46292,\n-110.18048. Once reaching this point there is a small ridge that\ndetaches to the trails right. Take the right and begin to descend into\nthe creek bed. This route is a couple hundred feet of steep shale\nwalking. Once in the creek bottom follow the creek until out. Keep in\nmind this option is very pretty, lots of beautiful moss. Make sure to\nsuit up and stay in the water path to avoid damaging the flora. There\nwill be a nasty section of deadfall between you and the technical\nsection, so make sure to cover wetsuits with tarnishable clothing.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>THERE ARE NO BOLTS, or usable slings as of spring 2023, bring your\nown, or ghost responsibly.</p>\n<p>Little Green Canyon begins with a small 15 foot rappel off a tree\nRDC. Follow the water flow down into rap 2 which can be walked around if\nchosen. Rap 2 is 15-20 feet. This will lead you into a small pretty\ngrotto, this area is beautiful during the fall. It typically is filled\nwith fallen leaves which contrast the moss well. Continue down to rap 3.\nRap 3 is a 70-120 foot slab rappel depending on where you rap. Keep in\nmind this rappel is entirely in the water flow so a fiddle stick is not\na good idea. There is also an option to go LDC and rappel out of the\nwater flow off a smaller cliff band. This is around 30 feet of mixed\nvertical and slab. Be careful pulling your rope here. This will lead you\ninto the final 4th rappel, which appears to be dramatic. Those wanting\nto rappel the water course will find a 110 foot rappel. Rappelling out\nof the water course is not recommended, but can be done LDC off trees\noverhanging the grotto below. You may also down climb this, but that\nshould be avoided at all costs. At the bottom of the rappel, you will\nfind yourself in a small grotto. Take pictures. You are done.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>To exit the canyon. Follow the trail LDC at the grotto and you will\nquickly reconnect with the trail to your car. Take the .8 miles trail\nout.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n",
