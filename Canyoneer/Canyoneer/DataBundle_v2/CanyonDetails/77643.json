The day before they had been in Bungleboori\nCk - north branch and experienced a massive 5m flash flood. Later on the\ntrip they climbed out of Bungleboori Ck and climbed into the lower part\nof the canyon from below. The same storm had left all the foam in the\ncanyon. It was named \"Froth and Bubble\" by Dave Noble and \"Bubble Bath\"\nby Brad Phillips.</p>\n"
