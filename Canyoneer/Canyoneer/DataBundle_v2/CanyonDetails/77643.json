The day before they had been in Bungleboori Ck - north branch and experienced a massive 5m flash flood. Later on the trip they climbed out of Bungleboori Ck and climbed into the lower part of the canyon from below. The same storm had left all the foam in the canyon. It was named \"Froth and Bubble\" by Dave Noble and \"Bubble Bath\" by Brad Phillips.\n<\/p>\n\n\n<\/div>","longitude":150.3481,"id":77643,"waterRating":null,"shuttleSeconds":null,"latitude":-33.3805,"vehicle":null,"rappelLongestMeters":null,"version":"069e47d3e9e743cd0762cb094e864200e8012de8ca34f77ae63a63e0799052ae","permit":"No","technicalRating":null,"timeRating":null,"riskRating":null,"geojson":null,"rappelCountMin":null}
