Day Parking is $10 or a $50 annual pass. With a National Park Pass discount it was $5 as they said they are concessionaires. Campsites are also available. The parking area has 2 pit toilets and a picnic table. Once the parking is full, they don't allow additional cars in or walk ins; there's no \"one in, one out\" policy.\n<\/p><p>Hike past the gate which will turn to a wide dirt fire road. The 2.5 mile hike will have views of the green tinted river below and surrounding mountain ranges. There will be a 20ft length small bridge about 20 minutes in to the left that has a nice view of a smaller side creek. Cross it and keep on the trail. Keep hiking for another 30 minutes to the large dirt parking lot with a forest sign that takes you down a developed trail to the water.  The very long 60ft length horse bridge is the marking point to leave the trail and into the water course. There are campsites at the sandy base of the bridge as well. Options for putting on the wetsuit: it could be at the bridge or scramble for another 15 minutes on the edges of the water to the first field long deep pool swimmer.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<ul><li>If done during the summer, the water flow is reduced below than 2cf and can be considered a \"B\".<\/li>\n<li>If done during  wet season, there may be higher water flow above 10cf that will create hydraulics and maybe considered a \"C\" swift water.
