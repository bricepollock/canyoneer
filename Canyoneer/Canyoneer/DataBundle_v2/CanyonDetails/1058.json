A small shoulder on the road can accommodate a few vehicles. Please make sure to park completely off the road. Carpooling from the park ride is also recommended to conserve the limited parking available. \n<\/p><p>After parking, find a well-worn path through the trees and into the river bed. The river is crossable during low flow but impossible to cross during heavy spring runoff. During times of high water, it's necessary to park further up the canyon and use one of the bridges along the Little Cottonwood Trail.\n<\/p><p>Once you have crossed the river, follow the Little Cottonwood Trail up about 300 feet. The trail to the base of the Great White Icicle will be on your right and requires some bushwhacking. Near the bottom of the Great White Icicle, continue to the right, bushwacking to a worn and primitive trail. Continue hiking and scrambling upwards through loose rocks and downed trees. Be careful with this approach to avoid rockfall hazards! There's a small stream on the left as you climb upwards. \n<\/p><p>Once you're near the top, cross over the small stream on the left, in front of a large rock slab, and continue to the left as you progress upwards. The worn trail under the rock slab should be obvious here. Nearing the top, you'll round an exposed corner (with incredible views of the canyon and valley below), downclimb several feet and cross a small creek just before the top of the Great White Icicle.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Rappel 1 (20 feet): The first rappel isn't mandatory and can be bypassed with downclimbing. A natural anchor consists of webbing slung around a broad tree trunk. \n<\/p><p>Rappel 2 (190 feet): Another natural anchor of webbing slung around a broad tree trunk. There are good ledges below to start your rappel. It's best to send the first person with a rope so they can rig the next rappel because rappel 3 starts on a (very) small ledge.\n<\/p><p>Rappel 3 (200  feet):  Bolted anchors on a (very) small ledge. With a 200-foot rope, you'll be 20  feet short of the flat ground. Getting off rappel on the slab and downclimbing the remaining distance safely is straightforward. In low water conditions, you can get off the rappel to the left of the waterfall, allowing more people to meet at the rappel station. But there's still limited space, so sequence carefully.\n<\/p><p>Rappel 4 (200 feet): Bolted anchors extended with red webbing. The fourth rappel starts on a large ledge and is an ideal spot to meet as a group, have a snack, and enjoy the spectacular views. Rappel extends above the cliff side, with sharp rocks, so set your rope carefully to avoid unnecessary damage. \n<\/p><p>Rappel 5 (60  feet): Another optional rappel. It can be downclimbed on the canyon left. But what's the fun of that? Bolted anchors make for easy rigging. Rappel is fun to slide in wet conditions.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Hike back to your vehicle and enjoy the rest of your day!\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Red_tape\">Red tape<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Beta_sites\">Beta sites<\/h2><\/div>\n<ul><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http:\/\/climb-utah.com\/WM\/icicle.htm\">Climb-Utah.com<\/a> &#160;: Great White Icicle<\/li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http:\/\/roadtripryan.com\/go\/t\/utah\/wasatch\/great-white-icicle\">RoadTripRyan.com<\/a> &#160;: Great White Icicle<\/li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http:\/\/hikearizona.com\/decoder.php?ZTN=16428\">HikeArizona.com<\/a> &#160;: The Great White Icicle<\/li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http:\/\/ropewiki.com\/User:Super_Amazing_Map?id=The_Great_White_Icicle_-_Wasatch_Mountains\">Super Amazing Map<\/a> &#160;: The Great White Icicle<\/li><\/ul>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media<\/h2><\/div>\n<ul><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http:\/\/candition.com\/canyons\/great-white-icicle-canyoneering\">Candition.com<\/a> &#160;: Great White Icicle (Canyoneering)<\/li><\/ul>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Background\">Background<\/h2><\/div>\n\n\n<\/div>","quality":3.2,"id":1058,"name":"Great White Icicle","vehicle":null,"longitude":-111.7408,"riskRating":"PG","timeRating":"II","version":"749295b676243d0cc37969602ef961f4d4ad5793541d4c1c13faed2b01e9ad4b","rappelCountMin":5,"waterRating":"C","rappelLongestMeters":67.06,"url":"https:\/\/ropewiki.com\/Great_White_Icicle","latitude":40.5675,"geojson":null,"months":["Jun","Jul","Aug"]}
