  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>Ogre Canyon is a water-based canyon with numerous waterfall rappels\nwhich offers those seeking adventure the perfect opportunity to step\noutside their comfort zone. A short approach hike of approximately 30\nminutes (100m elevation gain) will lead you through spectacular scenery\nto the rim of the canyon, which is tucked into a small silver of land\nbetween the first range of the Rockies and Brule Lake. Once you descend\ninside, you will make your way down approximately 8 rappels with the\nhighest descent being around 25 meters. The highlight of the day is the\ninfamous ‘Turbowash’. About half way down this impressive drop, a\nwaterfall feeds in from above, providing the ultimate rush.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<p><a\nhref=\"https://eclecticcats.wordpress.com/2018/05/16/a-spring-descent-of-ogre-canyon/\">A\nSpring Descent of Ogre Canyon</a></p>\n<p><a\nhref=\"https://globalnews.ca/news/4195914/teen-hikers-body-recovered-from-canyon-in-jasper-area/\">Teen\nHiker's body recovered from canyon</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n"
