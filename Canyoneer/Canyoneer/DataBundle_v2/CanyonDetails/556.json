class=\"mw-content-ltr mw-parser-output\" lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><p>While not overly technical, High Spur features a long, stunning set of narrows right before the technical portion. Suitable for beginner canyoneers with adequate guidance, the crux of\nthis canyon is likely the drive to the trailhead.\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Leave Utah Route 24 to the east onto Lower San Rafael Road. This dirt road continues southeast for several miles until you come to a T intersection with farming\/stock equipment on the right, continue on Lower San Rafael Road by turning left, passing over the shoulder between Little Flat Top and The Flat Tops. Follow this road for several miles until you come to another T intersection with an information board. Take the right fork labelled \"Hans Flat Ranger Station\" (Roost Road). Follow Roost road until you reach the ranger station and then turn left onto NP-777. (It's the road just to the right of the driveway up to the residence. It will pass a fenced off photovoltaic field). NP-777 is a fairly straightforward road with the exception of two slick-rock sections. A small sedan is unlikely to be able to navigate these sections, an unmodified rav\/4runner\/subi shouldn't have too much trouble with careful driving. Continue along this road until you come to a large intersection with a trailhead on the left. This is the start to High Spur Canyon.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>From the bottom of the technical portion of the canyon continue ~10 minutes walk down-canyon. On your right there will be a large side canyon\/breakdown that looks like an obvious escape. Head up the canyon navigating some sandy talus terrain until you reach the lip. There are two 4th class moves back-to-back. The first is a move to a corner on climbers right, then a few easy steps up into a traverse to climbers left. Experienced climbers\/canyoneers won't think twice about these moves but more novice canyoneers will appreciate a body belay from the top. \n<\/p><p>Once on the top of the first rim continue cross country (please stay on the trail as there is beautiful crypto abound!) following the canyoneers trail until you reach the bottom of the second rim. Scamper up the slick rock to the much darker sandstone above. Here find one of several trails that will take you back to BLM 1202. Follow BLM 1202 east for ~2 miles until you make it back to the parking lot where you started.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Red_tape\">Red tape<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>High Spur, while on BLM land is adjacent to the Glen Canyon National Recreation Area. While you should be fine to camp without a permit being in BLM land, you must pass through the park on the way to high spur. If you plan to camp either ensure you are outside the park and in BLM land or that you have obtained a backcountry permit from the Hans Flats Ranger station. At time of writing they were open 0800 - 1400.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Beta_sites\">Beta sites<\/h2><\/div>\n<ul><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http:\/\/roadtripryan.com\/go\/t\/utah\/robbers-roost\/highspur\">RoadTripRyan.com<\/a> &#160;: High Spur Canyon<\/li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http:\/\/climb-utah.com\/Roost\/highspur.htm\">Climb-Utah.com<\/a> &#160;: High Spur<\/li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http:\/\/canyoncollective.com\/betabase\/high-spur.35\">CanyonCollective.com<\/a> &#160;: High Spur<\/li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http:\/\/ropewiki.com\/User:Super_Amazing_Map?id=High_Spur_-_Robbers_Roost\">Super Amazing Map<\/a> &#160;: High Spur<\/li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http:\/\/canyoncollective.com\/betabase\/high-spur.638?kmlidxna\">CanyonCollective.com<\/a> &#160;: High Spur<\/li><\/ul>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media<\/h2><\/div>\n<p><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https:\/\/adamhaydock.blogspot.com\/2021\/05\/high-spur-canyon-3aiii-robbers-roost.html\">EVEN FURTHER-HIGH SPUR <\/a>\n<\/p>\n<ul><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http:\/\/candition.com\/canyons\/high-spur\">Candition.com<\/a> &#160;: High Spur<\/li><\/ul>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Background\">Background<\/h2><\/div>\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nParsed by mw‐api‐ext.codfw.main‐6779cc57fc‐m8c98\nCached time: 20240914192009\nCache expiry: 2592000\nReduced expiry: false\nComplications: [show‐toc]\nCPU time usage: 0.006 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.008 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 21\/1000000\nPost‐expand include size: 0\/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 0\/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 2\/100\nExpensive parser function count: 0\/500\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0\/20\nUnstrip post‐expand size: 0\/5000000 bytes\nNumber of Wikibase entities loaded: 0\/400\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%    0.000      1 -total\n-->\n<\/div>","waterRating":"A","id":556,"shuttleSeconds":null,"rappelLongestMeters":25.91,"vehicle":"High Clearance","version":"e23e5acae482bb4e446d3d7a4bb4af0cc94428ae89fec3cf648e68e64fc6ae22","longitude":-110.1518,"quality":4.3,"url":"https:\/\/ropewiki.com\/High_Spur_Canyon","name":"High Spur Canyon","riskRating":null}
