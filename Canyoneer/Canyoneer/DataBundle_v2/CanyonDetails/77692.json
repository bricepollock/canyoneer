You are aiming for a very small ramp\/chute through the cliffline at 56H 243242 6320541. On satellite imagery, it is the right-hand crack on a section of cliff that appears as a fragment partly separated from the main cliffs by cracks on the left and right.

Misses most of the scrub of option 1 but has some exposed scrambling: <\/b>\nParking and start: As per Option 1\nLook for a rough climber track heading up to the left a couple hundred meters before the Penrose Gully track. Follow this up through breaks in the lower cliff lines to the base of the upper cliff line near Kenobi Canyon (56H 242961 6320962) (short micro canyon worth a look up)\n50m north of Kenobi is a parallel slot (56H 242946 6321004) that will give access through the cliff line. This starts up an easy ramp but soon comes to a difficult boulder choke. Easiest way through the choke is to scramble into a alcove in the left wall just below the chock then up a 3m wall (grade 8 climb). First person up can drop a rope for others. Bit more scrambling and squeezing up the gully will get you to the outstanding views of Jedi Point.\n<\/p><p>From here there are several ways to access the Windows Gully upstream of the canyon including: a very scrubby walk down gully at (MR)431 211, the very narrow but pretty side canyon at (MR)432 211 or to avoid the majority of scrub in the upper creek simply head NNE and abseil in almost directly above the traditional first abseil.\n<link rel=\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\" href=\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1062633282\"> \n<\/p>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\">\n<div style=\"display:table;\">\n<span class=\"mw-default-size\" typeof=\"mw:Error mw:File\/Frameless\">\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p><b>Option 2: Mostly on-track walking using the Tigersnake Canyon route<\/b>\n<\/p><p>Parking: as for Option 1\n<\/p><p><br \/>\n<\/p>\n<ul><li>Start as for Option 1 but but remain on the Old Coach Track.<\/li>\n<li>Follow this track all the way to the Tigersnake Canyon carpark at 56H 242512 6317970, avoiding turns to Glow Worm Tunnel.<\/li>\n<li>Follow the Tigersnake entry route out along the ridge heading NE until you roughly in line with the gully at 56H 242507 6317965.
