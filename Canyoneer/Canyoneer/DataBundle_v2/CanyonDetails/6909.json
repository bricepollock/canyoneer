little north of the other canyons - a separate canyon mouth to ascend and gain the North side ridge. Could also be done from a south side ridge approach, as well\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>The entry point into the canyon is accessed by a dirt road that begins near the Furnace Creek campground. It requires 4-wheel drive and high clearance due to deep sand and ruts. This road should not be attempted if there is mud. Keep left at the fork and travel towards the mountain. The road curves right to approach the mountains at an angle closer to parallel before you reach the mouth of the canyon. There is a campground farther down this road so do not block the road with your vehicle. There is no shoulder so you will have to drive over the embankment.\n<\/p><p>The approach follows a gently winding wash for about a mile before turning southwest up a ridge, aiming toward the peak marked 1289 on the topo map. Near this high point, there is a flat area from which you can look east back towards Furnace Creek, or down into the canyon. After you've had your fill of the scenery, head back up another ridge to the southeast. The rock here is volcanic in origin and very easy for shoes to grip. The sharpness also makes it a good idea to use gloves if you use your hands to balance. Rockhounds may be interested in the numerous \"volcanic bombs\" on the surface and embedded in the rock. These were formed when magma was ejected into the atmosphere and cooled before it reached the ground.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>There are only three rappels in the canyon, preceded and followed by boulder-strewn descents. The three rappels are in rapid succession.\n<\/p><p><b>Rappel 1:<\/b> A sling around a rock, under a large boulder.\n<\/p><p><b>Rappel 2:<\/b> Cairn anchor\n<\/p><p><b>Rappel 3:<\/b> Chockstone wedged in a narrow groove in the rock near the lip of the cliff. (One member of our party was able to down climb this.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>After avout 1.3 miles, the canyon widens out into a gravel and packed dirt wash.
