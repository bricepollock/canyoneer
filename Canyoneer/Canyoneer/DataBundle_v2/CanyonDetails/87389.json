If you're looking for some refreshing fun from the summer heat, this is primo.  Depending on the exit, you can b-line it back to the starting location, or plan for an easy hike out with a shuttle.\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>From the Monument Trailhead, hike 3.0 miles on the Nebo Bench Trail until you come to the drainage in Hell Hole Basin. Upon reaching the drainage, if there is snow (June) the easiest approach into the gully is down the ridge (in the trees) just past the ravine.  In dry conditions you will be able to enter the drainage from the trail without a problem.  After some zig-zagging down and across the drainage, there is some scree bypass on the right that will lead you down to your first rappel.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Once you're at the first rappel, the technical sequence is as follows:\n<\/p><p><br \/>\n<b>r1: 100', webbing DCL from a tree\/roots<\/b>\n<\/p><p><b>r2: 60', fiddle from tree LDC<\/b>\n<\/p><p><b>r3: 50', webbing from log in waterflow (rap is 50', 100' needed)<\/b>\n<\/p><p><b>r4: 100', fiddle from dead logs\/tree DCL<\/b>\n<\/p><p><b>r5: 40', webbing DCL from roots<\/b>\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Hike down the rest of the drainage until it meets up with the main canyon.  LEFT will take you directly back to your car (unexplored) with about 1600' gain, but 1\/2 the distance of the shuttle hike out.\n<\/p><p>Turning right will take you down to a few trail junctions, the exit used for Middle Basin, and the Right Fork Salt Creek Trail.
