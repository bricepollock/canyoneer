Just past the right hand turn to Vogel Flats, on the south side of the road, there are two small gravel parking lots at 34.2875 -118.2250.  This is the trail-head for the Condor Peak Trail.  The trail begins across the street on the north side of Big TJ Road.  Look for several 4' tall rusted metal pylons, used to stop debris flow, walk through or around them and the trail starts immediately.

At 34.3131 -118.1973 you will leave the trail and bushwhack a short distance to the N\/NE up to the ridgeline saddle.  There are several tiny and clear drainages in the area which offer a fairly painless route.  Once up to the saddle, continue to the east along the ridgeline until you reach the top at 4900'.  An incredible 360 degree view of the entire Big Tujunga back country rewards you for the 3 hours of effort.  Continue down the other side of the summit until you get to the \"point of no (easy) return\", at about 34.3107 -118.1893.  From this point continue down-hill along the prominent and obvious ridgeline to the south.  Follow this ridgeline until it turns abruptly to the east at 34.3055 -118.1880.  This point is the drop-in for the unexplored right fork (looking down canyon).  Continue east along the ridgeline until it ends at 34.305715 -118.185624.
