{"url":"https:\/\/ropewiki.com\/Canyon_Creek_(Oregon)","description":"<div class=\"mw-content-ltr mw-parser-output\" lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><p><b><font color=\"red\">Current Status: Closed. This creek was overrun by the Beachie\/Santiam Fire in Sept 2020 and has been closed.  Please check on local closures before planning a trip to this area. When the area eventually reopens, use extreme caution when descending the creek. Between landslides, fallen trees, and loose rocks, this area may be unstable and dangerous for years to come. The canyon may have changed dramatically. Do not rely on the beta below being accurate.<\/font><\/b>\n<\/p><p>Update May 2024: The Canyon Creek Recreation Site is still closed.\n<\/p><p>Another nice creek in the vicinity of Elkhorn, OR.   Canyon Creek would be a first-rate creek if:  1) a shuttle was possible up to the top, and 2) the good bits were closer together.  As it stands, plan to spend at least an hour bushwhacking and following logging roads up to the top.  There are also some long creek walks between the rappels.  That said, when Canyon Creek is good, it's really good.  Some of the narrows likely would be quite dangerous in high water... there is no escape.  Canyon Creek Falls is also a joy to rappel.  While it has a somewhat high pay-to-play, there are much worse ways to spend a fine summer's day.\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Area roads are gated by the timber company who owns the land, so a hike up to the top from the Canyon Creek Recreation Area is required.   The recreation area is day-use only.  This area is hugely popular with families in the summer, so plan to arrive early to get good parking.\n<\/p><p>Be prepared for some reasonably serious bushwhacking on the approach.  Canyon Creek has an entry fee.  Bring a map and GPS to stay on track.  Figure out where you need to go ahead of time.\n<\/p>\n<ul><li>From the parking area, head down to the river.  Cross the LIttle North Santiam and make your way downstream a short distance to find the mouth of Canyon Creek.  Cross the creek and make your way up into the forest on the far side.<\/li>\n<li>Make your way upwards steeply through the forest for ~200ft following game trails.  You will eventually reach an old overgrown road.<\/li>\n<li>Follow the overgrown road (some bits more overgrown than others), left \/ southwest for about 0.1mi.  Push out through some briars onto a maintained logging road.<\/li>\n<li>Follow the logging road north about 0.5mi to a T-jct.<\/li>\n<li>Bear left at the junction for about 0.15mi.  Wherever is easiest, bushwhack due west, pushing through a relatively short band of forest and emerge into a larger clearcut.<\/li>\n<li>Head northwest and uphill across the clearcut (relatively easy) for 250ft elevation gain until you intersect a second maintained logging road.<\/li>\n<li>Follow the second logging road north for about 0.6mi to a Y-jct.<\/li>\n<li>Bear right and continue on the road for another 0.5mi to a second junction.<\/li>\n<li>Bear right again on a spur road.  Go approximately 0.1mi and then bushwhack down steep, somewhat overgrown slopes to the north to enter Canyon Creek.<\/li><\/ul>\n<p>Entire approach takes about an hour for seasoned adventure thrashers.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Drainage is a bit overgrown and unimpressive at first.  Head downstream to the top of the first falls.  The first three rappels come in quick succession.\n<\/p>\n<ul><li>R1:  30ft.<\/li>\n<li>R2:  50ft<\/li>\n<li>8ft downclimb.<\/li>\n<li>R3:  20ft.<\/li><\/ul>\n<p>Head downstream 5min to reach the main line of Canyon Creek.  A short slide (3ft) leads into a deep pothole.  The canyon swings right and narrows up.  There is no escape until after R6.\n<\/p><p>First Narrows:\n<\/p>\n<ul><li>R4:  20ft followed by a couple of short downclimbs.<\/li>\n<li>R5:  30ft in two tiers.  Interesting hanging pothole between the tiers;  need to \"sea lion\" your way out to continue the rappel.<\/li>\n<li>R6:  35ft.<\/li><\/ul>\n<p>Walk ahead for awhile through some nice bedrock.\n<\/p><p>Second Narrows:\n<\/p>\n<ul><li>R7:  8ft.  Rappel or downclimb.<\/li><\/ul>\n<p>Walk ahead through some nice bedrock steps and pools.  One short slide.  Continue downstream perhaps 0.5mi.\n<\/p><p>Third Narrows:\n<\/p>\n<ul><li>R8:  Canyon Creek Falls.  80ft high, but 105ft of rope required.  Creek narrows up into a deep slot with multiple short drops (more horizontal than vertical) before a plunge of 60ft into a deep pool below.<\/li><\/ul>\n<p>Another 0.3mi of creek walking.  Just when you think you're done, the creek slots up again one last time.\n<\/p><p>Fourth Narrows:\n<\/p>\n<ul><li>R9:  20ft, followed by 3ft slide into a second pool.  Beware rope eating cracks at the top of the rappel.<\/li><\/ul>\n<p>Continue 5-10min to the North Fork Santiam River.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Where Canyon Creek dumps into the North Fork Santiam, cross the river and walk back up the hill to your car.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Red_tape\">Red tape<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Need a parking pass to park in the picnic area at the Canyon Creek Recreation Area.
