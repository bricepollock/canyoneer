Gulch evokes feelings of quarantine. The first known descent was on 2020-10-25 by Alex Reeves, Brit Wylie, and Galilea von Ruden.\n<\/p><p>This canyon is designated R because of the required natural anchors (e.g. fiddlestick).\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Park at the same trailhead as for Fall Creek or GFOTF: 34.29725,-118.16994.

Expect downclimbs increasing in difficulty and length; some party members may require a belay or rappel.\n<\/p><p>Eventually the canyon cliffs out at its one mandatory rappel. There are a couple natural anchor options at the top, but you will need expertise in setting and evaluating natural anchors to proceed.\n<\/p><p>After this, continue down much as before to the bottom of Big Tujunga. Alternatively, shortly after the mandatory rappel you can angle up and to the right to gain a large flat area with a number of good rappel lines on its face (approx 150 feet).
