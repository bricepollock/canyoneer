Toad Pool offers three nice rappels, a sweet slot to practice stemming through, and a fun scramble on the approach to the top of the canyon.\n<\/p><p>There may be water at the bottom of the second and third rappels. The pools are typically ankle to shin deep, hence the name \"Toad Pool\", but could be up to waist deep depending on the recent weather. The pools are at the end of the canyon and about 10 minutes from the parking lot, so getting wet isn't too bad if need be.\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Drive west on W Charleston Boulevard until you reach the entrance to Red Rock Canyon National Conversation Area on your right. Turn onto the Scenic Drive. The first pullout on the right is the trailhead.\n<\/p><p>Follow the well worn path down the ridge, then turn slightly right and descend the slickrock to the canyon bottom.  Turn left (up canyon) and then scramble up the rocks up a semi-canyon that is the easiest spot to climb up. Once the rock you are scrambling is no longer white but now red, work your way Right to the east about 100 yards. As you look down, you will see the canyon with what looks like big cracks in the rock mountain and a short jount west at the bottom. This is the canyon and the cracks are the narrows.\n<\/p><p>Variation: Instead of turning slightly right at the end of the ridge at the beginning of the approach, turn left and descend to the optional drop leading to the canyon bottom.  This drop will likely present anchor challenges as no webbing should be left behind.  Once in the canyon bottom, go slightly down canyon then turn around and begin the scramble described above.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading3\"><h3 id=\"Alternate_approach\">Alternate approach<\/h3><\/div>\n<p>For a shorter approach with more scrambling, turn right at the canyon bottom and begin scrambling steadily upwards as you travel east-southeast. After crossing Toad Pool Canyon, turn left up the next gully until you reach a saddle just short of the ridgeline. This approach allows you to scout the canyon before starting it and also has slightly less elevation gain in exchange for skipping the excellent view provided by reaching the top of the ridgeline.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>As this is a well-traveled area, please try to keep this canyon somewhat hidden from the large number of visitors by not leaving webbing on any drop. Each rappel can be ghosted using a <a href=\"\/w\/index.php?title=FiddleStick&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"FiddleStick (page does not exist)\">FiddleStick<\/a> or <a href=\"\/w\/index.php?title=CEM_Knot&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"CEM Knot (page does not exist)\">CEM Knot<\/a>. If no other options are available, one person can usually exit the canyon and scramble back up and around the drop to retrieve the anchor.\n<\/p><p><b>R1<\/b>: 40' from a chockstone in the slot RDC.  \n<\/p><p>Continue downcanyon staying in the drainage. Alternate exits abound. Continue through a patch of bushes and a narrow slot will follow shortly after. At the end of the narrow slot is a downclimb that may need to be belayed for some group members. Turn right to follow another deep slot that opens into a larger area. \n<\/p><p><b>R2<\/b>: 35' off a small chockstone or using a meat anchor who can then chimney down the drop. The pool at the bottom can be anything from bone dry to waist deep and 50' long, depending on the season. A guided rappel can be set up for everyone in the group except the first and last people (who could be the same person - the slot can be upclimbed with a small amount of rope assistance).\n<\/p><p><b>R3<\/b>: 45' from single bolt atop a large rock formation RDC or downclimb the drop in the middle of the canyon. The geometry is also correct for a backpack anchor.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>The last rappel puts you in the bottom if the main drainage where you can see the parking lot up the hill. Follow well-traveled use trails to the right toward the ridge you followed down on the approach.\n<\/p><p>As the Red Rocks Scenic Drive is one-way, you cannot return the way you came. Take a right out of the parking lot and continue down the Scenic Drive for 11 miles (approx. 24 minutes) until you reach the park exit.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Red_tape\">Red tape<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>An annual parks pass or fee of $15 per vehicle is required to enter Red Rocks. From November through May, Red Rocks requires a timed entry reservation to enter the scenic loop between 8:00am and 5:00pm. An entry reservation costs $2 per vehicle and can only be booked online at <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https:\/\/www.recreation.gov\/timed-entry\/10075177\">recreation.gov<\/a>. \n<\/p><p>New bolts are not allowed in Red Rocks and this route does not require them.  This is a well-traveled area and transient anchors (ghosting) are strongly recommended.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Beta_sites\">Beta sites<\/h2><\/div>\n<div
