  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>Cedar Grove is a drainage near La Porte. Its main rappel can be seen\nfrom the approach road. Run in the right season, it can be a short and\nsweet introduction to class C flow. Aside from this waterfall (and\nnuisance rappels dropping into it), Cedar Grove is a pleasant\ndownclimbing creek walk.</p>\n<p>Reference rappel is at the fork, there’s also a road that crosses the\nmain Cedar Grove drainage, but you can get a sense of the area’s\nconditions with the tunnel falls where you park as well (See <a\nhref=\"Sears_Ravine\" title=\"wikilink\">Sears Ravine</a>).</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>From the town of La Porte take St Louis Rd (forest road 21N13X) until\nthe bridge, where it becomes Port Wine Rd. Cross the bridge and park on\nthe west side. Continue up the road on foot to the fork. Be careful, the\nroad is popular with OHVers who may not be expecting foot traffic. The\nentry drainage crosses under the road at the fork.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>Rappel heights are approximate.</p>\n<p>R1 is reached shortly after leaving the road, 40ft from the brushy\nroot LDC, or bypassed RDC by descending the scree slope instead of the\ndrainage. Optional R2 (15ft) is about midway down the entry drainage,\nalso bypassable LDC.</p>\n<p>Once in the main drainage, after a short narrows section, you’ll\nreach R3, a two-stage waterfall 190 ft from a tree high RDC (we used 2x\n200’ of rope including pull strand). After the first stage (25ft into a\nshallow, rocky pool) stay on rope for the second (30ft). Pull from the\nledge LDC above the bottom pool. These stages deserve to be bolted\nseparately.</p>\n<p>The rest of the canyon is mostly a creek walk, with one more drop\nending in a deep pool. When you reach it, look for the corkscrew-shaped\ncrevice on the LDC side, which can be carefully downclimbed.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>After the canyon empties into Slate Creek, continue upstream to the\nbridge and your car.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<p><a\nhref=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1B6xdi4T5T0txmjiK83dc7awpmz_b_M9a6gqx95YbJ1c/edit?usp=sharing\">May\n2020 trip report and photos</a> by Quinn Shemet</p>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n<p>First descended in May 2020 by Carly, Quinn, Niles, and Evan</p>\n",
