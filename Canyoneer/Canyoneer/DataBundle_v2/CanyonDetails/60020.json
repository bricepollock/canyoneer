Its main rappel can be seen from the approach road. Run in the right season, it can be a short and sweet introduction to class C flow. Aside from this waterfall (and nuisance rappels dropping into it), Cedar Grove is a pleasant downclimbing creek walk.\n<\/p><p>Reference rappel is at the fork, there’s also a road that crosses the main Cedar Grove drainage, but you can get a sense of the area’s conditions with the tunnel falls where you park as well (See <a href=\"\/w\/index.php?title=Sears_Ravine&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Sears Ravine (page does not exist)\">Sears Ravine<\/a>).\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>From the town of La Porte take St Louis Rd (forest road 21N13X) until the bridge, where it becomes Port Wine Rd. Cross the bridge and park on the west side. Continue up the road on foot to the fork. Be careful, the road is popular with OHVers who may not be expecting foot traffic. The entry drainage crosses under the road at the fork.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Rappel heights are approximate.\n<\/p><p>R1 is reached shortly after leaving the road, 40ft from the brushy root LDC, or bypassed RDC by descending the scree slope instead of the drainage. Optional R2 (15ft) is about midway down the entry drainage, also bypassable LDC.\n<\/p><p>Once in the main drainage, after a short narrows section, you’ll reach R3, a two-stage waterfall 190 ft from a tree high RDC (we used 2x 200’ of rope including pull strand). After the first stage (25ft into a shallow, rocky pool) stay on rope for the second (30ft). Pull from the ledge LDC above the bottom pool. These stages deserve to be bolted separately.\n<\/p><p>The rest of the canyon is mostly a creek walk, with one more drop ending in a deep pool. When you reach it, look for the corkscrew-shaped crevice on the LDC side, which can be carefully downclimbed.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>After the canyon empties into Slate Creek, continue upstream to the bridge and your car.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Red_tape\">Red tape<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Beta_sites\">Beta sites<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media<\/h2><\/div>\n<p><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/document\/d\/1B6xdi4T5T0txmjiK83dc7awpmz_b_M9a6gqx95YbJ1c\/edit?usp=sharing\">May 2020 trip report and photos<\/a> by Quinn Shemet\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Background\">Background<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>First descended in May 2020 by Carly, Quinn, Niles, and Evan\n<\/p>\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nParsed by mw‐api‐ext.codfw.main‐6779cc57fc‐mmmw8\nCached time: 20240914192017\nCache expiry: 2592000\nReduced expiry: false\nComplications: [show‐toc]\nCPU time usage: 0.009 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.011 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 22\/1000000\nPost‐expand include size: 0\/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 0\/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 2\/100\nExpensive parser function count: 0\/500\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0\/20\nUnstrip post‐expand size: 0\/5000000 bytes\nNumber of Wikibase entities loaded: 0\/400\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%    0.000      1 -total\n-->\n<\/div>","rappelCountMin":1,"rappelCountMax":3,"vehicle":"Passenger","name":"Cedar Grove"}
