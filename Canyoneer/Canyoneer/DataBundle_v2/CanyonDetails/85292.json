{"description":"<div class=\"mw-content-ltr mw-parser-output\" lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><p>This page is for the lower section of Burrow Wash that the National Park lists as a hike.  This hike is a class 2A, bottom-up canyoneering route that is family friendly.

Hike westward up the dry wash--Burro Wash. The wash will start out going northwest and then will bend slightly south west as the canyon walls start rising.  At the main junction, keep Right Up Canyon and shortly afterwards the class 2 portion will begin.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Hike up canyon through a series of narrows and open areas.  There are several chances to play around stemming and chimneying as you go.  The class 2 section will end in an alcove with an impassable dryfall.  This dryfall is the final rappel (R4) of the Burro Wash top-down, class 3 technical route.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>To exit, turn around and
