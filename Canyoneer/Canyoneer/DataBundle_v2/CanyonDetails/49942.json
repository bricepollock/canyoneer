  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>Irene Creek is a large, north-facing drainage that joins the Cascade\nRiver just across from Lookout Mountain. From the confluence, the first\nfalls is a showy curtain spilling from a undercut slot. Peer behind this\ncurtain to find Cascadian Dream, a scenic bedrock narrows full of\nsmaller drops and pools. This is topped by a second falls dropping into\na deep shrine-like alcove.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>The crux on the approach is getting across the Cascade River. Getting\nacross the Cascade River is NOT easy most of the year. It drains a large\nreach of the cascade crest including several large glaciers. Just\nupstream of the confluence is a class V rapid, affectionately named\n'Monster'. The bank on the north side is also steep with very few\nbeaches or eddies. Nevertheless, stream flow can subside by late season\non a dry year for a reasonable crossing. Check <a\nhref=\"https://www.americanwhitewater.org/content/River/view/river-detail/2077/flow\">an\nonline CFS flow graph</a> before attempting. Crossing is an easy swim at\n~200cfs. Above 450cfs, crossing may require a boat and some whitewater\nexperience.</p>\n<p><strong>'Cascadian Dream' Approach</strong> <em>(Requires river\ncrossing)</em></p>\n<p>Park on the Cascade River Rd, at a turnout near an old logging road\nbefore the culvert over a small stream, roughly above 'Monster'. Head\nWest down the road 30 yards, and drop into the trees. There seems to a\nvariety of routes to the river, but orange flagging (visible from road)\nmarks a not too horrible path. Leaving a 30 ft hand line rope in place\ncan make the last little bit easier going up and down. Once at the\nriver, walk upstream to below Monster. The final falls of Irene should\nbe visible direct across the river. Swim across the river in the calmer\nsection to Irene Creek.</p>\n<p>At the west corner of the creek &amp; river, pick up further orange\nflagging into the trees, following it up the steep hillside. Despite the\nverticality of the route, the open trees and faint trail makes it fairly\neasy going.</p>\n<p>This route gives access to both the lower and top entrances. You can\ntake a look at the creek flow at the lower entrance. Continuing up the\nwest slope, until it opens up to an old clear cut. For the nicest drop\nto R1, follow the edge of the clear cut uphill another 100 yards and\nthen turn towards the creek (orange flagging continues). The R1 tree is\nflagged, and has webbing for the rappel down to just above the R1 upper\nlarge falls.</p>\n<p><strong>'Cascadian Nightmare' Approach</strong> (Avoids river\ncrossing)''</p>\n<p>Use road FS1550 and hike cross country to the east side of the\ncanyon. With good route-finding, expect a full day effort and be\nprepared to encounter some brush. While there are large swaths of open\nmature timber on gentle slopes, there is a fair mix of steep sidehilling\nthough boulder fields, devils club, vine maple, and other assorted\nshrubbery. Stay above the clearcut, though it is impossible to avoid if\nyou drop down to the Cascade River level. It is possible to scramble\ndirectly into the middle of the narrows from the east side, connecting\nto Cascadian Dream but it is somewhat steep and precarious. Be wary of\nyellow-jackets on hot days.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p><em>(When reading old trip reports, note that R1 used to be called\nR0, and R7 wasn't needed. This meant R6 referred to the final\nrap).</em></p>\n<p><strong>R1</strong> (entrance rappel into the creek): 70' dry rappel\nfrom webbing off flagged tree on the edge of the canyon. The slope the\nR1 tree is on is steep, so we recommend just putting harnesses on for R1\nand waiting to fully suit up at the bottom. There is plenty of dry land\nfor a suit-up area above R2.</p>\n<p><strong>R2</strong> (Upper Falls): 140â€™ from unlinked bolts DCR into\na pool. Fall line from this anchor takes you through the heavy heart of\nthe flow the entire way. An incredible rappel.</p>\n<p>Scramble below the 'weir', an impressive logjam, partway down the\nstart of a narrow sluice to a ledge DCR.</p>\n<p><strong>R3</strong>: 20' from a knot chock DCR</p>\n<p><strong>J1</strong>: 8' jump off chockstone or small ledge DCL. There\nis a boulder roughly 5' underwater - check the bottom and/or use shallow\njump technique.</p>\n<p><strong>R4</strong>: 50' from webbing off tree DCL</p>\n<p><strong>R5</strong>: 40' from webbing off tree on shelf DCL, or\n<strong>J2</strong>: 35' jump into a deep pool from shelf DCL.</p>\n<p><strong>J3</strong>: 8' jump from a chockstone over 'twin falls'.</p>\n<p>This puts us back to the lower entrance (see reference photo), and\nearly exit option DCL.</p>\n<p><strong>R6</strong>: 100' two-stage rappel from tree DCR with a long\npiece of webbing extended around the edge. Last person should make sure\nthat the rapide extends past the boulders/brush at the top of the first\nfalls for a clean pull. A courtesy anchor is recommended. The second\nstage is not a slide, as it looks from above.</p>\n<p><strong>R7</strong>: 30' from boulder pinch DCR to approach the R8\nanchor (can be rigged as retrievable hand line).</p>\n<p><strong>R8</strong> (Irene Creek Falls): 95' from unlinked bolts on\nthe backside of huge chockstone</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>The final rappel deposits you a few hundred feet from where you\ncrossed the Cascade River. Return via approach chosen.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<p>None. The creek is on state forest land adjacent to national forest\nland.</p>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<p><a\nhref=\"https://www.waterfallsnorthwest.com/waterfall/Irene-Creek-Falls-3361\">Northwest\nWaterfall Survey - Irene Creek Falls</a></p>\n<p><a\nhref=\"https://www.americanwhitewater.org/content/River/view/river-detail/2077/flow\">American\nWhitewater - Cascade River Info and Flow Gauge</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<p>Photos from Sep 2020: <a\nhref=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/pnwcanyoning/permalink/10158706090360789\">https://www.facebook.com/groups/pnwcanyoning/permalink/10158706090360789</a></p>\n<p>More photos from Sep 2020: <a\nhref=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/pnwcanyoning/permalink/10158797792945789\">https://www.facebook.com/groups/pnwcanyoning/permalink/10158797792945789</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n<p>First descent by Yana Radenska, Kevin Steffa, Josh Warren, Cassandra\nSipe in 2017.</p>\n<p>Special thanks to Didzis Beitlers for route ground truthing.</p>\n",
