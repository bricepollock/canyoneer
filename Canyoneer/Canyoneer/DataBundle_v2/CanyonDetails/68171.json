{"waterRating":"B","id":68171,"longitude":-111.1742,"description":"<div class=\"mw-content-ltr mw-parser-output\" lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><p>A Beautiful route that combine 2 short Canyons with an astonishing landscape. Depending on your skills you can complete it as 3(A\/B)III by using standard anchors and the bypasses described in the beta, or 4(A\/B)IV if you use sandtrap\/wateranchor and ghosting technics to complete the canyon without taking the bypasses.\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Approach for the first canyon \nIt starts by the parking lot at Pleasant Creek close by Capitol Reef  Field  Station. You will be hiking parallel to Pleasant creek for about 20 min. later you will be turning to the RDC, and you will be starting to scramble up to the drainage of the first canyon for about 1.5-2 hours with and average pace.\n<\/p><p>Note: For more information about the Approach please visit <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external free\" href=\"http:\/\/www.bluugnome.com\">http:\/\/www.bluugnome.com<\/a>\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>One you are on top of the first canyon (38.17549 -111.17427), find your way down through the boulders  to the base of the canyon. You will be bushwhacking before you arrive to the first downclimb section, and later on you will be arriving to the first rappel station (38.17437 -111.17315). This first part can be completed in less that one hour.\n<\/p><p>After the first technical section is completed, you need to start hiking up LDC for about 30 min until you find the deep crack that is the reference point for the anchor of the first rappel for the second canyon.\n<\/p><p>The first rappel of the second canyon is located about 150ft  at the right side of the deep crack. Originally the 140ft rappel is done from a set of bushes. However, the bushes looks dead. The new anchor is located about 30ft close to the old anchor.\n<\/p><p>We place a 25ft courtesy rigging from the big tree located at the beginning of the drainage. For that reason the rappel will be increased up to 190ft from the tree (or 165ft from the courtesy rigging while it is full extended to the V shape of the crack). \n<\/p><p>The deadman anchor of the 2nd rappel of the second canyon is gone. The new anchor is a chockstone with a webbing located at the bottom of the downclimb section. The small pothole doesn't have enough water to use the water anchor.\n<\/p><p>We did a couple of sections that the beta gives the option of bypass. They are fun. It is a nice place to use  Sandtrap\/wateranchor and ghosting technics.\n<\/p><p>The last section that the beta suggest to bypass has nice drops with potholes that have water. It will be adding a couple of hours to the estimate time from the beta.\n<\/p><p>Note: For more details about the descend please visit <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external free\" href=\"http:\/\/www.bluugnome.com\">http:\/\/www.bluugnome.com<\/a>\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>The exit will be taking a couple hours.\n<\/p><p>Note: For an extended description about the exit please visit <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external free\" href=\"http:\/\/www.bluugnome.com\">http:\/\/www.bluugnome.com<\/a>\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Red_Tape\">Red Tape<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading3\"><h3 id=\"Permits\">Permits<\/h3><\/div>\n<p>A permit is required for any and all canyoneering within the boundaries of Capitol Reef National Park.  Permits have a group-size limit that varies depending on the canyon or route.  A separate permit is required for each canyoneering route.  Currently, there is no quota limit nor permit cost, though that is likely to change at some point in the future.  Permits can be obtained onsite through a self-serve kiosk located just outside of the visitor center or by sending and email to care_permits@nps.gov using the following format:\n<\/p><p><b>Subject: <\/b> Name of canyoneering route and date you will be canyoneering. \n<\/p><p><b>Email Body: <\/b>\nDate of visit (single day only): \nCanyoneering route (single route only): \nNumber of people: \nVehicle location: \nNumber of motorized vehicles: \nVehicle description(s): \n<\/p><p>If you plan to camp overnight as part of a canyoneering trip, you are required to obtain a free backcountry permit, available at the visitor center. \n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading3\"><h3 id=\"Additional_Access_Information:\">Additional Access Information:<\/h3><\/div>\n<ul><li>CRNP canyoneering permit information webpage: <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external free\" href=\"https:\/\/www.nps.gov\/care\/planyourvisit\/canyoneering.htm\">https:\/\/www.nps.gov\/care\/planyourvisit\/canyoneering.htm<\/a><\/li>\n<li>Other: <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external free\" href=\"http:\/\/www.americancanyoneers.org\/access-capitol-reef\/\">http:\/\/www.americancanyoneers.org\/access-capitol-reef\/<\/a><\/li><\/ul>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading3\"><h3 id=\"Group-Size_Limit:\">Group-Size Limit:<\/h3><\/div>\n<p>Canyoneering groups are limited to a maximum of 8 people for this Canyon.\n<\/p><p>Groups larger than 8 or 12 sharing the same affiliation (school, church, club, scout group, family, friends, etc., or combination thereof) may divide into groups smaller than 8 or 12, provided they do not occupy the same canyon, drainage, general area or the same route on the same day.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading3\"><h3 id=\"Park_Entrance_Fee:\">Park Entrance Fee:<\/h3><\/div>\n<p>The Scenic drive is the only area of Capitol Reef where an entry fee or park pass is required.
