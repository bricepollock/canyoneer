{"id":49963,"url":"https:\/\/ropewiki.com\/Lake_Creek_(Baker_River)","description":"<div class=\"mw-content-ltr mw-parser-output\" lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><p>Lake Creek is located within Mount Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest in Whatcom County, Washington. It is a tributary of the Baker River and is sourced by Shuksan Lake. The waters of Lake Creek have carved an impressive and winding canyon that has snaked its way through black, white, and red speckled bedrock. The approach is quite long and strenuous, and typically takes 3-4 hours, with the majority of the elevation gain off trail. Some groups have had difficulty navigating the approach. Your effort is rewarded however with 17  back-to-back rappels in a unique and winding creek tucked away into the hills of the Baker River.\n<\/p><p>An early start is recommended for this canyon, as well as an efficient team with strong rappelling and rigging skills.\n<\/p><p>Lake Creek in the Mount Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest should not be confused with the <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http:\/\/ropewiki.com\/Lake_Creek\">Lake Creek in Wenatchee National Forest<\/a>.\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading3\"><h3 id=\"Drive\">Drive<\/h3><\/div>\n<p>From Washington Highway 20 East, turn left (north) on Baker Lake Rd and travel 26 miles until the road ends at the Baker River Trail parking area. You will need a Northwest Forest pass to park at the trail head or alternatively pay $5 for a day-use pass.\n<\/p><p><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/maps\/dir\/\/Baker\">River Trail, NF-11, Concrete, WA 98237 Google Maps directions to parking area<\/a>\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading3\"><h3 id=\"Hike\">Hike<\/h3><\/div>\n<p>Hike along the relatively flat Baker River Trail for 2 miles. Just before you reach the bridge that crosses Lake Creek, veer off-trail into the woods, following the path of least resistance while paralleling the creek. Once you reach the hillside, look for traces of old flagging tape on trees. This flagging marks an old single track trail. The uphill portion of the approach is very steep and will take several hours. If you lose the flagging prior to 2,400', you may be too far off track. Continue climbing until 2400' and begin traversing across the hillside towards the creek. You will cross several small gullies before the final obstacle, a 10-15 minute thick bushwhack through vine maples before reaching the drop-in. If you need to rappel to get into the canyon, you are likely too low and need to continue uphill to the drop-in.\n<\/p><p>Enter the canyon around ~2200'.
