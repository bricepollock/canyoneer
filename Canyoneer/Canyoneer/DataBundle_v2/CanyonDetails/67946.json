  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>Alpine canyon with many 20-30m rappels, most of them not\nvertical.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>Use the Gondola to Kilcherberg, from there it's still almost 900m\nuphill. Just before reaching the Seewli, follow down the first water\nstream which seeps down into the rocks.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>The first rappel is completely dry, the water reappears from the left\non the second one. From then on, the canyon continuously has 20-30m slab\nwaterfalls, which unfortunately are not well polished. The best part is\na 60m waterfall which leads into a big open hall. While you have\npossibilities to get out of the water almost all the time, leaving the\ncanyon is impossible until the very end.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>Reach the hiking path, from which one you'll get back to\nKilcherberge. Alternatively, abseil down to the valley in the\nneighbouring canyon Selderbach, which most certainly will be dry at that\nperiod of the year.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n",
