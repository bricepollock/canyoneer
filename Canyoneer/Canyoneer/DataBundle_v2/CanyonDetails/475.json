  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>If you're looking for a challenging technical descent, Tenaya Canyon\nis not for you. If you're looking for a physically easy jaunt, Tenaya\nCanyon is probably not for you.</p>\n<p>This is likely <strong>not a beginner canyon</strong>. The rope work\nis generally straightforward but the canyon requires a significant\namount of technical downclimbing and boulder hopping over the course of\na very long day. Previous experience with downclimbing or rock climbing\nshould be considered a prerequisite.</p>\n<p>If you are looking for a full day hiking with hours of class 3\ndownclimbing through a beautiful Yosemite Gorge with unique views of\nhalf dome, playing in swimming holes, lapping waterslides, and enjoying\na few jumps and rappels, then you should have a great time. The hardest\npart is setting a shuttle and dealing with the giant cluster#$@! that is\nYosemite Valley.</p>\n<p>One appealing aspect, is that you don't need much technical gear. As\nyou'll probably be descending in midsummer, wetsuits should be\nunnecessary, unless the weather is doing something very weird. This is\ngood, because wet sections are spaced out. You might get a bit chilly in\nthe gorge, but it's over too soon to be a problem. Also you don't need a\nvery long rope: 70 feet is the largest rappel all the way to the canyon\nfloor. Some teams may opt to jump or down climb some of the rappels, but\nbringing a rope is advised regardless, especially given the remoteness\nof the location.</p>\n<p>During the descent it is possible to pick up cell signal by the\nLonely Boulder and other places. This can greatly help in navigation,\nbut don't count on it. It is easy to get benighted in Tenaya Canyon. An\nearly start, headlamps and emergency clothing should be required. Many\nteams experience route finding difficulties and have been forced to\nspend the night. Don't underestimate the time required or the effort\ninvolved.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>Hike East out of the Sunrise Trailhead and cross Tenaya Creek. Stay\non the trail a short additional distance until the Sunrise Trail starts\nto ascend a short rocky section. Follow a feint trail to the right\nthrough the forest. Initially you will be walking through the forest,\noccasionally changing which side you are walking on. Eventually the\ncanyon opens more with less trees. Traversing on the LDC side is\neasiest.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Eventually you get to a gorge with a sign telling you how dangerous\nit is to continue. Are you making a huge mistake?</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>Head down the slabs from here. There is a deep pothole which can be\nfun to jump into (always scout landings first!). Just below this is the\npopular Tenaya Slide, a low angle slide, which is fun but can get scary\nwith higher water.</p>\n<p>This is followed by a lot more hiking through forests. Eventually you\nhit bedrock again, and get to another fun little slide! This one is\nsteep, and about 15 feet into a pool. Enjoy this for a bit. This pool is\nlocated at 37.78720, -119.48542. (7520 ft elevation) </p>\n<p>Gully route: PROS: Lots of potentially enjoyable boulder downclimbs.\nFind pieces of airplane wreckage. Views of Pywiack. CONS: Extremely\nminor amounts of bushwhacking. Extra 200 feet of elevation gain. High\nlevels of exposure at certain points; people have fallen and died here\nbefore. To take the gully route, head north up the ridge, climbing ~400\nfeet of elevation, then drop into the big drainage on the left (be\ncareful not to follow the right drainage instead; it looks more\nappealing from the top but has cliffs lower down). Follow down the left\nside of this drainage, to hit a minor, slightly brushy gully where\neverything drops off. Going to the right (down the drainage proper) is\ndoable, but requires much more challenging downclimbing (and possibly a\nfew rappels). Lots more boulder hopping down from the airplane engine\nthat hangs out at the confluence. If your group is uncomfortable with\nthe downclimbing / boulder hopping through this section know that it\ngets worse, not better, further down.</p>\n<p>Slab route: PROS: More straightforward. More efficient if everyone\nknows how slab climbing works, is cool with exposure, and has sticky\nrubber shoes. CONS: Substantial risk of injury or death. I do not think\nthat the GPX file is entirely accurate. Find your own route, but for a\ngeneral guideline, hike up to a lone boulder that hangs out up on the\nridge to the southwest. From the pool (at 37.78720, -119.48542 and 7520\nfeet elevation) head up the steep exposed rock face. The lone boulder is\nnot visible until you are almost at it. The lone boulder is located at\n37.785749, -119.486485 at at an approximate elevation of 7720 feet.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Next, hike down to the talus slope a short distance below. and head\nroughly 206 magnetic north or 218 true north for 1400 feet. You will\npass through some brushy area, but in an area that is not too dense. If\nyou go lower, you will have to traverse through very very thick brush.\nYour goal is to traverse to the far side of a small bowl or watershed.\nIf you drop down too early, you will find steeper slabs and overhangs\nwith wet patches. This area is very dangerous. You should continue\nsouthwest as mentioned, cross what is shown on the topo as a water\ncourse and then proceed downslope. Navigate towards\n37.7837468,-119.4917484 where the ridge and crack systems descend. If\nyou are at the correct location, the inverse V shaped vegetation at the\nbase will be slightly to your left. At the very base of the slabs, there\nis a large pine tree to head for. Along the route down the 1250 feet of\nslabs, there are occasional places where a rope can be used as a\nhandline and pulled down afterwards.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>From the large pine tree at the base, descend the talus, then switch\nback up and left through a little brush to more talus descending.\nEventually crash through more brush to reach the LDC side of Tenaya\nCreek. Avoid the waterfall by traversing left down canyon.</p>\n<p>If you took the slab route, descend directly into the bottom of the\ncanyon to avoid missing the big slide/sweet swimming hole. If you took\nthe gully, you won't miss it.</p>\n<p>If interested in the big slide: First off, careful for slick granite\nall through here. The route I recommend for the big slide requires some\ntricky climbing on slick slab. But, as long as you are careful getting\nto the tricky part, falling will just send you sliding down the polished\ngranite next to the slide, which is also fine. Walk down the left side\nof the waterfall on the top side of a ~5 foot high ledge that parallels\nthe fall. Around here you'll see a spot where you can climb down this\nledge easily. From there, follow close to the ledge another ~10 feet\ndown, just above the last ~2 foot high ledge that cuts over toward the\nfalls. Now carefully traverse toward the water. Once you're close, lower\nyourself down slowly past that small ledge, and catch a small lip with\nyour feet, and you're set up perfect for the slide! While it may be\npossible to just take this from the top, I would caution that you are\ngoing to be coming in HOT when you hit the water, and if the small bumps\nabove my recommended entrance turn you sideways, you might rearrange\nyour back upon entrance. Given the remoteness of this spot, it is sadly,\nprobably not a great idea to give it a go.</p>\n<p>More hiking and climbing down canyon. Usually, you are walking along\na rock strewn streambed. In later summer, most of this is dry streambed.\nAs you approach the inner gorge, the water comes to the surface again.\nYou might need to make small detours through the woods. Lots of hiking\nand scrambling. You were warned.</p>\n<p>Pretty soon you get to the start of the gorge! It begins with either\nthe 70ft rappel (bolted, and accessed by traversing far on ledges on the\nright, a good ways down canyon; if you hit the end of the ledge\nbacktrack 15-30 feet to look for bolts) or an excellent ~30-35 foot jump\nfrom the very beginning of that ledge. Note that it may be possible to\njump too far, and find the wall on the other side. In between this jump\nand the bottom of the rappel is a large boulder that can make for\nanother jump, if you are careful and check the landing. The bolts are\ntwo good 3/8 inch and have rappel rings.</p>\n<p>There are a total of 4 rappels throughout the gorge. About 400 feet\ndownstream of the first 70 foot rappel, you reach LeConte Boulder.\n(37.77640, -119.50345) It's possible to slide and swim along the LDC\nside of the boulder, but there are two large rocks at the top with\nslings and rappel rings. (Replace them if they look weathered) This is a\nrappel of about 40 feet and if there is water in the canyon, you will\nlikely get wet. Careful navigation in the pool below will mean that you\nonly get wet to waist level. If you slide or downclimb LDC, be sure to\ncheck your landings. The LeConte Boulder is named after the famous\ngeologist and University of South Carolina and University of California\nprofessor, Joseph LeConte.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Boulder hopping downstream. Look for a bypass for the trickiest bits\non the right. Further down a series of big wide ledges goes out to the\nright. Occasionally, there are a few narrow, exposed ledges, one in\nparticularly is crumbly. At a small ravine, don't descend to the canyon\nfloor, go upwards and descend back to the large ledge. There are a few\ndifferent ways to use these to get down (including bolts nearish the end\nof the ledges). Some are easier than others. This 3rd rappel is about 70\nfeet. Two 3/8 inch bolts with rap rings are used. The landing is usually\ndry during the late summer season. The rappel is at approximately\n37.772782,-119.506782.</p>\n<p>The last significant drop is a 2 part rappel (or 4th rappel,\n37.77210, -119.50759) at a sliding waterfall that moves from the left to\nthe right side of the canyon. Here you can rappel from 2 pairs of 3/8\ninch bolts with rap rings; the first is off the top of a boulder (as\npictured), and the next pair is next to the sliding waterfall (RDC).\nThey are located RDC on a shelf about 3 feet above where you will\nprobably be standing. Rappel at an angle to the rappellers left (RDC) to\navoid dropping into a pothole about 2/3 of the way down. At the base of\nthe drop you can be out of the water, but immediately afterwards there\nis a pool. You can avoid the water by a stiff climb on RDC, up about 10\nfeet to a ledge and then descend immediately to the opposite side of the\npool.</p>\n<p>The canyon opens up, a boulder strewn streambed awaits you for some\ndistance. This is the end of the inner gorge, but more difficulties are\nahead.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>While the most technical portions of Tenaya Canyon are behind you, do\nnot underestimate the length of time and difficulty of navigation below\nthe inner gorge. Hike downstream across a vast floodplain that fills the\nvalley. It's flat for a while, and the water likely disappears below\nground. At the first fork after the gorge, head RDC for an easier exit.\nThere are areas of forest where the stream has disappeared. This area is\nnot easy to navigate at night. There are about 3 very steep sections\nwith large boulders. The first drop and large boulder makes a good bivy\nspot (37.76458, -119.51910). At this location, go into the forest on\nLDC. It's much easier to descend through the forest than over the\nsteeply dropping boulders and a myriad of down climbs. After this is\nanother short, relatively flat boulder strewn streambed. Other boulder\nchoke/drops can be bypassed on RDC. Where it gets steep, and the water\ncomes back, cut right to find a small path. The trail can be found at\n37.760488, -119.526758. Initially, the trail is very feint but later it\nis also marked by cairns. It takes a bit of effort, and is hard to\nfollow in places, but this path can bring you all the way down to the\ntrail. Watch for a bit of poison oak on the way. When you cross Snow\nCreek near the bottom, stay low, and ignore the old horse trail that\nheads straight up hill. You'll hit official trails soon. From the\nofficial trail to the backpackers parking area near the foot of Glacier\nPoint, it takes 1.5 hours of walking.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Which way to go once you hit them kind of depends on where you found\nparking, it will be necessary to navigate to the parking lot where you\nleft your shuttle vehicles.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<p>Currently you need a parking day use permit to leave a car in\nYosemite at the entrance and at the exit. You can get this for $2 online\nif you have a NP pass. Just dealing with Yosemite traffic etc. Don't\nleave food in your car. You would need a permit to do this as an\novernight.</p>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><img src=\"rwl_en.png\" title=\"rwl_en.png\" alt=\"rwl_en.png\" /><a\nhref=\"http://brennen.caltech.edu/swhikes/tenaya.htm\">Chris Brennen's\nAdventure Hikes (Southwest)</a> : Tenaya Creek</li>\n<li><img src=\"rwl_en.png\" title=\"rwl_en.png\" alt=\"rwl_en.png\" /><a\nhref=\"http://canyonchronicles.com/tenaya-canyon?kmlidx=205701186783545362755.0004e5388fca109c95672\">CanyonChronicles.com</a>\n: Tenaya Canyon</li>\n<li><img src=\"rwl_en.png\" title=\"rwl_en.png\" alt=\"rwl_en.png\" /><a\nhref=\"http://hikearizona.com/decoder.php?ZTN=16911\">HikeArizona.com</a>\n: Tenaya Canyon</li>\n<li><img src=\"rwl_en.png\" title=\"rwl_en.png\" alt=\"rwl_en.png\" /><a\nhref=\"http://summitpost.org/tenaya-canyon/160152\">SummitPost.org</a> :\nTenaya Canyon</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a\nhref=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/madzoy/sets/72157635008436633/\">Pictures\nfrom 2013</a></li>\n<li><a\nhref=\"http://www.rockandice.com/lates-news/massive-rockfall-in-yosemite-tenaya-canyon/\">Rockfall\nJune 2015</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n<p>John Muir ascended the canyon in 1872 and nearly died from a fall\nbefore the inner gorge. Apparently, he fell at one of the huge boulder\nchokes. He was knocked unconscious for an unknown length of time but\nwoke up and staggered to the downstream entrance to the inner gorge\nwhere he spent the night. He then took a day to explore the inner gorge\nand somehow made it all the way up to Tenaya Lake. At that point, he\ntook another route back to the Valley to the north of Tenaya Canyon. <a\nhref=\"https://vault.sierraclub.org/john_muir_exhibit/writings/steep_trails/chapter_2.aspx\">John\nMuir in Tenaya Canyon</a></p>\n<p>As previously mentioned, the LeConte Boulder is named after the\nfamous geologist, Joseph LeConte who had a very interesting life.</p>\n<p>Tenaya Canyon has had more than 17 people killed there and many more\ninjured. It is known to the Park Service as the Bermuda Triangle of\nYosemite. To most canyoneers, it's known for the hike rather than the\ntechnical parts of the canyon. However, there are many areas, especially\nthe descent through the slabs where a mis-step could have deadly\nconsequences. Some groups see that it's suggested to take 10 hours to\ntraverse the canyon and they enjoy swimming in several pools or have\ntrouble with route finding and they are benighted. It's recommended that\nif you do not know this canyon that you go prepared to spend the night\nin an emergency.</p>\n",
