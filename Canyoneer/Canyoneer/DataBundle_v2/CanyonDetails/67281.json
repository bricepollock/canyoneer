{"description":"<div class=\"mw-content-ltr mw-parser-output\" lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><p>Technical Gear: pothole escape gear, a couple of sandtraps, a couple of water anchors, canyoneering gear, and a small raft for a shuttle.\nWe have not found a beta or name for this canyon.  We also did not see evidence of a prior descent, though conditions may have changed. \nThe group is Bruce, Jason, Wil, and Gus\n<\/p><p>This canyon is an upgrade to the Excalibur canyon hence the name Merlin. Although it is a shorter one, it has bigger features and requires canyoners with advanced sandtrap, water anchor, fiddlestick, and pothole escape skills.\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Merlin shares the same trailhead and approach as Excalibur, it takes a \"shortcut\" and ends at the last 3rd of Excalibur. \n<\/p><p>From the start, the approach is steep for about 1,500 ft. followed by a steady climb of 500 ft until the last steep section of 100 ft. Thereafter almost no elevation hike until the top of the canyon.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>There is the option to start at waypoint Top1 (36.91165, -111.32308), it has a low height narrow section followed by a Rap of 40'. This upper section can be bypassed right-down-canyon until you reach waypoint Top2 (36.91358, -111.32306), where you commit and the fun begins.\n<\/p><p>It starts with a sandtrap (15’)  leading to a semi keeper pothole. After a few steps, there is a pothole reachable with a handline and exit with partner assist from that lip you can see a beautiful rappel of 40' that requires a sandtrap leading to a pothole. Before descending it requires to throw a 40  potshot to the crack to hold the pull as it is a flat area. \n<style data-mw-deduplicate=\"TemplateStyles:r1062633282\">@media all and (max-width:720px){.mw-parser-output .content .thumb>div:not(.thumbinner){display:flex;justify-content:center;flex-wrap:wrap;align-content:flex-start;flex-direction:column}}body.skin-vector .mw-parser-output div.thumb>div:not(.thumbinner){font-size:94%;text-align:center;overflow:hidden;min-width:100px}body.skin-minerva .mw-parser-output div.thumb>div:not(.thumbinner){margin:0 auto;max-width:100%!important}<\/style> \n<\/p>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\">\n<div style=\"display:table;\">\n<span class=\"mw-default-size\" typeof=\"mw:Error mw:File\/Frameless\">\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>Walk for a couple of minutes, you will find a pothole avoidable by walking left-down-canyon on a small ledge.\n<\/p><p>Here will be an ideal place to set up the sandtrap rap 35' into an open area.\n<\/p><p>Next, you will see a large bowl where you can set up a sandtrap (50') right-down-canyon or use a small tree left-down-canyon with a fiddlestick (our choice).\n<\/p><p>After a couple of minutes, you will see the largest feature of the canyon. It is the 200' rap from a sandtrap from a tiny lip (we had to dry and dig the sand) at the edge of the cliff (you have the option to build it way back where you will need a longer rope). Half of the rap is free-hanging (scary for the LPD), in the middle, there are a lot of large size bushes where the backpack can get stock if you decide to hang it. \n<\/p><p>At the end of the rap, there is a series of 3 potholes, you can use a pack toss for the first one. If you have a 240' rope you can make it a two-stage rap to skip building a water anchor or sand trap. The pull is good on this second pothole ledge.  For the last pothole, we built a water (sandtrap if it is dry) anchor to the rappel down 40' to the end of the canyon, now you are in Excalibur with about a 3rd to go.  Magnificent!!\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>If you do not find details about Excalibur, the end of Excalibur has a couple of handlines and partner captures, sandtraps\/water-anchors. The end is a sequence of three-stage rappel that can be done with one 220'x2 rope from a rebar 7' high RDC or you can set up three sandtraps\/water-anchors raps (watch for rope pinch, clean the narrow areas of debris).\n<\/p><p>Depending on the water level you may walk for a couple to 15 min to the lake where you take the small raft to get to your boat.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Red_tape\">Red tape<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Beta_sites\">Beta sites<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Background\">Background<\/h2><\/div>\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nParsed by mw‐api‐ext.codfw.main‐6779cc57fc‐xflrr\nCached time: 20240914191905\nCache expiry: 2592000\nReduced expiry: false\nComplications: [show‐toc]\nCPU time usage: 0.032 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.039 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 115\/1000000\nPost‐expand include size: 605\/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 20\/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 8\/100\nExpensive parser function count: 0\/500\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0\/20\nUnstrip post‐expand size: 529\/5000000 bytes\nLua time usage: 0.002\/10.000 seconds\nLua memory usage: 606898\/52428800 bytes\nNumber of Wikibase entities loaded: 0\/400\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%   28.354      1 -total\n100.00%   28.354      1 Template:Pic\n 53.50%   15.169      1 Template:Str_number\/trim\n-->\n<\/div>","geojson":null,"rappelCountMin":10,"quality":5,"waterRating":"B","rappelCountMax":15,"vehicle":null,"longitude":-111.323,"shuttleSeconds":300,"timeRating":"IV","rappelLongestMeters":67.06,"months":["Mar","Apr","May","Sep","Oct","Nov"],"id":67281,"permit":"No","latitude":36.9135,"name":"Merlin Canyon","technicalRating":4,"version":"619b78a0542aef8880581b19b2b463d0454bf479189659016a817cb35b3a2844","url":"https:\/\/ropewiki.com\/Merlin_Canyon","riskRating":"R"}
