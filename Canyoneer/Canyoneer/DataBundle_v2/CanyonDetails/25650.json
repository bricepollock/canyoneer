  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>Around the small village of Adolfo Lopez Mateos there are several\ninteresting river caves. The largest and most beautiful is the Cueva\nEjidal, sometimes also referred as Cueva Osman, technically a nearby\nriver cave to which is connected.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>After arranging access (see red tape), park at the entrance of town\nand take an unmarked trail left up a ravine and down into the main\nentrance of Ejidal. A set of carved steps allow easy access inside the\ncave.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>Ejidal cave is made up of two superimposed levels.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Upper level: dry and with several very large rooms, this section is\nnothing too spectacular but still nice to visit.</li>\n<li>Lower level: the lower level is traversed by a stream formed by the\nconfluence of several underground rivers, this is by far the most\ninteresting and beautiful part of the cave. It can also be very sporty\nwhen the river is flowing strong and should be avoided if rains are in\nthe forecast.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Best way to visit the cave is to explore the upper section first, and\nthen drop down the lower section from one of the multiple holes that\nconnect the levels. Choose how to climb to the lower level wisely, some\nof the connecting holes are steep but can be negotiated with a handline,\nothers will require full vertical gear.</p>\n<p>The lower passage extends upstream for a long way, it eventually\nreaches a big room with multiple passages branching off but too small\nfor humans. The lower section keeps going for even longer, it may seem\nit ends in siphons here and there, but these can always be bypassed.\nEventually you reach a confluence with another underground stream that\ndoubles the flow, and if you keep going, local guides claim you can exit\nthrough a resurgence and/or connect to Osman cave. Our team could not\nreach that point, after recent rains the river passage was very sporty\nalready (a siphon partially swallowed one of the team members) and at\nthe confluence the current was too strong to allow safe progress.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>If you are adventurous, you can run a through trip. If water is too\nhigh, you can retrace your steps and exit the way you came.</p>\n<p>Besides Cueva Osman, there are other lesser caves in the vicinity\nthat might be worth visiting if you have time:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Cueva de Pedro y Manuel: a grand portal and magnificent fossil (dry)\ngallery (600m)</li>\n<li>Cueva del Naranjo: five entrances to an underground river which\ncrosses the karst cones receiving contributions from the several\nsurrounding cockpits (2.5km)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you have time, it is well worth to stay in town for dinner.\nLourdes (Bartolo's daughter) cooks homemade dinners using the local\nproduce from their farm. The fresh corn tortillas and the tamales are\namazing.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<p>Cueva Ejidal/Osman are semi-commercial. The landowners together with\nlocal authorities offer tourists the opportunity of visiting the cave.\nSome sort of payment is required in order to gain access to the cave,\nand only the owner and his sons are allowed to guide. When you arrive to\ntown, go to Bartolo's house (the land owner) and tell him you want to\nvisit the cave. Negotiate the price with him or with your appointed\nguide before you start the approach. Make sure to tell them you want to\nvisit the lower section (the river cave), otherwise they may go\nunprepared and only guide you through the upper section, which is not\nvery beautiful nor interesting.</p>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a\nhref=\"http://www.mexicancaves.org/maps/1092.pdf\">http://www.mexicancaves.org/maps/1092.pdf</a>\nPDF Map of the cave</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n",
