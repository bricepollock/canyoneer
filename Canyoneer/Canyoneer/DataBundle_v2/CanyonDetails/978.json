Inflate your watercraft here if the water is low and space allows. In fuller conditions it is best to inflate your boats at the roomy area at the top of the second to last rappel. a 200' rope and pull will get you to the river.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>After gathering the ropes packraft to Lee's Ferry 12 miles OR arrange a pick up at petroglyph beach just down river.
