If you have a high clearance 4x4 and are comfortable driving in deep, soft sand you can make it much closer to the start.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>A few deep potholes (one or 2 potential keepers) and a couple of shorter raps (bolts) bring you to the staging area at the top of the last rap. Inflate your watercraft here if the water is low and space allows. In fuller conditions it is best to inflate your boats at the roomy area at the top of the second to last rappel. a 200' rope and pull will get you to the river.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>After gathering the ropes packraft to Lee's Ferry 12 miles OR arrange a pick up at petroglyph beach just down river. Either way a personal watercraft is needed to exit the canyon. \n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Background\">Background<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Originally explored in 2011 with fixed ropes by Clint Poole.
