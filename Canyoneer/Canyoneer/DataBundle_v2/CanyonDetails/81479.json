  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>Lafferty Creek is a creek draining into the mighty Nahanni River. Of\nthe 900 or so annual visitors that float the Nahanni River each summer,\nmany of them do stop to hike to Lafferty Canyon. There's no other\nrealistic way to access this canyon than from a weeklong (or longer)\nfloat trip down the Nahanni River.</p>\n<p>This slot is short, nontechnical, but very beautiful. It's documented\nhere more for 'armchair canyoneering' and entertainment - it's not a\ndestination in itself. It is, interestingly, perhaps the northernmost\nslot canyon yet documented in the world, depending on how you define a\nslot. On a river trip, it makes an excellent stop. There are multiple\nknown and explored caves in the cliffs around the canyon, and certainly\nmany, many more caves that remain to be found and explored.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>From your boats at the river, hike up the river drainage about 1.5\nmiles until it tapers into the obvious slot.</p>\n<p>The trail crisscrosses the creek several times. Might as well just\nget your feet wet in the beginning, as you're going to get a lot more\nwet when you enter the slot.</p>\n<p>When you get to the slot, you can either take an approach trail on\nthe left, and then downclimb the slot, or, if skilled, you can just\nupclimb the entire slot, and then return back down it.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>The slot is short, but has several small waterfalls to carefully\ndownclimb, and several short swims. The water is significantly warmer\nthan the Nahanni River - perhaps 65F in July?</p>\n<p>There are no major features or obstacles that need specific\ninstruction to pass. Probably the trickiest downclimb is on the smooth\nrock with poor footholds and handholds right at the top of the slot.\nYou'll have to hug the wall for a few cautious steps next to a\nthundering waterfall before jumping into a frigid poor (make sure\nsomeone checks depth first).</p>\n<p>Take your time, enjoy the slot, because it opens and ends all too\nquickly.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>Walk back to your boat on the river the same way you came.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<p>No red tape.</p>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<p><a\nhref=\"https://www.lukaseddy.com/nahanni-packraft-expedition\">https://www.lukaseddy.com/nahanni-packraft-expedition</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n<p>Likely first explored in the late 1800s or early 1900s by trappers.\nUnknown if they actually upclimbed the slot. It may have been known to\nnative peoples beforehand as well.</p>\n",
