class=\"mw-content-ltr mw-parser-output\" lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><p>Be aware: Munra Creek was overrun by the Eagle Creek wildfire in Sept 2017.  It is not what it was (post-fire, it's now a 2.5-3 star creek), and has become largely overgrown with brush\/briars so it is best run in the winter\/early spring. Please use caution when descending the creek. Between landslides, fallen trees, and loose rocks, this area may be unstable and dangerous for years to come. \n<\/p><p>Munra Creek is a lesser tributary of Tanner Creek and sports some seven rappels, three of them being over 100ft high. With a small, relatively low elevation watershed (0.7mi^2), it's a good choice early in the season. Waterflow is best in the spring and reduces substantially heading into summer.\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Best_Practices\">Best Practices<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Prior to the Eagle Creek fire in 2017, Munra Creek was seeing increased visitation and signs of abuse.  Please use anchors in or adjacent to the watercourse as much as possible.  Climbing to trees higher up on the sides is attractive, but risks trampling vegetation and eroding the banks.  Riparian environments in the Pacific NW are extremely fragile. Munra has been the site of several rescues in the past. Don't be one of them.\n<\/p>\n<ul><li>Teaching people to rappel for the first time in an aquatic canyon is not a good plan.  It's much safer to become fully proficient with rappel devices outside the canyon in a safe dry environment.<\/li><\/ul>\n<ul><li>Wrapping the rope around trees for a two strand rappel is efficient, but is not good for the tree when you go to pull your rope.  Friction damage around the back of the tree cuts into the bark.  Done too many times by too many people and the tree will become girdled and eventually die.  It's often kinder to the tree to set an anchor or use a retrievable system.<\/li><\/ul>\n<ul><li>Beginners \"leading\" beginners is a common cause of accidents in canyoneering.  Enthusiasm is not a substitute for training by a qualified instructor.<\/li><\/ul>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading3\"><h3 id=\"Parking_\/_Shuttle\"><span id=\"Parking_.2F_Shuttle\"><\/span>Parking \/ Shuttle<\/h3><\/div>\n<p>From I-84, take exit 40. South of the highway, the road splits: the right fork leading to the Wahclella Falls trailhead, and left up and over the hill to the Tooth Rock trailhead. You can park at either one. Canyon groups will usually hike (or shuttle) between the two along the road.  The bike trail along I-84 is better than hiking up and over the hill.\n<\/p>\n<ul><li>WARNING: This area is extremely popular and high risk for car break-ins. Do not leave anything valuable (or anything that looks like it could be valuable - ex: packs, bags, purses, etc.) visible in your car.<\/li><\/ul>\n<ul><li>Parking at the Tooth Rock trailhead is likely a little safer, but still best to leave nothing of value in your car.<\/li><\/ul>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading3\"><h3 id=\"Hike\">Hike<\/h3><\/div>\n<p>From the Tooth Rock trailhead, walk back up the hill to the water tower where you'll find Forest Road 777 (gated). Follow FR 777 for 2mi to a sharp right bend where it crosses Munra Creek. This was the old trailhead for Tanner Butte (#401) which is still closed (as of Dec 2023) post-fire. Suit up and drop into the now-overgrown creek.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<ul><li>R1: 110ft via dead, but sturdy tree DCR. There is a large, but mobile, old-growth log in the center of the creek that is not the best option. Beware loose rock.<\/li>\n<li>R2: 130ft from tree DCL. Beware rockfall. Once at the bottom, stay well back from the base of the pitch.<\/li>\n<li>R3: 70ft from dead snag DCL located about 30 feet back from the falls. A 220' rope is sufficient.<\/li>\n<li>R4: 30ft from a fallen log.  Climb down across the logjam mess at the bottom and scoot down the big old-growth log.<\/li>\n<li>R5: 50ft from log DCR. Beware rootball DCR at the bottom of the falls.<\/li>\n<li>R6: 80ft from a dead snag DCR. This drop is a good candidate for bolting. Drop is two-tier with a pocket in the middle, channeling flow. It's possible stem over the top of the pocket with some fancy footwork.<\/li>\n<li>R7: Munra Falls: 130ft from  a tree set well back DCR.  There's a lovely grassy platform to start before you head into this rampy waterfall. Beware throwing your rope or rope bag down the pitch. The Wahclella Falls trail crosses the creek on a bridge right at the bottom of the falls and throwing ropes may endanger hikers. Also beware knocking down rocks. You will likely have an audience while rappelling.<\/li><\/ul>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Follow the trail downstream\/north to the Wahclella Falls trailhead and your car.

Most weekends you will find the trail crowded with visitors. Be aware that canyoning is less well-known in this area, and, sometimes, hikers may react inappropriately to canyoning activities, leading to degraded relations with land managers.
