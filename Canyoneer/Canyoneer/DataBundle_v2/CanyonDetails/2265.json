  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>Non-technical, but extraordinarily beautiful river gorge. Great way\nto cool off on a hot summer's day - or possibly a rest day between\ntechnical outings. Consider wearing a PFD or have your flotation dialed\nas there are some very long stretches of swimming. There is lots of jump\npotential along the way. It's something of a non-technical water park.\nHelmets are a good idea for safety as the rock surfaces can be extremely\nslippery. Slipping and banging your head is no fun.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>If you don't have a shuttle, walking the road is feasible. The\nshoulder is pretty wide, except for one short narrow section. Takes\n~40min.</p>\n<h3 id=\"lower_trailhead\">Lower Trailhead</h3>\n<p>From Sweet Home, follow Hwy 20 east for ~14.5mi and turn off\nleft/north into Cascadia State Park. On entering the park, bear right\nand park in the West Picnic Area.</p>\n<h3 id=\"upper_trailhead\">Upper Trailhead</h3>\n<p>Head back out and continue east on Hwy 20 for 2.2mi. Turn off left\nonto Moose Mountain Rd. Go 0.1mi to the bridge and continue just a bit\nfurther to find a place to park on the left. A short easy trail leads\ndown to the river from here. Either suit up at the cars or down on the\ngravel bar.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>Head downstream. Hike along one side or the other, rock-hop, wade,\nbody-surf, or swim. The canyon walls soon close in to become a narrows\nwhich come and go for the next two miles. There are a large number of\nmandatory swims; some are quite long. Be sure you have your flotation\ndialed. PFDs recommended for weaker swimmers. There are many beautiful\nwater features, water-worn rock formations, and miniature arches. There\nis lots of jump potential. There are two obstacles of note:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Tomco Falls - 15ft. Bypass/downclimb/jump DCR. Moose Creek dumps in\non the DCR side of the falls. (Beware: There appears to be a significant\nsiphon - e.g. giant underwater arch - at the base of the chute that most\nof the current flows through in summer. Use caution when playing in the\nswiftwater.)</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Unnamed rapid not far below Tomco. Jump (or downclimb and slide in)\nDCR.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Be aware: this canyon is likely dangerous in high flow. It is best\nvisited on a hot summer day when the current is slow and weak. Even in\nlate summer, the current can be pushy where the river gets funneled\nthrough narrow openings.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>Just before the Cascadia State Park bridge, exit DCR on very obvious\ntrail. Follow trail short distance up, bearing left at all junctions to\nthe parking lot.</p>\n<p>Alternatively you can shorten the trip by exiting either at Canyon\nCreek or Wolf Creek, both DCL. There are pullouts on the road at both\nlocations. The final section between Canyon Creek and Cascadia State\npark, while lovely, greets you with diminishing returns for you\nefforts.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<p>There are a number of ladders and stairs along the way; do not climb\nthem as they lead up to private homes above the gorge. Closer to\nCascadia State Park, you may encounter swimmers, fishermen, and families\nlounging out on the bedrock. All of them will likely be surprised by\nyour appearance from up-river. May be better to visit midweek for more\nsolitude.</p>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><img src=\"rwl_en.png\" title=\"rwl_en.png\" alt=\"rwl_en.png\" /><a\nhref=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20210527212206/www.canyoneeringnorthwest.com/SouthSantiam/South-Santiam-River.php\">CanyoneeringNorthwest.com\n(archive.org)</a> : South Santiam River</li>\n<li><a\nhref=\"http://www.oregonhikers.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=10&amp;t=25896\">Zach\nForsyth TR</a></li>\n<li><a\nhref=\"http://oregonstateparks.org/index.cfm?do=parkPage.dsp_parkPage&amp;parkId=150\">Cascadia\nState Park</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n",
