Great way to cool off on a hot summer's day - or possibly a rest day between technical outings.  Consider wearing a PFD or have your flotation dialed as there are some very long stretches of swimming.  There is lots of jump potential along the way. It's something of a non-technical water park. Helmets are a good idea for safety as the rock surfaces can be extremely slippery.  Slipping and banging your head is no fun.\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>If you don't have a shuttle, walking the road is feasible.  The shoulder is pretty wide, except for one short narrow section.  Takes ~40min.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading3\"><h3 id=\"Lower_Trailhead\">Lower Trailhead<\/h3><\/div>\n<p>From Sweet Home, follow Hwy 20 east for ~14.5mi and turn off left\/north into Cascadia State Park.  On entering the park, bear right and park in the West Picnic Area.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading3\"><h3 id=\"Upper_Trailhead\">Upper Trailhead<\/h3><\/div>\n<p>Head back out and continue east on Hwy 20 for 2.2mi.  Turn off left onto Moose Mountain Rd.  Go 0.1mi to the bridge and continue just a bit further to find a place to park on the left. A short easy trail leads down to the river from here. Either suit up at the cars or down on the gravel bar.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Head downstream.  Hike along one side or the other, rock-hop, wade, body-surf, or swim.  The canyon walls soon close in to become a narrows which come and go for the next two miles.  There are a large number of mandatory swims;  some are quite long.  Be sure you have your flotation dialed.  PFDs recommended for weaker swimmers.  There are many beautiful water features, water-worn rock formations, and miniature arches.  There is lots of jump potential.  There are two obstacles of note:\n<\/p>\n<ul><li>Tomco Falls - 15ft.  Bypass\/downclimb\/jump DCR.  Moose Creek dumps in on the DCR side of the falls.  (Beware: There appears to be a significant siphon - e.g. giant underwater arch - at the base of the chute that most of the current flows through in summer. Use caution when playing in the swiftwater.)<\/li><\/ul>\n<style data-mw-deduplicate=\"TemplateStyles:r1062633282\">@media all and (max-width:720px){.mw-parser-output .content .thumb>div:not(.thumbinner){display:flex;justify-content:center;flex-wrap:wrap;align-content:flex-start;flex-direction:column}}body.skin-vector .mw-parser-output div.thumb>div:not(.thumbinner){font-size:94%;text-align:center;overflow:hidden;min-width:100px}body.skin-minerva .mw-parser-output div.thumb>div:not(.thumbinner){margin:0 auto;max-width:100%!important}<\/style> \n<div class=\"thumb tright\">\n<div style=\"display:table;\">\n<span class=\"mw-default-size\" typeof=\"mw:Error mw:File\/Frameless\">\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<ul><li>Unnamed rapid not far below Tomco.

Follow trail short distance up, bearing left at all junctions to the parking lot.\n<\/p><p>Alternatively you can shorten the trip by exiting either at Canyon Creek or Wolf Creek, both DCL.  There are pullouts on the road at both locations.  The final section between Canyon Creek and Cascadia State park, while lovely, greets you with diminishing returns for you efforts.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Red_tape\">Red tape<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>There are a number of ladders and stairs along the way;  do not climb them as they lead up to private homes above the gorge.  Closer to Cascadia State Park, you may encounter swimmers, fishermen, and families lounging out on the bedrock. All of them will likely be surprised by your appearance from up-river.  May be better to visit midweek for more solitude.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Beta_sites\">Beta sites<\/h2><\/div>\n<ul><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20210527212206\/www.canyoneeringnorthwest.com\/SouthSantiam\/South-Santiam-River.php\">CanyoneeringNorthwest.com (archive.org)<\/a> &#160;: South Santiam River<\/li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http:\/\/www.oregonhikers.org\/forum\/viewtopic.php?f=10&amp;t=25896\">Zach Forsyth TR<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http:\/\/oregonstateparks.org\/index.cfm?do=parkPage.dsp_parkPage&amp;parkId=150\">Cascadia State Park<\/a><\/li><\/ul>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Background\">Background<\/h2><\/div>\n\n\n<\/div>","geojson":{"type":"FeatureCollection","features":[{"properties":{"stroke":"#FF0000","name":"Descent"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"LineString","coordinates":[[-122.43542,44.4021,0],[-122.436966,44.4021,0],[-122.43748,44.401703,0],[-122.43928,44.401028,0],[-122.44074,44.400047,0],[-122.44186,44.39931,0],[-122.444214,44.398483,0],[-122.44576,44.39787,0],[-122.447136,44.397533,0],[-122.44898,44.397655,0],[-122.45018,44.397625,0],[-122.45237,44.39787,0],[-122.45396,44.398483,0],[-122.45507,44.398727,0],[-122.45636,44.39836,0],[-122.45855,44.397472,0],[-122.461334,44.39695,0],[-122.46387,44.396458,0],[-122.46679,44.396366,0],[-122.46846,44.396828,0],[-122.47009,44.39686,0],[-122.47258,44.39692,0],[-122.4743,44.397316,0],[-122.4758,44.39787,0],[-122.47726,44.398205,0],[-122.47923,44.398083,0],[-122.480095,44.398144,0],[-122.48031,44.398453,0],[-122.48056,44.398727,0]]}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"LineString","coordinates":[[-122.48095,44.39895,0],[-122.48121,44.398735,0],[-122.4812,44.398724,0],[-122.48127,44.3987,0],[-122.48127,44.3987,0],[-122.48127,44.3987,0],[-122.48118,44.39792,0],[-122.48102,44.39722,0],[-122.48102,44.39722,0],[-122.48043,44.39727,0],[-122.47965,44.39729,0],[-122.47887,44.39725,0],[-122.47559,44.39663,0],[-122.47559,44.39663,0],[-122.47438,44.3964,0],[-122.47171,44.39615,0],[-122.46592,44.3958,0],[-122.46518,44.3958,0],[-122.46518,44.3958,0],[-122.46518,44.3958,0],[-122.46446,44.39587,0],[-122.45443,44.39737,0],[-122.45361,44.39747,0],[-122.45361,44.39747,0],[-122.45299,44.3975,0],[-122.45216,44.39744,0],[-122.45216,44.39744,0],[-122.451065,44.39722,0],[-122.451065,44.39722,0],[-122.44991,44.39699,0],[-122.44886,44.39684,0],[-122.44812,44.3968,0],[-122.44742,44.39681,0],[-122.4466,44.39691,0],[-122.4466,44.39691,0],[-122.4466,44.39691,0],[-122.44591,44.39706,0],[-122.44501,44.39733,0],[-122.43857,44.39972,0],[-122.43786,44.39993,0],[-122.43678,44.40012,0],[-122.43678,44.40012,0],[-122.43678,44.40012,0],[-122.43671,44.40046,0],[-122.43652,44.400623,0],[-122.43652,44.400623,0],[-122.43593,44.40114,0],[-122.43593,44.40114,0],[-122.43566,44.40142,0],[-122.43566,44.40142,0],[-122.435425,44.40172,0],[-122.43537,44.40171,0]]},"properties":{"name":"Shuttle","stroke":"#000000"}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[[-122.4397,44.4008,0]]},"properties":{"name":"Gorge Begins"}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[[-122.48099,44.398952,0]]},"properties":{"name":"Lower Parking"}},{"properties":{"name":"Upper Parking"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[[-122.4354,44.402,0]]},"type":"Feature"},{"properties":{"name":"Wolf Creek slot"},"geometry":{"coordinates":[[-122.4636,44.3962,0]],"type":"Point"},"type":"Feature"}]},"rappelLongestMeters":null,"url":"https:\/\/ropewiki.com\/South_Santiam_River","longitude":-122.4811,"vehicle":"Passenger","rappelCountMax":0,"id":2265,"timeRating":"II","permit":"No","waterRating":"C","technicalRating":2,"months":["Jul","Aug","Sep"],"riskRating":null,"quality":3.7,"rappelCountMin":0,"name":"South Santiam River","latitude":44.3986}
