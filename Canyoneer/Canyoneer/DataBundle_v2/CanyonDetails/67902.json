  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>Short canyon between Chamonix and Martigny. Do not go in there in\nSummer, there is a huge water capture that can open anytime (also in\nAutumn, but once it gets cold the risks are not as high anymore).</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>From the parking walk along the road to Trient, until you feel that\nit's not too steep anymore to get down. If too exposed, after 1km you'll\nget to a bridge where you can reach the riverbed easily and walk back\n1km.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>A deep gorge, but also wide, with some nice rappels in the water,\nincluding a short obscuro underneith some huge boulders (no need for\nheadlamp though). Not many escapes, maybe it is possible to reach the\ntouristic path just before abseiling into the boulders.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>At the end you'll arrive at another hiking path which you can walk up\nfor 45min to get back to the car.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<p>Picture Credit : Alex Arnold</p>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n<p>Some very old anchors and some newer ones. Apparently long time ago,\nguides were doing this trip with tourist before they realised that it is\ntoo dangerous to do it in summer because of the water capture.</p>\n",
