It was referred to as Newnes Canyon by Tim Hager in 1977 (The\nWaysider 147 May/June 1977). The canyon was probably discovered by an\nSUBW party of Helen Whitfield, Karl Robertson, Dave Beattie and Gerry\nO'Byrne in 1963 (Report, the canyon they abseiled into, but don't\nmention much about: <a\nhref=\"https://www.subw.org.au/archives/press-on-regardless/newnes-glen-davis-return/\">https://www.subw.org.au/archives/press-on-regardless/newnes-glen-davis-return/</a>).\nThis report contains a sketch of the canyon formation just below the\ntunnel (near where they abseiled in).</p>\n<p>A much later SUBW party (John Atkinson, Bob Sault, Airdrie Long) were\npossible the first party to explore (from below) the tunnel section.\nThey returned on a later trip and abseiled into the tunnel.
