It was referred to as Newnes Canyon by Tim Hager in 1977 (The Waysider 147 May\/June 1977). The canyon was probably discovered by an SUBW party of Helen Whitfield, Karl Robertson, Dave Beattie and Gerry O'Byrne in 1963 (Report, the canyon they abseiled into, but don't mention much about: <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external free\" href=\"https:\/\/www.subw.org.au\/archives\/press-on-regardless\/newnes-glen-davis-return\/\">https:\/\/www.subw.org.au\/archives\/press-on-regardless\/newnes-glen-davis-return\/<\/a>). This report contains a sketch of the canyon formation just below the tunnel (near where they abseiled in). \n<\/p><p>A much later SUBW party (John Atkinson, Bob Sault, Airdrie Long) were possible the first party to explore (from below) the tunnel section.
