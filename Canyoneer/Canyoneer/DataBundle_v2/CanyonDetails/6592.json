Not really a\ndestination on it's own but an option for cutting some fire road hiking\nwhen accessing any of the canyons on the North side of Big Tujunga\nCreek: <a href=\"Great_Falls_of_the_Fox\" title=\"wikilink\">Great Falls of\nthe Fox</a>, <a href=\"Fall_Creek\" title=\"wikilink\">Fall Creek</a>, <a\nhref=\"Toypurina_Canyon\" title=\"wikilink\">Toypurina Canyon</a>, <a\nhref=\"Little_Fox_Creek\" title=\"wikilink\">Little Fox Creek</a>, <a\nhref=\"Fall_Creek_(Upper)\" title=\"wikilink\">Fall Creek (Upper)</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>The drainage is fairly steep and somewhat loose at the top. There is\na game trail on the ridge RDC. Follow this until the first real easy\nplace to enter the drainage on your left.</p>\n<p>Shortly after entering the drainage and some light bushwhacking you\nwill arrive at the top of the rappel. There is a short 6-8' down-climb\nsome may need assistance with.</p>\n<p>Rappel 1: 185' anchored off a tree LDC.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>At the bottom of this rappel turn left and head downstream in Big\nTujunga Creek. After about 10 minutes you will arrive at an old cement\nbridge where the fire road used to cross the creek. Take a right and\ncontinue up the fire road to your next canyon. If you want to hike back\nto your shuttle vehicle go left at the bridge (LDC).</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n<p>First known descent on Nov 16, 2014 by Alden Anderson and Mika\nEnriquez.</p>\n",
