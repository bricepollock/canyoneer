The first section is mostly lateral, easy stemming, with several easy downclimbs. High stemming is available to those who wish to practice. Some \"R\" silo crossings high may be found. The first section may take 1.5 - 2 hours. The 2nd section involves rappels in and out of wet potholes, semi-keeper potholes, one after another. Distance-wise, the second section is only about 500 feet in distance, but due to the rappels, may take 1 - 2 hours.\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>The first rappel is off a deadman anchor and is 75' in 2-stages. The pothole at the bottom of the first stage is likely filled with water of an unknown depth. It is easily avoided by going right into the crack. The crack can be easily down-climbed and is followed by a 20 foot rappel to the bottom. The pull is best done over the top of the knob that is skirted around by going down the crack on rappel. A couple down-climbs and semi-keeper potholes later the 2nd rappel is encountered and is 30' off a horn on the left. The landing is into a pothole with water of an unknown depth. The exit may require a partner assist, or pack toss. \nThere are two options to do the final technical section. There is a by-pass on the right to go directly to the final rappel. The full route involves staying in the drainage and going into and out of 5 or 5 potholes. Controlled slide into one, partner assist, easy donwclimbs. \nThe final rappel is anchored high on the right around a horn with 30' of webbing that makes for a 75' rappel with 20' of free hang at the bottom.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>A 10 minute hike down the wash is the confluence with Shenanigans. Another 20 minutes hike in the wash the Fooling Around canyon drainage comes in from the left. Just 5 minutes after the Fooling Around confluence is a round Cottonwood in the middle of the drainage. Head straight up the right bank on a use trail to get to the cross joint that is the exit. The bottom of No Kidding is on the right. 2\/3 of the way up there is an option to go right at a cairn to avoid the final Class 4 move. Going straight up requires a Class 4 move near the top. Once at the rim, the exit vehicle is visible if parked on the dirt road.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Red_tape\">Red tape<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Beta_sites\">Beta sites<\/h2><\/div>\n<ul><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http:\/\/roadtripryan.com\/go\/t\/utah\/north-wash\/monkeybusiness\">RoadTripRyan.com<\/a> &#160;: Monkey Business<\/li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http:\/\/canyoncollective.com\/betabase\/monkey-business.20\">CanyonCollective.com<\/a> &#160;: Monkey Business<\/li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http:\/\/ropewiki.com\/User:Super_Amazing_Map?id=Monkey_Business_Slot_-_North_Wash\">Super Amazing Map<\/a> &#160;: Monkey Business Slot<\/li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http:\/\/summitpost.org\/monkey-business-slot\/844352\">SummitPost.org<\/a> &#160;: Monkey Business Slot<\/li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https:\/\/bluugnome.com\/cyn_route\/north-wash\/north-wash_monkey-business\/north-wash_monkey-business.aspx\">bluugnome.com<\/a> &#160;: Monkey Business<\/li><\/ul>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media<\/h2><\/div>\n<ul><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http:\/\/candition.com\/canyons\/monkey-business-west-west-butler\">Candition.com<\/a>&#160;: Monkey Business - West&#160;; West Butler<\/li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external free\" href=\"http:\/\/www.bogley.com\/forum\/showthread.php?76892-Monkey-Business-04-30-2017\">http:\/\/www.bogley.com\/forum\/showthread.php?76892-Monkey-Business-04-30-2017<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/4giN19EeDL4\">YouTube.com<\/a>&#160;: Richard Pattison, Monkey Business movie<\/li><\/ul>\n<p><br \/>\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Background\">Background<\/h2><\/div>\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nParsed by mw‐api‐ext.codfw.main‐6779cc57fc‐dvkjz\nCached time: 20240914191945\nCache expiry: 2592000\nReduced expiry: false\nComplications: [show‐toc]\nCPU time usage: 0.006 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.007 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 21\/1000000\nPost‐expand include size: 0\/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 0\/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 2\/100\nExpensive parser function count: 0\/500\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0\/20\nUnstrip post‐expand size: 0\/5000000 bytes\nNumber of Wikibase entities loaded: 0\/400\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%    0.000      1 -total\n-->\n<\/div>","longitude":-110.4997,"latitude":38.0567,"url":"https:\/\/ropewiki.com\/Monkey_Business","technicalRating":3,"vehicle":"4WD"}
