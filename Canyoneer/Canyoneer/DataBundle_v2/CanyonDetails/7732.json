  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>A vertical drop into a beautiful cave with many large and finned\nstalagmites, stalactites and other features. Quarter sized big eared\nbats. Actively forming cave features that are drippy and wet.</p>\n<p>Please be gentle with this place, the unrestricted access to this\nwide cave is a rarity in the USA.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>Driving here is a little weird. RoadTripRyan's description pretty\nconfusing and GPS gets you near but doesn't tell you correctly which\nroads to take once leaving the free way.</p>\n<p>Directions are as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Leave Highway 318 and turn East onto Shingle Pass Road. (38.520859,\n-115.024956)</li>\n<li>Pass several right turns and fences until the road curves right and\ntake a sharp right (38.534723, -114.966196)</li>\n<li>The road will wind back and go along the culvert unit it turns left\nan become a straight line (38.526609, -114.981474)</li>\n<li>Take a left the the T-intersection and drive up towards Whipple Cave\n(38.516252, -114.976886)</li>\n<li>Park by the Whipple Cave interpretive signs or the 30m up the\nhill.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You need at least an standard SUV level clearance. The roads were\nrutted and had many hidden rocks.</p>\n<p>From parking the car its a 50m walk down a clear trail to a cave with\ntwo openings separated by a rock bridge.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>There is one pair of bolts near the lower cave entrance and two more\nsets further back. It seems large groups must come through here.</p>\n<p>It is one rappel about 20m to the ground.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>Fix the line on the descent so you can ascend / jug / jumar your way\nout of the cave on your line.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a\nhref=\"http://www.birdandhike.com/Hike/Other_Areas/Whipple/_Whipple.htm\">Bird&amp;Hike</a></li>\n<li><a\nhref=\"http://www.bricepollock.com/weird-adventures-at-whipple-cave/\">Brice\nPollock Blog</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n"
