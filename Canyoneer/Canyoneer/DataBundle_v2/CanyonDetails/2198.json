  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>Catherine Creek is located about five miles east of Bingen, WA. While\nthe creek itself is not a major canyoneering objective <a\nhref=\"http://ropewiki.com/Catherine_Creek_(Upper)\">(see Catherine Creek,\nUpper)</a>, the area is notable for a giant free-standing basalt arch\nlocated on the east wall of the canyon. Immediately south of the arch\nare two narrow slots. Objective hazards: loose rock, poison oak, and\nbarbed wire.</p>\n<p>Apart from the aforementioned hazards, the slots might be a nice\nplace to practice. Possibly be a good destination for rainy winter days\nwhen other creeks are running high. Visiting early or late season to\navoid the poison oak. It is often sunny out here when it's raining in\nPortland.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>From the parking pullout, walk east down the paved road for about\n0.2mi. Upon crossing Catherine Creek, look on the north side of the road\nto find a cairn and an unsigned hiking trail leading upwards. Follow\nthis path north/northwest, paralleling the top of the scarp until you\nlocate the wooden fence that bars access to the top of the Catherine\nCreek Arch. The top of the north slot is about 200ft south of the arch.\nLooking in from above, itâ€™s easily recognized by a large chockstone near\nat the top. The slot descends in a southerly direction.</p>\n<p>The south slot is another two hundred feet or so further south along\nthe rim. This one is as obvious from above, but is marked by several\nsmall trees inside a healthy thicket of poison oak. This slot descends\nin a northerly direction.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>North Slot: 70ft from chockstone. Low angle through poison oak and\nbarbed wire (old fence) to reach 25ft vertical section. Push through\nbushes &amp; poison oak to exit. (In random trivia: an escaped domestic\ngoat was once encountered in this slot. Apparently, they can eat poison\noak without harm; who knew?)</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Slouth Slot: 90ft from tree surrounded by by poison oak. Slot is\ntight, narrowing up to ~1ft across and may require a brief abandonment\nof dignity to squeeze through. Post-squeeze, the chasm widens and become\neasier. Beware loose rock.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>The easiest way to get back the top of the scarp is to follow the\nhiking trail north. Continue past the Catherine Creek Arch and head\nnortheast into a lesser side canyon. The trail is obvious and gradually\nclimbs up atop the cliffs. Total distance is about 0.5mi one-way; gain\n200ft. Follow the trail back south to locate the fence parking the top\nof the arch.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Or follow the trail from the arch south back to the trailhead.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<p>NW Forest Pass required at the trailhead.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately the Catherine Creek Arch itself has been closed /\nfenced off by the Forest Service as a sacred site to local Native\nAmerican tribes. Please respect the closure. Historically one could\nfollow a user trail up the talus field to a point directly beneath the\narch. Once underneath the arch, two additional slots become visible: one\nto the north and one to the south. Both slots provided a quick\nnon-technical scramble route back to the top.</p>\n<p>Closure order: <a\nhref=\"http://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/stelprdb5352797.pdf\">http://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/stelprdb5352797.pdf</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><img src=\"rwl_en.png\" title=\"rwl_en.png\" alt=\"rwl_en.png\" /><a\nhref=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20210527212206/www.canyoneeringnorthwest.com/CatherineCreek/Catherine_Creek.php\">CanyoneeringNorthwest.com\n(archive.org)</a> : Catherine Creek and Arch</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n",
