On the south side of the road, walk westwards uphill (away from Claustral) to the start of a section of roadside steel \"Armco\" crash barrier. Using the GPX track from this page: head south-south west to find a spur, and follow the spur down. Avoid the drainage lines. Just above the river, find a gap in the cliffline to enter.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading3\"><h3 id=\"Ranon_Brook\">Ranon Brook<\/h3><\/div>\n<p>If entering via Ranon Brook, the easiest option is to arrange a short car shuffle. Park one vehicle at the Claustral car park (as above) then drive west approximately 2km to a small parking area on your left, just past the 888 high point. If you only have one vehicle you will need to walk this section. Use the GPX route available to download above (hint: \"Download KML \/ GPX links under the map). The foot pad (i.e. obscure path) that used to exist is effectively gone after bushfire regrowth. Following the GPX will help establish the track. Some 100m before entering the river while still on the poorly defined spur, be wary of a hidden cliff line. Keep right to work around it.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading3\"><h3 id=\"Canyon_topo\">Canyon
