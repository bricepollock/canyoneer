  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>Canyon that has been done long time ago. Reequiped the upper part in\n2021, lower part, made of open waterfalls, is still of more a\n\"adventure\" kind of canyon. With 80m of rope (exact length still has to\nbe verified) you can rappel directly from the bridge.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>Whether you go by foot or by car, you should first aim the big bridge\nof the main road to Mund, above the start of the canyon. From there you\ncan walk down on a steep slope on the eastern side, or do a freehanging\n80m rappel from the middle of the bridge. Then there is some 200m\nwalking before encountering the first anchor.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>After a first narrow part of roughly 6 smaller waterfalls (up to 12m)\nit is possible to escape the canyon through an old \"Suone\" (water\ncapture), some rappels later there is another one, just before entering\nthe second narrow section, which has about the same length as the first\none. Once the crag opens up, the difficulty of the canyon increases as\nthe waterfall get bigger. It is possible to exit the canyon at this\npoint. In the waterfall below the train bridge, there is a hanging pool\nwhich is tricky to get through.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>The last boulders have not been equiped as there is nothing\ninteresting to abseil, so take the steps next to the water pipes on the\nright to get out of the waterstream. The canyon ends nearby the parking,\nyou just need to cross the Rhone river.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><img src=\"rwl_it.png\" title=\"rwl_it.png\" alt=\"rwl_it.png\" /><a\nhref=\"http://swisscanyon.ch/canyons/lista-ch-west.htm?Mundbach\">SwissCanyon.ch</a>\n: Mundbach</li>\n<li><img src=\"rwl_fr.png\" title=\"rwl_fr.png\" alt=\"rwl_fr.png\" /><a\nhref=\"http://swestcanyon.ch/Canyons/Mundbach/Mundbach.htm\">SwestCanyon.ch</a>\n: Mundbach</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n",
