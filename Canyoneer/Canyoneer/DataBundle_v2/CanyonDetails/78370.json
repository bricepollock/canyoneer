James Andrus Co., U.S. Cavalry.</p>\n<p>Excerpts from Advised Them to Call the Place Escalante by Jerry C.\nRoundy, pp 28-9 and 34, which can be found at Escalante Outfitters:</p>\n<p>While crossing a deep gorge and climbing up a steep ledge of rocks\nthe party was waylaid by Indians. The entire party had dismounted and\nwere leading their horses up a steep acclivity, with Elijah Averett\n[Everett] in the lead, when Indians attacked. Elijah was killed in the\nfirst fireâ€¦The next morning at 10:00 am they recovered the body of\nAverett [Everett] and buried him on the spot.</p>\n<p>Sometime later a round stone with \"E.A. 1866\" was placed on the\ngrave. About 1929 a more elaborate monument was erected at the lonely\nspot, but on this monument his name is spelled Everett instead of\nAverett. Everett's name had no doubt been mis-written on the military\nroster and was perpetuated in Wooley's report. Wooley consistently\nrefers to him as Averett. The canyon where he died now bears his\nname.</p>\n"
