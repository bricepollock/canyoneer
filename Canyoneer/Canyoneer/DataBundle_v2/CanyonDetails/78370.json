James Andrus Co., U.S. Cavalry.\n<\/p><p>Excerpts from Advised Them to Call the Place Escalante by Jerry C. Roundy, pp 28-9 and 34, which can be found at Escalante Outfitters:\n<\/p><p><br \/> \n<\/p><p>While crossing a deep gorge and climbing up a steep ledge of rocks the party was waylaid by Indians. The entire party had dismounted and were leading their horses up a steep acclivity, with Elijah Averett [Everett] in the lead, when Indians attacked. Elijah was killed in the first fireâ€¦The next morning at 10:00 am they recovered the body of Averett [Everett] and buried him on the spot.\n<\/p><p><br \/> \n<\/p><p>Sometime later a round stone with \"E.A. 1866\" was placed on the grave. About 1929 a more elaborate monument was erected at the lonely spot, but on this monument his name is spelled Everett instead of Averett. Everett's name had no doubt been mis-written on the military roster and was perpetuated in Wooley's report. Wooley consistently refers to him as Averett. The canyon where he died now bears his name.\n<\/p>\n\n\n<\/div>","rappelCountMin":2,"id":78370,"quality":2,"timeRating":"I","technicalRating":3,"url":"https:\/\/ropewiki.com\/Averett_Canyon","rappelLongestMeters":null,"shuttleSeconds":null,"latitude":37.4832,"months":[],"waterRating":"A","permit":"No","vehicle":null,"longitude":-112.0793,"riskRating":null,"name":"Averett Canyon","geojson":null,"rappelCountMax":2,"version":"31997b0c38c0a184daa9b93e653a5970c7394684f1fbefb2b3bbdbd1fafbdc38"}
