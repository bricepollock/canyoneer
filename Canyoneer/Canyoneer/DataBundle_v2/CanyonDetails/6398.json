  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>A nice short technical creek in the Wynoochee Valley on the south\nside of the Olympics. The creek exits into the East Fork Humptulips\nRiver and one can have the fun experience of drifting through a lovely\nnarrows most of the way back to the exit bridge.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Goforth Creek is easily combined with other destinations in the\nWynoochee Valley. It's possible to visit 2-3 of them in a single\nday.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Have your flotation dialed for the river float.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>The lower parking area is the bridge crossing the East Fork\nHumptulips River along FR 22. From here, hike or shuttle 0.1mi southwest\nthen turn off on FR 2206. Follow for 1.6mi until it crosses Goforth\nCreek in a culvert. There's a pullout just past the culvert on the right\nwith room for several vehicles.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The checkpoint is the East Fork Humptulips River from the bridge. Be\nsure it's running at a comfortable level for you before running\nGoforth.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<h3 id=\"goforth_creek\">Goforth Creek</h3>\n<p>Drop into Goforth Creek on the upstream side of the road. Make your\nway through the giant culvert. The adventure begins with a shallow jump\nout of the culvert into a deep pool. Head downstream. As of 2023 there\nwere a few log jams that are easily bypassed.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>R1: 20ft. Creek divides around a large rocky monolith with most of\nthe flow going DCL. Anchor options: 1) Scramble over the large jam DCL\nto drop down into a small pool then rappel out of the flow from a tree\nDCL. There are no good options for log anchors in this area as of 2023.\n2) Rappel from any convenient log in the logjam, or 3) climb up over a\ngiant log to a tree on the DCR side of the monolith. The latter is\ntrickier to reach. For extra bonus points, rappel down into a hidden\npothole and scramble out through a natural arch back into the\nwatercourse. (The rappel from the tree will drop you straight into it.)\nDownclimb a short step at the base of the falls.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>15ft drop behind a logjam. Downclimb DCR behind a giant boulder or\nrappel from a log in the center of the jam.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>R2: 15ft from log DCL. There is a chamber/room at the bottom of the\nrappel that is blocked by several vertical logs. In higher flow this is\nlikely a strainer/entrapment hazard.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>R3: 35ft from log DCR into the East Fork Humptulips River. As of\n2023 there is a anchor with a long extension from a suspended log. This\nprovides an excellent pull but will likely need to be replaced by the\nnext team as the webbing is aging. A long length of webbing (20 + ft)\nwill be needed to reset this. The rappel is completely out of the\nflow.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"humptulips_river\">Humptulips River</h3>\n<p>Upon rappelling into the river, the water flow level will quadruple\nif not more. Be ready for it. If the Humptulips River is running high,\nit might be possible to skip R3 and exit DCR up to the road. This option\nhas not been explored and could be a mighty bushwhack.</p>\n<p>Hike / wade / float / swim your way downstream through some nice\nsections of narrows. If the flow is good, you may be able to float your\nway most of the way back to the bridge. Beware places in the narrows\nwhere it narrows up as the speed of the water will increase. There are\nseveral places you can get out to bypass various rapids. Also beware\nstrainers and foot entrapment in high flow. Keep going until you reach\nthe bridge on FR 22.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>Exit is a dirty grovel up a steep eroded chute DCR under the bridge.\nThere might be a better exit just downstream on either side of the\nriver, but this option has not yet been explored.</p>\n<p>There is also the option to exit DCR at any flattish area in sight of\nthe bridge to reach FR 2206 then hike back to the parking area.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<p>None.</p>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><img src=\"rwl_en.png\" title=\"rwl_en.png\" alt=\"rwl_en.png\" /><a\nhref=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20210527212206/www.canyoneeringnorthwest.com/GoForth/Goforth_Creek.php\">CanyoneeringNorthwest.com\n(archive.org)</a> : Goforth Creek</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n",
