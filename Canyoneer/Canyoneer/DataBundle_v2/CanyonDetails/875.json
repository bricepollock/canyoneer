beautiful and difficult overnight canyoneering and packrafting trip in the Marble Canyon area of the Grand Canyon.  Unique to Tatahatso Wash are the very scenic Redwall narrows, a long, beautiful stretch of packrafting and relative ease of access due to the canyons location on the south rim not terribly far from the highway compared to many other of the big Grand Canyon trips.  While the hiking is mostly steep, difficult and tedious, the distances covered are relatively short mileage-wise; making this canyon trip slightly more approachable as far as the big Grand Canyon trips go.
