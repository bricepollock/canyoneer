  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>This is a tourist attraction created around a very beautiful canyon.\nIt is named for a natural travertine bridge located\n<span class=\"umi-ex notranslate\">1mi</span> upstream from the parking\narea that forms a tunnel that the wide stream flows through, which has\nmultiple 'Matacanes' style showerheads with flowing water inside the\ntunnel. The path is well developed, with many low wooden bridges\ncrossing the stream, and in one section an elevated concrete walkway\nbuilt to skirt deep (jumpable) pools between the canyon walls (visible\nin the cover photo).</p>\n<p>There are many shops and small restaurants located around the\nmultiple parking areas.</p>\n<p>You will exit down through this area after doing the lower section of\nLa Barranca canyon.</p>\n<p>Cost in Feb 2022 was 120 pesos per person, charged even for walking\ndown through it after doing the canyon (they will wait for you and catch\nyou). Parking was 70 pesos per vehicle.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<p>Felix: \"I visited the punto twice, each time from the canyons\nupstream. If accessing from the bottom, you will start in the community\nof??. There are some small shops there, camping for 50 Pecos, and at\nleast one expensive hotel (500 Pecos). The people I talked to said that\naccess to Puente de Dios was 150 Pecos, pero, this is for a group of up\nto 5. So try and form a group.\"</p>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n",
