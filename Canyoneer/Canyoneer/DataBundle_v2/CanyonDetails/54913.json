It is named for a natural travertine bridge located <span class=\"umi-ex notranslate\">1mi<\/span> upstream from the parking area that forms a tunnel that the wide stream flows through, which has multiple 'Matacanes' style showerheads with flowing water inside the tunnel. The path is well developed, with many low wooden bridges crossing the stream, and in one section an elevated concrete walkway built to skirt deep (jumpable) pools between the canyon walls (visible in the cover photo).\n<\/p><p>There are many shops and small restaurants located around the multiple parking areas.\n<\/p><p>You will exit down through this area after doing the lower section of La Barranca canyon.\n<\/p><p>Cost in Feb 2022 was 120 pesos per person, charged even for walking down through it after doing the canyon (they will wait for you and catch you). Parking was 70 pesos per vehicle.\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Red_tape\">Red tape<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Felix: \"I visited the punto twice, each time from the canyons upstream. If accessing from the bottom, you will start in the community of??. There are some small shops there, camping for 50 Pecos, and at least one expensive hotel (500 Pecos). The people I talked to said that access to Puente de Dios was 150 Pecos, pero, this is for a group of up to 5.
