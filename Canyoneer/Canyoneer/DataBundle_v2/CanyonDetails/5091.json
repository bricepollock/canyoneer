  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>This section of Ten Mile Creek, extends from near Highway 180 down to\nthe Kings River. The 2 mile Yucca Point trail leads back up to the road\nfrom the river. The Boyden Cavern company leads commercial canyoneering\ntrips in this section. I assume that they set quite a few rappels, but\nthere are only about 2 mandatory rappels for skilled downclimbers. I was\nsurprised by how many fairly large falls had interesting and reasonable\ndownclimbs. I think this lower section is a little bit less interesting\nthat the upper section from Hume to Highway 180, but certainly worth\ndoing and very fun.</p>\n<p>While there are not a ton of mandatory rappels, there are some\noptional ones that could be quite a bit more fun than climbing around. A\nfew well placed bolts would help facilitate this, as there are\nsurprisingly few fixed anchors from the Boyden Cave folks. Also, while\nthe lower section proves a bit less technical than the upper part, there\nare more in the way of fun slides, jumps, and a cool stemming section\nnear the bottom.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>From Fresno area drive up Highway 180 through the Grants Grove\nsection of Kings Canyon National Park. Pay the entrance fee. Drive\ntowards Kings Canyon. You will cross Ten Mile Creek at a small private\nresort called Kings Canyon Lodge. Continue past a few hundred yards and\nlook for turnouts on the left above the creek. There are several to\nchoose from, so inspect to see which descent looks most appealing.</p>\n<p>I marked 3 entry points. The first one starts right next to the road\ngets you a fun little slide to jump move that is a bit bumpy, and\nsomething you have to have an eye for, and a bit of boulder hopping. The\nsecond is more of a scramble down, and comes in above a short gorge that\ncan be jumped into, with mostly a low angle scenic bedrock section\nbelow. The 3rd comes in just above where the canyon gets optionally\ntechnical.</p>\n<p>The Yucca Point Trailhead is 1/2 to 3/4 of a mile away depending on\nwhich turnout is used.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>Just below the lower drop-in is a fun sliding rappel of ~140 feet. A\ngood bit of boulder hopping follows until you get to ~100 foot drop into\na scenic gorge that is bolted from a ledge on the right, and you made be\nable to disconnect 15-20 feet above the water and slide the rest of the\nway in.</p>\n<p>The canyon gets steep below here and drops into a series of larger\nwaterfalls. Most of this can be downclimbed around, or bypassed with\nrappels on the side. Though it would be a bit \"contrived\", a descent\nthrough the watercourse would be more fun, though some fresh bolts would\nprobably be needed. There's a single bolt in there, but for some reason\ntwo rusty rapids jammed are jammed into it making it quite useless.</p>\n<p>The final of these large falls is a sliding one that is easily\nbypassed down a ramp on the left. Staying to the right of the creek\nbelow here will go past a small path that exits up to the Yucca Point\nTrail on the right, if you feel like exiting.</p>\n<p>Continuing down brings you to one of the more exciting sections of\nLower Tenmile, a narrow gorge that leads to some stemming. There's a set\nof double bolts at the top of the stemming section, which could be used\nto descend the ~8 foot drop at the end of it, though sticking a rope in\nthe crack is a real possibility. Unfortunately the bottom of the 8 foot\ndrop is overall shallow and filled with boulders. A sketchy shallow jump\nis possible by sending someone down first on rope to carefully scout the\nlanding.</p>\n<p>Below here is a waterfall that can be bypassed, although rappelling\ninto the middle and sliding down the bottom half is quite fun. A final\nslide waits below.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>The route ends in a jumble of rocks. Exit canyon right(Middle Fork\nKings river upstream) about as soon as you clear the canyon. There is a\nshort section of rapids on the Middle Fork canyon left. You will find a\nuse trail leading upstream above the river. If you don't find the trail,\nit is still fairly easy hiking along the edge of the river. At the\nconfluence of the south and middle forks of the Kings river, you will\nfind the bottom of the Yucca Point Trail at least 30 yards upstream of\nthe confluence. The YP trail ends on a rock. This trail switchbacks\nabout 2 miles up to the highway. It could be slightly overgrown with\npoison oak or other vegetation. At the highway it is 1/2 to 3/4 of a\nmile to the turnouts where you started into the creek.</p>\n<p>There is also trail access halfway down the creek. A spur trail leads\nfrom the Yucca Point trail to the creek, downstream of Ten Mile Falls.\nThere are some signs of human travel attempts just below Ten Mile\nFalls(non-rappel waterfall with sizable shallowish pool). Ignore those\nand continue down canyon out of view until you see the trail access\ncanyon right. This allows you to do just the upper half if you are going\nslow or do not want to do the whole section. Or you could hike down and\njust do the lower half. The Boyden Cave company divides their trips up\nin just this fashion.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<p>This creek is in Sequoia National Forest next to Kings Canyon\nNational Park. The drive in goes through the Kings Canyon Park entrance\nstation. You must pay a fee or have a National Parks Pass.</p>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n<p>Trevor Haggenson and I did this trip sometime in the late 1990's or\nearly 2000's. We mostly downclimbed drops, but rappelled a couple times\nI think. We could have downclimbed one of those at least, but poison oak\npersuaded us to rappel. I talked to Steve Fairchild at Boyden Cave and\nhe started commercial canyoneering trips in here the year or so later.\n(PM 2014)</p>\n<p>A memorial for Luca Chiarabini has been established close to the\nconfluence of Tenmile Creek and the Kings River. A giant Sequoia sapling\nhas been planted DCL close to the rock wall after the last pool\n(36.83880, -118.87958). Luca Chiarabini passed away on August 3, 2017\nwhile attempting to cross the King Rivers after completing a first\ndescent of a nearby canyon, Deer Creek.
