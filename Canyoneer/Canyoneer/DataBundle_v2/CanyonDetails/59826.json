  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>A nice tributary feeding into Quartzville Creek / Green Peter Lake,\nnortheast of Sweet Home, OR. This canyon has some fun rappels and some\ninteresting sections. There is quite a bit of creek walking (0.6mi)\nbefore you get to the technical section. Once it starts, it's non-stop\naction all the way to the bottom. Best in the spring when it has good\nwater. If you're looking for water, don't bother after late June. There\nare no swimmers on the creek. Deepest pool is about waist-deep.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It's possible to do a \"shortcut\" approach directly from the road\ndown to the top of the technical section. This is much shorter at\n0.25mi, but it's quite steep with a lot of bushwhacking through old\npiles of clear cut slash which really slows things down. Hiking in via\nthe creek might actually be faster.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Watershed: 1mi^2.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>From Green Peter Dam, head generally northeast on the winding Quartz\nCreek Rd for ~12mi. Watch for a water gage station and a big sign just\nbefore the creek. There is a good pullout for parking at the gage\nstation with room for 5-6 cars. Just past Panther Creek (left) is\nanother pullout (right) which is also a campsite.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The checkpoint is the view of Panther Creek right from the road. The\nlast rappel is visible.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"shuttle\">Shuttle</h2>\n<p>Backtrack south on Quartzville Rd for 0.7mi and take the first right\non Trout Creek Rd. Gate at the bottom was open in June 2020. Follow it\nup, staying on the main road at all junctions for ~3mi to where the road\ncrosses Panther Creek. Just before the creek is a large pullout with\nroom for 3-4 vehicles.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Road up is a bit steep in places and rough in places. A passenger\n2WD can make it if driven carefully.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>From the upper trailhead, walk to where the road crosses the creek\nand make your way down into the creek on the north side. It's a long-ish\nwalk before the action starts (~0.5mi). Expect the usual Pacific NW\ncreek walking, a little downclimbing and scrambling around obstacles.\nThere are one or two very short slides. (There may be a shortcut that\nleads right to the top of waterfall alley, but it looks pretty overgrown\nand steep. This route has not yet been explored.)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>10ft falls. Downclimb DCR.</li>\n<li>R1: 2-tier from small tree. While perhaps 50ft high, it requires\n~100ft of rope (SRT) to get down due to the horizontal distance.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A short distance ahead is <strong>Panther Creek Falls</strong>. This\nbeautiful waterfall is composed of three tiers (R2 &amp; R3). (In high\nwater, you can bypass R2 DCR along a vegetated shelf up to a tree. From\nthe tree to the bottom of R3 requires almost 200ft SRT of rope.)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>R2: 20ft. From a pinch under a giant boulder DCL. First tier of the\nfalls.</li>\n<li>R3: 180ft from two bolts DCL, down the second &amp; third tier. The\npull can be difficult; try to move back as far as you can. (It might be\nworth establishing another bolt station at the DCR lip of the third\ntier.)</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>R4: 45ft.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>R5: ~40ft. The creek plunges into a short slot. The exit is blocked\nby a rootball / fallen tree which could be a strainer in high flow.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Below, the creek enters an interesting \"mini-narrows\" with lots of\nshort drops. The sides are largely mossy exposed bedrock and\nwildflowers. It's possible to downclimb most of the drops, but not all.\nSome of the obstacles can be bypassed along the sides, but please try to\navoid trampling vegetation and scraping off the moss. Staying in the\nwater may be a challenge in higher flow and could be dangerous in some\nareas.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>R6: In the middle of the mini-narrows, the creek suddenly drops 20ft\ninto a short tight slot. Anchored on a thin tree atop a ledge DCL. The\nsecond tier of the falls below is easily downclimbed.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Continue through more bedrock areas below.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>R7: 20ft from a tree DCR.</li>\n<li>Cross an area of boulders from a landslide.</li>\n<li>R8: Last rappel down a chute to the road. Drop is maybe 30ft high\nbut at least 100ft of rope is required per the horizontal distance from\nthe tree anchor. (A single bolt would improve the anchor situation\nhere.) The last vertical is maybe 10ft high and can be a fast power\nslide into a shallow pool. The rope can be pulled from the road (tho'\nwatch out for passing cars).</li>\n</ul>\n<p></p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>Exit? What exit? Climb up to the road and walk to your car.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<p>It appears the upper area of Panther Creek may be on private logging\nland (the approach), but the waterfalls are all on public land below.\nThere is a gate at the bottom of Trout Creek Rd, but it was open in June\n2020. If not closed, you can probably drive on up without any issues.\nIt's not signed anywhere that you can't.</p>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n<p>First descent was made in June 2020 by Kevin Clark, Wade Hewitt, and\nWim Aarts.</p>\n",
