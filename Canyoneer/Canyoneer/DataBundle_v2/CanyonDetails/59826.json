into Quartzville Creek \/ Green Peter Lake, northeast of Sweet Home, OR. This canyon has some fun rappels and some interesting sections. There is quite a bit of creek walking (0.6mi) before you get to the technical section. Once it starts, it's non-stop action all the way to the bottom. Best in the spring when it has good water.  If you're looking for water, don't bother after late June.  There are no swimmers on the creek.  Deepest pool is about waist-deep.\n<\/p>\n<ul><li>It's possible to do a \"shortcut\" approach directly from the road down to the top of the technical section. This is much shorter at 0.25mi, but it's quite steep with a lot of bushwhacking through old piles of clear cut slash which really slows things down. Hiking in via the creek might actually be faster.<\/li><\/ul>\n<ul><li>Watershed: 1mi^2.<\/li><\/ul>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>From Green Peter Dam, head generally northeast on the winding Quartz Creek Rd for ~12mi.  Watch for a water gage station and a big sign just before the creek.  There is a good pullout for parking at the gage station with room for 5-6 cars.  Just past Panther Creek (left) is another pullout (right) which is also a campsite.\n<\/p>\n<ul><li>The checkpoint is the view of Panther Creek right from the road.

There are one or two very short slides. \n<\/p><p>(Once we tried a shortcut route, dropping from the road on the south side directly to the top of waterfall alley.
