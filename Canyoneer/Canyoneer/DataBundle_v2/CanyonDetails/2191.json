  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>A short tributary of Upper Fall Creek (Upper Fall Creek). Not a\ndestination in itself but if you are interested in checking out a seldom\nseen portion of Fall Creek this canyon is a good entrance to it.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>Same approach as Great Falls of the Fox Short Cut until you leave the\nroad.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>The first obstacle is a short downclimb to a small sandy area where\nthere is a bush anchor for rappel 1. The short (20 ft) downclimb can be\nrappelled from the top instead of being downclimbed if desired. However\nthere is poison oak in the pull/rappel lion DCR that I didn't\nparticularly want to play around in.</p>\n<p>R1: 65 feet anchored of a small bush DCL</p>\n<p>R2: 35? feet anchored to a bush DCL</p>\n<p>Short downclimb after rap 2 brings you to the top of rap 3. Multiple\nanchor possibilities which will affect length of rappel.</p>\n<p>R3: 40 feet anchored from a bush center canyon.</p>\n<p>Just a little further and you're at the junction with Upper Fall\nCreek.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>Continue down Upper Fall Creek. You can exit where the Fall Creek\nFire Road intersects the canyon (Pretty brushy and not well defined) or\njust continue on down Fall Creek until it meet's Big Tujunga, the more\nlikely option.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n<p>First doceumented descent by Alden Anderson</p>\n",
