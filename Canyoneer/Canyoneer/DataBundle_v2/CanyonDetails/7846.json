looked like the greens of a golf course.\n<\/p><p>Golf has been descended for more than a decade, by hundreds of people, using only natural anchors. Please, if you are planning on making a descent, know how to evaluate, construct, and manage natural anchors within a technical canyon. Golf is not \"throw and go\" where every anchor is always simple. Every potential descent needs to be prepared with the knowledge and equipment to evaluate and construct natural anchors. If you do not have these skills, please learn them beforehand in a controlled-safe environment hopefully from an experienced source, BEFORE going in Golf canyon. With the proper experience the anchors in Golf are not sketchy nor dangerous, and risks of using natural anchors can be can be effectively and safely managed.\n<\/p><p>This is not the place to pull out the drill and install bolts or other fixed anchors. They are absolutely not needed outside of a Land Manager sponsored SAR operations. If you cannot descend Golf without the use or installation of bolts, don't do it, and don't install them. Learn the skills to do so without, and come back later.\n<\/p><p>Golf Canyon is within the the Federally designated Paiute Wilderness Area.'<b> Please abide by the laws of Wilderness Areas.
