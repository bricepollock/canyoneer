Defiance.  There are two primary objectives here:\n<\/p><p><b>1) Hole-in-the-Wall Falls (3C I)<\/b>\nThis is a fun shortie outing you can knock out in an hour or so and visits one of the most interesting features of the creek: Hole-in-the-Wall Falls. This effectively a man-made waterfall and is quite the novelty.  In the early 1900's, the architects of the Columbia Gorge historic highway disliked how much spray was reaching the road, so diverted the entire creek to prevent damage. Today, Warren Creek reaches the top of the old falls, then is diverted through a man-made tunnel to plunge 100ft down a narrow slot. The old falls remains dry much of the year except in times of extreme flow. Running this section of Warren Creek could be combined with nearby Cabin Creek for a longer day.\n<\/p><p><b>2) Full Warren (3C IV)<\/b>\nWarren Creek originates from Warren Lake, high on Mt. Defiance. This longer route is described on a <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https:\/\/ropewiki.com\/Warren_Creek\">separate page<\/a>.\n<\/p><p>The creek's watershed includes Warren Lake on Mt. Defiance: 1.84mi^2.\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>From the parking lot, hike west on the bike trail which parallels the freeway. You will pass beneath Cabin Creek Falls and then a paved side trail leads to Hole-in-the-Wall Falls. This is a good place to assess the flow. From here, cross the bridge, and follow the trail up a few minutes to reach a trail junction. Bear left (going right will take you to the base of Lancaster Falls) and continue up until the trail rounds the nose of the ridge. Continuing following the trail back down to reach a bridge across Warren Creek. Head downstream 5min to the falls. Please do not shortcut the route in as this will lead to erosion and creation of user trails. Also: there's poison oak.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>You know you've arrived at the top of Hole-in-the-Wall Falls upon encountering the gigantic metal grating set up to keep the tunnel from getting clogged by vegetative debris and rocks.  The grating is angled to dump creek debris over the brink and down the old (now dry) Warren Falls. Water pours down between the slats into the tunnel below. Environmental engineering!  It's easy to climb down under the grating through an opening DCR.\n<\/p>\n<ul><li>R1 (down the tunnel): 140ft. Anchor on a tree just where you climb down under the grating. Rappel to a bolt station DCL set about 10ft back from the lower mouth of the tunnel (i.e. anchor for R2). There is a safe ledge after the drop from the tree, under the grate, prior to entering the tunnel. This ledge is an excellent place to station the team, with full view of the tunnel, while the first person descends. The tunnel is relatively low-angle, but it may be wise to treat this anchor as a rebelay. In high flow, you will need to stem across the last half of the tunnel in order to avoid being swept off your feet.  Be aware that communication inside the tunnel is nigh-impossible per the noise of the water.  Even whistle signals may not be heard. Be sure you make a plan and that your team understands it before entering the tunnel. A headlamp is not a bad idea in the tunnel, but may not be 100% necessary. (A headlamp could be used for signaling?)<\/li><\/ul>\n<ul><li>R2 (down the falls): 150ft from bolts DCL. They are positioned about 10ft back from the tunnel mouth. This makes it easier to get on rappel and ensures the anchor is out of view of any non-canyoneer tourists passing below. This is a two-tier falls (90ft &amp; 40ft) with a short hanging pool \/ horizontal section between them.\n<ul><li>There is another single bolt set in the century-old concrete DCR right outside the mouth of the tunnel; use is not recommended.<\/li>\n<li>Beware getting caught on moss-covered metal spike located at \"floor level\" DCL at the mouth of the tunnel. If not careful, it'd be relatively easy to get a harness or pack caught on it.<\/li>\n<li>Once at the bottom of the falls, it may be wise to climb back up to the platform DCL (i.e. top of the second tier) to pull your rope.  This requires a short scramble. Nice clean pull from the anchor.<\/li><\/ul><\/li><\/ul>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>From the bottom of the falls, hike back to the Starvation Creek trailhead.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Red_tape\">Red tape<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>The falls is fairly popular, so it's best to keep a low profile, make a good impression, and
