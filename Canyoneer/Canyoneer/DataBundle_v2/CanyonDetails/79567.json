  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>Warren Creek is a tributary of the Columbia River draining a large\narea of the north side of Mt. Defiance. There are two primary objectives\nhere:</p>\n<p><strong>1) Hole-in-the-Wall Falls (3C I)</strong> This is a fun\nshortie outing you can knock out in an hour or so and visits one of the\nmost interesting features of the creek: Hole-in-the-Wall Falls. This\neffectively a man-made waterfall. In the early 1900's, the architects of\nthe Columbia Gorge historic highway disliked how much spray was reaching\nthe road, so diverted the entire creek to prevent damage. Today, Warren\nCreek reaches the top of the old falls, then is diverted through a\nman-made tunnel to plunge 100ft down a narrow slot. The old falls\nremains dry much of the year except in times of extreme flow. Running\nthis section of Warren Creek could be combined with nearby Cabin Creek\nfor a longer day.</p>\n<p><strong>2) Full Warren (3C IV)</strong> Warren Creek originates from\nWarren Lake, high on Mt. Defiance. This longer route is described on a\n<a href=\"https://ropewiki.com/Warren_Creek\">separate page</a>.</p>\n<p>The creek's watershed includes Warren Lake on Mt. Defiance:\n1.84mi^2.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>From the parking lot, hike west on the bike trail which parallels the\nfreeway. You will pass beneath Cabin Creek Falls and then a paved side\ntrail leads to Hole-in-the-Wall Falls. This is a good place to assess\nthe flow. From here, cross the bridge, and follow the trail up a few\nminutes to reach a trail junction. Bear left (going right will take you\nto the base of Lancaster Falls) and continue up until the trail rounds\nthe nose of the ridge. Continuing following the trail back down to reach\na bridge across Warren Creek. Head downstream 5min to the falls. Please\ndo not shortcut the route in as this will lead to erosion and creation\nof user trails. Also: there's poison oak.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>You know you've arrived at the top of Hole-in-the-Wall Falls upon\nencountering the gigantic metal grating set up to keep the tunnel from\ngetting clogged by vegetative debris and rocks. The grating is angled to\ndump creek debris over the brink and down the old (now dry) Warren\nFalls. Water pours down between the slats into the tunnel below.\nEnvironmental engineering! It's easy to climb down under the grating\nthrough an opening DCR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>R1 (down the tunnel): 140ft. Anchor on a tree just where you climb\ndown under the grating. Rappel to a bolt station DCL set about 10ft back\nfrom the lower mouth of the tunnel (i.e. anchor for R2). There is a safe\nledge after the drop from the tree, under the grate, prior to entering\nthe tunnel. This ledge is an excellent place to station the team, with\nfull view of the tunnel, while the first person descends. The tunnel is\nrelatively low-angle, but it may be wise to treat this anchor as a\nrebelay. In high flow, you will need to stem across the last half of the\ntunnel in order to avoid being swept off your feet. Be aware that\ncommunication inside the tunnel is nigh-impossible per the noise of the\nwater. Even whistle signals may not be heard. Be sure you make a plan\nand that your team understands it before entering the tunnel. A headlamp\nis not a bad idea in the tunnel, but may not be 100% necessary. (A\nheadlamp could be used for signaling?)</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>R2 (down the falls): 150ft from bolts DCL. They are positioned about\n10ft back from the tunnel mouth. This makes it easier to get on rappel\nand ensures the anchor is out of view of any non-canyoneer tourists\npassing below. This is a two-tier falls (90ft &amp; 40ft) with a short\nhanging pool / horizontal section between them.\n<ul>\n<li>There is another single bolt set in the century-old concrete DCR\nright outside the mouth of the tunnel; it's hard to see until you're on\ntop of it. This bolt might be useful as a deviation in high flow?</li>\n<li>Beware getting caught on moss-covered metal spike located at \"floor\nlevel\" DCL at the mouth of the tunnel. If not careful, it'd be\nrelatively easy to get a harness or pack caught on it.</li>\n<li>Once at the bottom of the falls, it may be wise to climb back up to\nthe platform DCL (i.e. top of the second tier) to pull your rope. This\nrequires a short scramble. Nice clean pull from the anchor.</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>From the bottom of the falls, hike back to the Starvation Creek\ntrailhad.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<p>None.</p>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a\nhref=\"https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.10104002948241538&amp;type=1&amp;l=1381a88699\">March\n26, 2015 FB Album</a></li>\n<li><a\nhref=\"https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.10104125339164148&amp;type=1&amp;l=bf5ebc4ad9\">May\n1, 2016 FB Album</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<p>Warren Creek at Moderate-High flow<br />\n{{#ev:vimeo|127637976}}<br />\nWarren Creek at Low-Moderate flow<br />\n{{#ev:vimeo|142261967}}</p>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n",
