There is a 2-tier falls that must be stemmed down. The top falls are about 6 feet and form a hydraulic that will jettison you into a death siphon if any slip ups are made. On the right is a must-make rock you must get your right foot on. The rock is hardly visible as the flow is heaviest on the right where it pours off in a powerful laminar flow. There is also a ledge a foot or two below the water on the left. It is ideal to get a spotter here if possible. NOTE: IN BETWEEN THESE TWO ROCKS IS A SIPHON OVER 10 FEET DEEP THAT WILL NOT SPIT YOU OUT. Stemming past this point is also not advisable as the walls widen and several canyoneers have fallen down the next falls resulting in broken ankles. NOTE: IT IS NOT ADVISABLE TO STEM HIGH PAST THE SECOND TIER EITHER. This has also resulted in falls and broken ankles on the ledges underwater. Once you have your feet at the bottom of the first 6-foot tier, then it is relatively easy to stem and bridge over the next tier, which drops 15-feet into a channel with friendly hydraulics that will spit you out once you lower down into it. It is easy to stem in ledges that can't be seen but are just a foot under water. NOTE: THE CORRIDOR CAN BE AVOIDED BY CLIMBING UP ON CANYON RIGHT AND HIKING AROUND. The guide will be happy to guide anyone in your group who is not ready for a must-make death siphon.<\/li><\/ul>\n<link rel=\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\" href=\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1062633282\"> \n<div class=\"thumb tright\">\n<div style=\"display:table;\">\n<span class=\"mw-default-size\" typeof=\"mw:Error mw:File\/Frameless\">\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<ul><li><b>Continue:<\/b> It's about a 30 minute trail and creek walk with many scenic pools and chutes before you arrive at the final rappel. On the way there are cliff dwellings barely visible in the distance on canyon right. On a trip 3\/31\/18, in 12cfs water, we were able to rappel or stem another corridor between the chute and the final rappel.  It is DCL of a large boulder with a shady area underneath}. Normally people walk around or jump to get past the chute. However, we were able to rig an anchor and rappel it, but also to stem it off rope.<\/li><\/ul>\n<p><br \/>\n<\/p>\n<ul><li><b>R2\/Jump:<\/b> Bolts, canyon right, 50-feet. Recommended to leave rope at least 5 feet above the surface of the water as there are usually many people who hike up form the bottom to spend the day at this water hole and it would be dangerous if a swimmer were to tangle or hang from the rope. The rope can be pulled up to any height to make a jumping de-rig into the pool. The guide said people have jumped from the top and not touched bottom. Note: Our group on 3\/31\/18 in 12 cfs flow (low) was able to rig an anchor from some boulders far off to the side DCL, and rappel into the flow of the waterfall directly, entering from the top on the DCL side of the fall).<\/li><\/ul>\n<link rel=\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\" href=\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1062633282\"> \n<div class=\"thumb tright\">\n<div style=\"display:table;\">\n<span class=\"mw-default-size\" typeof=\"mw:Error mw:File\/Frameless\">\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Below the final rappel at Falls #1, there is a well-worn trail that involves several creek crossings.
