  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>In a region where canyons are pretty much not existent, the glaciers\nof the Piz Palü were able to carve a beautiful gorge into the hard rock\nof the Bernina mountains. It doesn't come as a surprise that this canyon\nhas a very big catchment area and is only doable due to a water\nreservoir.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>Use the Bernina Express (train) to get to Alp Grüm, for there it is a\nshort walk to the upper section, right underneith the Lagh da Palü.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>Some anchors are old and not easy to reach, but the canyon is very\nnicely carved, and continuous. Between the two section there is slightly\nmore than 1 km to walk though.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>The end is made of boulders, you will need to downclimb then until\nthe first hiking path crosses the river.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<p>Picture credit : Alex Arnold</p>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n",
