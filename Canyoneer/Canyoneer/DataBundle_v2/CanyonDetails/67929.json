  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>Another big valley that has bad rock that doesn't allow a nice\ncanyon. If you try it, better get out at the Train Bridge, afterwards\nthere are only blocks.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>Take the hiking path leading into the valley (on the western side).\nAt the first opportunity to cross the river, you can see the \"main\nsection\" from the bridge. But you'll need to stay on the same side and\nthen take the path that goes towards the next smaller bridge. There it\nis easy to reach the water.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>A few jumps to start off (not very deep), then around 3-4 technical\nrappels. And then just boulders, better find a way out if you don't want\nto spend your time downclimbing.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>If you stay in the riverbed, on top of the boulders you'll need to\ncross a construction area (at least in 2021). So it's definitely better\nto find a way back to the hiking path way up already.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n<p>First descent in november 2021.
