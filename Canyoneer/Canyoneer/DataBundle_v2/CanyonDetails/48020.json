Not a major objective by any means, but \/might\/ be an amusing diversion when other creeks are flowing at extreme levels. Little Perham had a major water release in 2016 (natural dam upstream giving way) that scoured the creek all the way down to the bedrock, but it wasn't nearly as interesting when we came back a year later. Do not expect greatness. This is a bottom-of-the-barrel creek.\n<\/p>\n<ul><li>Beware poison oak throughout the area.<\/li>\n<li>The geology in this area seems fairly unstable. Beware landslides and loose rocks.<\/li><\/ul>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Park at Mitchell Point.  From the parking area, backtrack down the road a short distance to find the gate signed for the \"Wyeth Trail\".  Follow the trail west about a mile.\n<\/p>\n<ul><li>En route you will pass the aforementioned two-tier 200ft falls set in a deep alcove on the left.  This falls stems from a low-flow creek which only runs in the early season and might be a good one to combine with Little Perham.  Reaching the top of this falls requires significant bushwhacking.  It is not known if this falls has been rappelled previously.  A small user trail leads to the base of the falls.<\/li><\/ul>\n<p>About a quarter-mile further west, reach a trail junction.  Turn left on the old Chetwoot Trail up under a powerline for about 0.4mi until the trail crosses the drainage of Little Perham. Head downstream 100yrds to the top of R1.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Head downstream to the top of R1.  \n<\/p>\n<ul><li>R1:  The falls is vertical for about 65ft, then the creek cascades down a series of short drops and low-angle bedrock ramps.  We climbed up a steep embankment and anchored off a tree DCR.  (Beware poison oak and use caution approaching the tree as the slope was pretty loose.)  Given the geologically unsettled nature of the canyon in 2016, we deemed it best to rappel right down the watercourse as the best means for avoiding rockfall.  We ran out a 60m rope all the way to the end which was suffficent to get down the main drop and about 2\/3rds of the way down the bedrock tiers.  Pulling the rope was clean, and we were able to downclimb the remainder to a large logjam at the very bottom.  In higher flow, it might be better to break this up into several shorter rappels - although anchors may be tricky to come by in the drainage.<\/li><\/ul>\n<p>Below the falls, continue down-canyon.  There are several downclimbs, but no real difficulties.  After 5min, reach confluence with Perham Creek.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Follow the Wygant Peak trail DCR back to your car.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Red_tape\">Red tape<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>None.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Beta_sites\">Beta sites<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Background\">Background<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Creek was probably first descended by Portland locals in 2016.\n<\/p><p>Perham Creek sports at least one major waterfall (30ft) located at about 600ft elevation on the creek - although reaching it was a bushwhack of epic proportions in 2016.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Further_Explorations\">Further Explorations<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Just east of Little Perham is another drainage sporting a 200ft two tier low-flow falls.
