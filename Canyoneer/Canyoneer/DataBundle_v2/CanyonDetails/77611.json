The following is from 2019.</p>\n<p>Carrabeanga is one of the hardest, if not the hardest, of the canyons\nflowing into Kanangra Creek. It is a remote wilderness trip requiring\nadvanced navigational and ropework skills. All of the party should have\nprevious experience in Kanangra canyons. Travel light and fast.</p>\n<p>Carrabeanga is not recommended as a winter trip, despite what you may\nsee elsewhere.</p>\n<p>It is sensible to drop water on the way in for the return trip.</p>\n<p>Park at the King Pin Firetrail on the Kanangra Walls road. Follow the\nKing Pin Firetrail to Mount Thurat. Follow the ridge along Thurat Tops\n(difficult routefinding) to the intersection of Thurat Ridge and Burra\nGunama Ridge at 32454 40633. Drop water here for the return trip. Follow\nBurra Gunama Ridge to Burra Gunama Hill. Walk down to Carrabeanga Brook,\naiming to strike the river at 34840 41423. Walk downstream to the first\nanchor at 34918 41382. Allow 2h30m for the walk in.</p>\n<p>Follow the attached abseil summary list, and topo of the Carrabeanga\nFalls. Pay particular attention to the comments for abseils 5, 6 and\n7.</p>\n<p>After an overnight camp on Kanangra Creek, exit via the ridge to the\nsouth of Cyclops Gully.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><img src=\"rwl_en.png\" title=\"rwl_en.png\" alt=\"rwl_en.png\" /><a\nhref=\"https://youtu.be/etzXvkSQQfw\">YouTube.com</a> : Richard Pattison,\nCarra Beanga Brook movie</li>\n</ul>\n<p>{{#ev:youtube|etzXvkSQQfw}}</p>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n<p>David Noble says: named by Myles Dunphy.
