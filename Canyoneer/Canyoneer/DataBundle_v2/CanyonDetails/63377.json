dir=\"ltr\"><p>With this figure eight shaped loop you descend the two best poison springs canyons and upclimb a 3rd canyon as part of the route.  This route might be the best bang-for-your-buck in the North Wash region with big down-climbs and a few long and stunning rappels. Both Slideanide and Constrychnine are worth doing, but a little short to do by themselves for efficient groups, so combining them makes the day more worth it.  The route time estimates assume that you completely downclimb Slideanide without setting any rappels, so add time if you aren't confident in your ability to downclimb.  There are two low 5th class climbing sections in this route that some might want a handline on, but are nothing too crazy.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Download and follow the GPS Tracks for this route from the map above.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>After a 15 minute or so approach, descend Slideanide, roping up if you are feeling extra soft. Some of the down-climbs look intimidating from above, but are straightforward once started. The final sequence has a a few awkward moves and is dark enough for a headlamp when not in direct light. <style data-mw-deduplicate=\"TemplateStyles:r1062633282\">@media all and (max-width:720px){.mw-parser-output .content .thumb>div:not(.thumbinner){display:flex;justify-content:center;flex-wrap:wrap;align-content:flex-start;flex-direction:column}}body.skin-vector .mw-parser-output div.thumb>div:not(.thumbinner){font-size:94%;text-align:center;overflow:hidden;min-width:100px}body.skin-minerva .mw-parser-output div.thumb>div:not(.thumbinner){margin:0 auto;max-width:100%!important}<\/style> \n<\/p>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\">\n<div style=\"display:table;\">\n<span class=\"mw-default-size\" typeof=\"mw:Error mw:File\/Frameless\">\n<\/div>\n<\/div><p>After the final sequence, head downcanyon, passing the end of constrychnine and the shortcut exit ramp that you'll be taking later until reaching the side-canyon that you'll be upclimbing. Nothing in this canyon is too dicy, but it is pretty physical. There is two sections of slot with a more open section between them.  you have to climb up to the next section of slot either by climbing up a steep varnished dike, or by going up the corner and doing a run across the face. <link rel=\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\" href=\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1062633282\"> \n<\/p><div class=\"thumb tright\">\n<div style=\"display:table;\">\n<span class=\"mw-default-size\" typeof=\"mw:Error mw:File\/Frameless\">\n<\/div>\n<\/div><p> After toping out the canyon, head straight towards constrychnine, crossing one side-canyon on the way that has a short climbing section getting up the cliff-bands on the other side (this can be bypassed adding more mileage). After reaching Constrychnine, rope up and enjoy the big rappel, deep slot, and light-rooms if you get lucky. <link rel=\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\" href=\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1062633282\"> \n<\/p><div class=\"thumb tright\">\n<div style=\"display:table;\">\n<span class=\"mw-default-size\" typeof=\"mw:Error mw:File\/Frameless\">\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>After finishing constrychnine, take the steep ramps out across from it on the west side of the canyon. The crux of the route is some low 5th class climbing up a chimney\/gully that has a fair amount of lose rock. There are good deep holds that take a little looking-around for, and a slab-ramp on the left that can be alternatively partner assisted. <link rel=\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\" href=\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1062633282\"> \n<\/p>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\">\n<div style=\"display:table;\">\n<span class=\"mw-default-size\" typeof=\"mw:Error mw:File\/Frameless\">\n<\/div>\n<\/div><p>The route from there takes you near the head of arsenic canyon, so if you have a couple hours to spare you can descend that canyon as well on your way out.
