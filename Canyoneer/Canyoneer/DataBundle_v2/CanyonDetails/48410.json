  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>Not a major objective, but a cool stream-walk with optional rappel\nthrough a classic Pacific NW canyon. This might be a good one for\nhalf-day or a rest day between more significant outings. This section of\nRock Creek is particularly nice with several short sections of narrows,\nbeautiful bedrock for hiking, and, the highlight: Tsolo Falls. A\nsurprisingly nice little gem. This section is run by whitewater kayakers\nin early season.</p>\n<p>Tsolo looks like it'd be fun to rappel, but bringing ropes, gear\n&amp; wetsuit into the canyon for a single 30ft drop (easily bypassed)\nmight not be worth it. Looks like great swimming in a number of the\npools. Use caution close to the falls as hydraulics were present in late\nJuly 2017.</p>\n<p>Be prepared to crisscross the creek numerous times and waist-deep\nwading. Rock creek can see seriously high water in the early season, so\nevaluate flow carefully before committing to this adventure.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<h3 id=\"lower_parking\">Lower Parking</h3>\n<p>From Bridge of the Gods, turn right on Hwy 14 and go 1.5mi. Turn left\nonto SW Rock Creek Dr for 0.3mi before turning left again onto Foster\nCreek Rd. Follow Foster Creek Rd (becomes Ryan-Allen Rd) for 0.9mi\nbefore turning off left onto Red Bluff Rd. Follow Red Bluff Rd down to\ncross a creek; it become gravel on the far side. At 0.7mi reach a Y-jct:\nbear right to stay on Red Bluff Rd. Follow Red Bluff Rd for 1.8mi\nfurther before turning off right on an unsigned road that switchbacks\ndown 0.2mi to a large bridge crossing Rock Creek. There are several\npullouts before the bridge which make good parking and room for several\nvehicles. Under the bridge is a popular swimming hole.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Be aware: a bunch of broken glass was found at the lower trailhead.\nTry not to leave anything of value in your car.</li>\n<li>It appears that idiots with no respect for the environment often\nfrequent the area around and under the bridge. Please help keep the area\nclean by packing out any trash you might find.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"upper_parking\">Upper Parking</h3>\n<p>Either drive or hike back up to Red Bluffs Rd and turn right. Go\nanother 1.3mi. There's no sign, but just a small pullout on the north\nside of the road big enough for two vehicles. A GPS may be handy\nhere.</p>\n<h3 id=\"bushwhack_in\">Bushwhack In</h3>\n<p>Walk along the road to find a culvert. Drop down and thrash your way\ninto the forest. You want to bear generally north / northwest. Head\nalong wherever is easiest and make your way down into the drainage of\nRock Creek (0.1mi; 5min). There are a couple of steep-ish slopes, but\nnothing too hard. If you get cliffed out, you are in the wrong place.\nDrop into the creek and go downstream.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>Head downstream about 5-10min, crisscrossing the creek as needed, to\nthe top of Tsolo Falls.</p>\n<h3 id=\"tsolo_falls_aka_three_swim_falls\">Tsolo Falls (aka Three Swim\nFalls)</h3>\n<p>An impressive 30ft drop on Rock Creek. The creek has carved its way\ndown through the bedrock, resulting in numerous interesting rock\nformations and water-worn potholes. The entire falls can be easily\nbypassed via a level \"sidewalk\" formation DCL. Climb down a narrow gully\nunder the spray of waterfall coming off an unnamed tributary DCL.</p>\n<p>It is not known if Tsolo Falls has been rappelled previously. Beware\nhydraulics. Here's the specs:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>R1: 30ft. Flow can be high on Rock Creek, so choose your anchor\nappropriately. There appears to be an interesting cave-like space\nunderneath a giant car-sized chockstone wedged at the top of the\nwaterfall. The rappel finishes in a deep beautiful pool.</li>\n<li>The creek exits the pool by flowing over a 3-4ft step into a pothole\nhydraulic. To be on the safe side, exit to the pool to a ledge DCL --\nand jump past the hydraulic into the next pool downstream.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"to_the_bridge\">To the Bridge</h3>\n<p>Continue downstream. Expect to crisscross the creek numerous times\nand you will need to wade in other places. Pass through numerous small\nsections of narrows, cool rock formations, beautiful sculpted bedrock,\nand swimming holes. In July 2017 we were able to largely stick to the\nsouth / DCR side of the creek. Often the water is shallow and there are\nnice areas of flat bedrock for easy walking / shallow wading. Keep going\ndownstream until you reach the road-bridge across Rock Creek. Expect the\nhike to take around 2hrs.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>Under the bridge, look DCR for a trail that switchbacks up the road.\nThis is probably the easiest means of exit.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<p>None.</p>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a\nhref=\"https://www.waterfallsnorthwest.com/waterfall/Steep-Creek-Falls-5168\">https://www.waterfallsnorthwest.com/waterfall/Steep-Creek-Falls-5168</a></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>The hiking route to Tsolo Falls is described in the latest edition\nof <strong>Curious Gorge</strong> - a hiking guidebook by Scott\nCook.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><a\nhref=\"http://pdxriverexplorers.blogspot.com/2009/06/afternoon-on-rock-creek-wa.html\">Kayakers\nhitting Tsolo in high flow.</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n<p>The USGS map shows a hot spring downstream of the bridge, but it's\ndefunct / non-existent and not worth your time.</p>\n<h2 id=\"extra_bonus_steep_creek_falls\">Extra Bonus: Steep Creek\nFalls</h2>\n<p>Continuing a mile or so past the upper parking area will reach\nanother bridge over Rock Creek. Look to your left crossing the bridge to\nsee <em>Steep Creek Falls</em>. There's a pullout just before the\nbridge. If you're looking for a quick &amp; easy rappel, follow a steep\nuser trail upwards on the east side of the bridge. The trail climbs a\nshort bluff, then drops steeply back in right above the falls. (While\nyou're here, it's worth a quick walk upstream on beautiful bedrock slabs\nto see a short 10ft drop about 100yrds upstream. Beyond the creek\nappears to become choked with boulders.)</p>\n<p>R1: 60ft. Anchored off a tree DCL. Drop straight down with a short\nfree hang at the bottom to the edge of Rock Creek. Wetsuits were not\nnecessary in late July 2017.</p>\n<p>Walk downstream under the bridge and keep going until you find a\nsmall user trail DCR leading back up to the road.</p>\n",
