{"vehicle":"Passenger","rappelCountMin":0,"description":"<div class=\"mw-content-ltr mw-parser-output\" lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><p>Not a major objective, but a cool stream-walk with optional rappel through a classic Pacific NW canyon.  This might be a good one for half-day or a rest day between more significant outings.  This section of Rock Creek is particularly nice with several short sections of narrows, beautiful bedrock for hiking, and, the highlight:  Tsolo Falls.  A surprisingly nice little gem.  This section is run by whitewater kayakers in early season.\n<\/p><p>Tsolo looks like it'd be fun to rappel, but bringing ropes, gear &amp; wetsuit into the canyon for a single 30ft drop (easily bypassed) might not be worth it.  Looks like great swimming in a number of the pools.  Use caution close to the falls as hydraulics were present in late July 2017.\n<\/p><p>Be prepared to crisscross the creek numerous times and waist-deep wading.  Rock creek can see seriously high water in the early season, so evaluate flow carefully before committing to this adventure.\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading3\"><h3 id=\"Lower_Parking\">Lower Parking<\/h3><\/div>\n<p>From Bridge of the Gods, turn right on Hwy 14 and go 1.5mi.  Turn left onto SW Rock Creek Dr for 0.3mi before turning left again onto Foster Creek Rd.   Follow Foster Creek Rd (becomes Ryan-Allen Rd) for 0.9mi before turning off left onto Red Bluff Rd.  Follow Red Bluff Rd down to cross a creek;  it become gravel on the far side.  At 0.7mi reach a Y-jct:  bear right to stay on Red Bluff Rd.  Follow Red Bluff Rd for 1.8mi further before turning off right on an unsigned road that switchbacks down 0.2mi to a large bridge crossing Rock Creek.  There are several pullouts before the bridge which make good parking and room for several vehicles.  Under the bridge is a popular swimming hole.\n<\/p>\n<ul><li>Be aware:  a bunch of broken glass was found at the lower trailhead.  Try not to leave anything of value in your car.<\/li>\n<li>It appears that idiots with no respect for the environment often frequent the area around and under the bridge.

Go another 1.3mi.  There's no sign, but just a small pullout on the north side of the road big enough for two vehicles.  A GPS may be handy here.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading3\"><h3 id=\"Bushwhack_In\">Bushwhack In<\/h3><\/div>\n<p>Walk along the road to find a culvert.  Drop down and thrash your way into the forest.  You want to bear generally north \/ northwest.  Head along wherever is easiest and make your way down into the drainage of Rock Creek (0.1mi;  5min).  There are a couple of steep-ish slopes, but nothing too hard.  If you get cliffed out, you are in the wrong place.  Drop into the creek and go downstream.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Head downstream about 5-10min, crisscrossing the creek as needed, to the top of Tsolo Falls.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading3\"><h3 id=\"Tsolo_Falls_(aka_Three_Swim_Falls)\"><span id=\"Tsolo_Falls_.28aka_Three_Swim_Falls.29\"><\/span>Tsolo Falls (aka Three Swim Falls)<\/h3><\/div>\n<p>An impressive 30ft drop on Rock Creek.  The creek has carved its way down through the bedrock, resulting in numerous interesting rock formations and water-worn potholes.  The entire falls can be easily bypassed via a level \"sidewalk\" formation DCL.  Climb down a narrow gully under the spray of waterfall coming off an unnamed tributary DCL.\n<\/p><p>It is not known if Tsolo Falls has been rappelled previously.  Beware hydraulics.  Here's the specs:\n<\/p>\n<ul><li>R1:  30ft.  Flow can be high on Rock Creek, so choose your anchor appropriately.  There appears to be an interesting cave-like space underneath a giant car-sized chockstone wedged at the top of the waterfall.  The rappel finishes in a deep beautiful pool.<\/li>\n<li>The creek exits the pool by flowing over a 3-4ft step into a pothole hydraulic.  To be on the safe side, exit to the pool to a ledge DCL -- and jump past the hydraulic into the next pool downstream.<\/li><\/ul>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading3\"><h3 id=\"To_the_Bridge\">To the Bridge<\/h3><\/div>\n<p>Continue downstream.  Expect to crisscross the creek numerous times and you will need to wade in other places.  Pass through numerous small sections of narrows, cool rock formations, beautiful sculpted bedrock, and swimming holes.  In July 2017 we were able to largely stick to the south \/ DCR side of the creek.  Often the water is shallow and there are nice areas of flat bedrock for easy walking \/ shallow wading.  Keep going downstream until you reach the road-bridge across Rock Creek.  Expect the hike to take around 2hrs.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Under the bridge, look DCR for a trail that switchbacks up the road.
