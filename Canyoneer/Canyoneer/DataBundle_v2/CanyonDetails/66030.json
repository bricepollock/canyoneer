  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>This short canyon drops quickly off a large headwall, and has\nnumerous pools along the way. Since the drainage is small, an early\nseason run will be more sporty with cold waterflow.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>Follow down the Kings for a 1/4 mile then climb up North of a big\ngranite headwall following cairns and a faint use trail. (GPS track\ncoming soon to the KML map file).</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<p>We explored 2 exit paths on 29JUL2021 and took pictures (banner of\nthe headwall), but have yet to run the canyon itself. We downclimbed the\nfinal short drops to the North Fork of the Kings River.</p>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n",
