  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>Nice add-on to the classical Rosenlaui Inf. You only need to walk\nabout 20 more minutes. The canyon is primarily equiped for now, some\ndownclimbs are quite hard (so if you repeat it, bringing a drill and at\nleast 5 anchors is a good idea.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>Same as the Lower part, but then continue another 20 min towards the\nDossenh√ºtte. At a height of 1670m, there is a bridge over the canyon,\nthis is where it starts.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>The first part has a nice narrow. Then you'll have to go across a\nmore bouldery section, before reaching the first bigger (20m) abseil.\nFrom there on it is a quite deep and large canyon.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>Go back through the hikong trail, or continue immediatly with the\nRosenlaui inf.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n",
