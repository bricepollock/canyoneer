  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>Lower Big Granite canyon is a super fun, very short canyon way down\nalong the North Fork of the American. While it only has one rappel, that\nrappel is really really cool, and there are several good jumps, swims,\nand a beautiful gorge to enjoy.</p>\n<p>Obviously it is not really worth your while to drop over 3,000 feet\ndown to the river to do this short canyon. As such, the best way to do\nit is on your way out from descending Big Valley Canyon.</p>\n<p>There is also an upper section of Big Granite that looks to have some\nlarge waterfalls, and possibly great canyoneering! It is quite remote,\nand would require an extended descent of flat creek from the bottom of\nthe technical section to the Big Granite trail crossing, which is near\nthe start of Lower Big Granite.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>From the Big Granite Creek camp (39.224059,-120.529954), cross Big\nGranite Creek and find the trail on the other side. Take a left hand\nswitchback where another trail drops down to the right. A righthand\nswitchback afterwards is hard not to miss, so turn around and look for\nit when the trail disappears. Continue up and over a rock ridge, then\ntraverse across some scree. Look for a waterfall on your left where\nLittle Granite Creek drops down, and find a gully that is easy to\ndescend to reach the confluence of Big and Little Granite\n(39.228559,-120.523737).</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>Boulder hop downstream. The canyon starts off with two fun jumps back\nto back. Following drops are probably best downclimbed as you drop\ndeeper into the beautiful gorge. Eventually the gorge grows narrow as\nyou approach the rappel. The rappel is about 80 feet down an awesome\nsliding waterfall. It almost looks like you could slide down the whole\nthing... but it's really big. My recommendation is to have someone climb\nup onto the rock shelf on the left, and look down so that you can set\nthe rope length to just over half way down where the slide becomes more\nsmooth. Then rappel down off the end of your rope and enjoy the\nslide!</p>\n<p>Swim out of the pool and head down stream. You'll get to the two\nwaterfalls above camp. You can jump the first, then climb out to the\nleft. The second fall has some sketchy ledges poking out and would be a\nlittle difficult to get a good jump off of.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>Take a break, and then start the hike up!</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<p>Alwin's Facebook Album</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a\nhref=\"https://www.facebook.com/alwin.acuna/posts/1181848261867639\">https://www.facebook.com/alwin.acuna/posts/1181848261867639</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n",
