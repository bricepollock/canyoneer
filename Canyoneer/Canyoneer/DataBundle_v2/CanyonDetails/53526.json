  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>The via ferrata starts high above the Lauterbrunnen Valley in the\nlovely village of M端rren (1,800m) and from there it leads steeply\ndownwards. As a rule, via ferratas lead upwards but in contrast, the\nroute leads from M端rren almost directly down in the direction of\nGimmelwald. The via ferrata usually takes about three hours and covers\n2.2 km with a difference in altitude of 400m. The words \"via ferrata\"\ncome from the Italian language and mean way of iron or iron way and\nsignify a sort of intermediate stage between normal mountain hiking and\nfree climbing.</p>\n<p>The via ferrata M端rren - Gimmelwald is passable from 15 June to 31\nOctober caused of wildlife provisions. The maintenance works will happen\njust before.</p>\n<p><a\nhref=\"https://muerren.swiss/en/summer/product/page/via-ferrata-muerren-gimmelwald-693/\">https://muerren.swiss/en/summer/product/page/via-ferrata-muerren-gimmelwald-693/</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<p>Must pay for the gondola to access the via ferrata</p>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n",
