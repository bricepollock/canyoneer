  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>Blackheath's Grand Canyon is a relatively short, easily accessible\nbut still stunningly beautify canyon.</p>\n<p>It's also worth noting that Grand Canyon is one of the best night\ncanyoning options in the Blue Mountains. The walls are lined with\nstunning glowworms and the fact that most of the canyon is quite flat\nallows sections of it to be completed with head torches turned off.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>Car Park: Leave the car at the Neates Glen car park which is\napproximately 3km down Govetts leap road.</p>\n<p>Walk-in: Follow the tourist track down the hill and along the base of\nthe cliff as it winds its way along beside the creek. After approx 1.5km\nthe track passes through a short tunnel. The abseil point is on the left\nabout 300m past the tunnel. It is signposted and bolted.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>Once you abseil in it is fairly straight forward to make your way\ndown the canyon</p>\n<p>The abseil is about 12 meters down an overhanging ledge. The anchor\nis a 3 point chain anchor that has been bolted into the rock near the\npathway. The anchor and abseiling area is fenced off to separate it from\nthe tourist track. After abseiling into the canyon you will walk through\nthe rest of the canyon mostly dry, but with a few very short swims and\nwades. There is one possible jump in, but it is much easier to climb\ndown than jump as the jump requires clearing about 2.5 meters of rock\nledge. Jumping is not recommended. Shortly before the end is a 30 meter\nswim, which is the longest swim in the entire canyon. The whole canyon\nwouldn't take more than a couple of hours to complete, the end clearly\nmarked by a sign pointing uphill to the Grand Canyon Walking track (the\ntrack which was left at the abseil point and which followed the whole\ncanyon from above), and further downstream to the Evans Lookout.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>Walkout: Just past a 30m swim the canyon opens out slightly and the\ntourist trail comes back down to near creek level on the right just\nbefore a minor creek comes in. Once you reach the Grand Canyon Walking\nTrack at the end of the canyon, you can either walk back up the track\nand follow the canyon back upstream from above. This is the faster route\nand interesting because you regularly find yourself right on the edge of\nthe canyon cliffs looking straight back down into Grand canyon. The\nother option is to follow the path all the way down to Evans Lookout and\nthen walk back up Evans Lookout Road to the parking lot.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<p><a\nhref=\"https://ozultimate.com/canyoning/track_notes/grand.htm\">https://ozultimate.com/canyoning/track_notes/grand.htm</a></p>\n<ul>\n<li><img src=\"rwl_fr.png\" title=\"rwl_fr.png\" alt=\"rwl_fr.png\" /><a\nhref=\"http://descente-canyon.com/canyoning/canyon-description/21637\">Descente-Canyon.com</a>\n: Grand Canyon</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<p>{{#ev:youtube|PSIGu0bOAQ4}}</p>\n<ul>\n<li><img src=\"rwl_auto.png\" title=\"rwl_auto.png\" alt=\"rwl_auto.png\" /><a\nhref=\"http://wikiloc.com/wikiloc/view.do?id=16178953\">Wikiloc.com</a> :\nGrand Canyon \\/ Grose Valley</li>\n<li><img src=\"rwl_en.png\" title=\"rwl_en.png\" alt=\"rwl_en.png\" /><a\nhref=\"https://youtu.be/Z0aZIKRKUh4\">YouTube.com</a> : Richard Pattison,\nGrand Canyon movie</li>\n</ul>\n<p>{{#ev:youtube|Z0aZIKRKUh4}} <a\nhref=\"https://sleepwhenwearedead.net/2020/10/30/a-grand-afternoon-outing/\">https://sleepwhenwearedead.net/2020/10/30/a-grand-afternoon-outing/</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n",
