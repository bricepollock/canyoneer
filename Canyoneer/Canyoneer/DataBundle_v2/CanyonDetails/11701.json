The walls are lined with stunning glowworms and the fact that most of the canyon is quite flat allows sections of it to be completed with head torches turned off.\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Car Park: Leave the car at the Neates Glen car park which is approximately 3km down Govetts leap road.\n<\/p><p>Walk-in: Follow the tourist track down the hill and along the base of the cliff as it winds its way along beside the creek. After approx 1.5km the track passes through a short tunnel. The abseil point is on the left about 300m past the tunnel. It is signposted and bolted.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Once you abseil in it is fairly straight forward to make your way down the canyon\n<\/p><p>The abseil is about 12 meters down an overhanging ledge. The anchor is a 3 point chain anchor that has been bolted into the rock near the pathway.\nThe anchor and abseiling area is fenced off to separate it from the tourist track.\nAfter abseiling into the canyon you will walk through the rest of the canyon mostly dry, but with a few very short swims and wades. There is one possible jump in, but it is much easier to climb down than jump as the jump requires clearing about 2.5 meters of rock ledge. Jumping is not recommended.\nShortly before the end is a 30 meter swim, which is the longest swim in the entire canyon.\nThe whole canyon wouldn't take more than a couple of hours to complete, the end clearly marked by a sign pointing uphill to the Grand Canyon Walking track (the track which was left at the abseil point and which followed the whole canyon from above), and further downstream to the Evans Lookout.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Walkout: Just past a 30m swim the canyon opens out slightly and the tourist trail comes back down to near creek level on the right just before a minor creek comes in. Once you reach the Grand Canyon Walking Track at the end of the canyon, you can either walk back up the track and follow the canyon back upstream from above. This is the faster route and interesting because you regularly find yourself right on the edge of the canyon cliffs looking straight back down into Grand canyon. The other option is to follow the path all the way down to Evans Lookout and then walk back up Evans Lookout Road to the parking lot.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Red_tape\">Red tape<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Beta_sites\">Beta sites<\/h2><\/div>\n<p><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external free\" href=\"https:\/\/ozultimate.com\/canyoning\/track_notes\/grand.htm\">https:\/\/ozultimate.com\/canyoning\/track_notes\/grand.htm<\/a>\n<\/p>\n<ul><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http:\/\/descente-canyon.com\/canyoning\/canyon-description\/21637\">Descente-Canyon.com<\/a> &#160;: Grand Canyon<\/li><\/ul>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media<\/h2><\/div>\n<ul><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http:\/\/wikiloc.com\/wikiloc\/view.do?id=16178953\">Wikiloc.com<\/a> &#160;: Grand Canyon \\\/ Grose Valley<\/li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/Z0aZIKRKUh4\">YouTube.com<\/a>&#160;: Richard Pattison, Grand Canyon movie<\/li><\/ul>\n<p><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external free\" href=\"https:\/\/sleepwhenwearedead.net\/2020\/10\/30\/a-grand-afternoon-outing\/\">https:\/\/sleepwhenwearedead.net\/2020\/10\/30\/a-grand-afternoon-outing\/<\/a>\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Background\">Background<\/h2><\/div>\n\n\n<\/div>","technicalRating":3,"months":["Dec","Jan","Feb","Mar","Oct","Nov","Apr"]}
