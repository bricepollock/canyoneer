  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>Basaltic rock dome near the Columbia River. This is a very popular\nrock climbing site, with routes that go from the base all the way to the\ntop. There is also an easy 1 mile hiking trail that uses multiple\nstairs, ledges and bridges to climb to the top of the rock. Going here\njust to rappel is a bit goofy.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>Park at the turnout near the bathrooms at the base of the dome. From\nhere several hiking trails extend around and up the Beacon rock.\nCanyoneers will want to hike to the top of the rock and rappel down from\nthere. Rock climbers will want to climb to the top and then use the\ntrail to come back down. Hikers can enjoy the easy but spectacular hike\nup to the top.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>There are multiple anchors installed on established rock climbing\nroutes, their locations are documented on rock climbing books and some\nrock climbing websites (see beta section). A detailed Rock Climbing\nRoutes Map can be purchased for $5 from <a\nhref=\"http://www.portlandrockclimbs.com/\">http://www.portlandrockclimbs.com/</a>.</p>\n<p>Some basic safety tips for this descent:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Set rappel as single strand with releasable block to give more rope\nif needed (see <a href=\"Figure_8_block\"\ntitle=\"wikilink\">Figure_8_block</a>)</li>\n<li>Slowly creep the rope as people are rappeling to avoid focal\nabrasion from rock edges (basalt rocks are sharp)</li>\n<li>For first man down, tie a big knot at the end of rope to avoid risk\nof rappeling off the end</li>\n<li>First man down should be ready to ascend if he missed an established\nanchor or reached the end of your rope</li>\n<li>Once first man down finds the next anchor, he should tie the end of\nthe rope to the anchor to secure the rappel for rest of team</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The descent is basically a multistage 650ft-800ft rappel, depending\non what face you choose:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>NorthEast face: almost completely vertical, likely to require cams,\npitons or bolts.</li>\n<li>NorthWest face: mostly vertical but with some ledges and trees\nsuitable for natural anchors.</li>\n<li>SouthWest face: mostly sloped with abundance of trees and rock\nplatforms for natural anchors.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>Once down at the bottom just walk back to the car.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<p>An $10/day or $30/year Adventure Pass is required to park in the\narea.</p>\n<p>State Park rules dictate to use \"earth colored\" webbing for any\npermanent anchors and to request a special permit if you are going to\ninstall bolts.</p>\n<p>As of October 2014, it seems the NorthEast face of Beacon Rock may be\nclosed to rock climbing but the SouthWest and NorthWest sides are open.\n</p>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a\nhref=\"http://www.mountainproject.com/v/beacon-rock/105789001\">Rock\nClimbing Routes</a></li>\n<li><img src=\"rwl_en.png\" title=\"rwl_en.png\" alt=\"rwl_en.png\" /><a\nhref=\"http://summitpost.org/southeast-face/158766\">SummitPost.org</a>\n:</li>\n<li><a\nhref=\"http://cascadeclimbers.com/forum/ubbthreads.php?ubb=showflat&amp;Number=1113351\">SouthEast\nFace: Jill Thrill Variation</a></li>\n<li><a\nhref=\"http://cascadeclimbers.com/forum/ubbthreads.php?ubb=showflat&amp;Number=1115593\">SouthEast\nFace: Right Gull Vulcan's Variation</a></li>\n<li><a\nhref=\"http://www.washingtonclimbers.org/Climbing/beacon.htm\">Washington\nClimbers</a></li>\n<li><a\nhref=\"http://www.portlandhikersfieldguide.org/wiki/Beacon_Rock_Hike\">Portland\nHiker's Field Guide</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.parks.wa.gov/474/Beacon-Rock\">State Park\nWebsite</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n<p>On July 24 2011 Nathan Turner died while rappeling down Jill's Thrill\nroute.
