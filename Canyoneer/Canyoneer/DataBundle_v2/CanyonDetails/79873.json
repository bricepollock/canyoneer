{"description":"<div class=\"mw-content-ltr mw-parser-output\" lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><p>A quick shortie canyon destination where Prospector Creek flows through a narrows into the Washougal River. While only having one rappel, there's some beautiful bedrock, deep pools, jump potential, and a fun place to explore on a hot summer day. It's a mellow hike in and out on an ATV trail. Prospector might be combined with other destinations in the area (ex: Three Corner Creek).\n<\/p>\n<ul><li>There are two bridge-less creek crossings on the way in. You might find a way across, but be prepared to get your feet wet.<\/li>\n<li>The area is known to locals who use ATVs and motorbikes to get in and out. In summer, you may encounter non-canyoneers hanging out in the pools. Please help us keep the area clean and pick up any trash you may encounter.<\/li><\/ul>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading3\"><h3 id=\"Driving\">Driving<\/h3><\/div>\n<p>From Hwy 14 in Washougal, WA take the Washougal River Road north to Dougan Falls. Continue on the same road, now good dirt\/gravel, for another 8.3mi to a T-junction. Turn left and continue 1.4mi to where a new logging bridge crosses Prospector Creek (might be dry in summer). There is a parking area\/campsite just before the bridge. Drive-time is about 1hr.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading3\"><h3 id=\"Hike_In\">Hike In<\/h3><\/div>\n<p>Behind the remains of the old bridge which once crossed the creek here, hike the ATV trail about 1mi to Prospector Falls. There are two creek crossings along the way, plus you'll pass the remnants of two more older bridges back when this was a road. Easy walk that takes maybe 15min.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>DCR = Down Canyon Right; DCL = Down Canyon Left.\n<\/p><p>Jumping is a major cause of canyon accidents. Always scout the pool first.  Just because it was a great jump last year...\n<\/p><p>At the end of the old road (the ATV trail continues on), drop down an obvious user trail to the top of the falls. \n<\/p>\n<ul><li>R1: you need 60ft of rope for the 15 foot falls. Anchor from a tree DCR into a pool. Go back to collect your anchor afterwards as this is a tourist area. This is a 20 foot jump from rocks DCL.<\/li><\/ul>\n<ul><li>J1: 3ft at the exit into a deep swimming hole. Ledges around the pool offer more options for higher jumps.<\/li><\/ul>\n<p>Take your time and make your way down the bedrock to a boulder garden \/ logjam near the confluence with the Washougal River. Expect a little scrambling in here, but it's not hard. Upon meeting the Washougal, make your way upstream to find Washougal Falls. There is another deep swimming hole right before the falls with more jump potential from ledges. Another fun place to explore.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Just below Washougal Falls beach area, look for a cut log on the east bank (DCL). Scramble up a rock here to find a user trail leading back up to the ATV track. It was flagged in 2023. Follow the track back to your car.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Red_tape\">Red tape<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>While there is no signage as such, the entire area is on land owned by the Washington State Department of Natural Resources (DNR).
