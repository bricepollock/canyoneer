This short canyon features some beautiful backcountry hiking and two pretty rappels into small slotted grottos.

Use blocks of rock in crack and ample trees to scramble ~30ft up a class 4 wall, then ~20 more up a dry chute. From here, gain the small ridge to the right before dropping back into the drainage once it mellows. One more upclimb up a small cliff band (I used the dead log) will get you past the worst of it.
