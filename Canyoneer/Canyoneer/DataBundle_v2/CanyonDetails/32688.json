  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>A nice hike down a very seldom travelled route. Home to the mountain\nlion. Big cat prints are common to see in the mud. You will not see her\nbut she will be watching you.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>There are numerous opportunities to rappel down into the wash level\nfrom the mesa level. Or you can hike down from a side canyon to the\nsouth from Silveys Pocket.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>When you reach the confluence with the Dolores River, head upstream a\nfew hundred feet then up the only place that looks like it will go.\nRequires some Class 4 scrambling. Once on the mesa level, hiker trails\nwill lead you back to the car.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n",
