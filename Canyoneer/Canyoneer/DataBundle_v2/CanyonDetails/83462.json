  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>This canyon is super long and has a crazy slot section. It is located\nin Leslie Gulch, at the near the beginning of the main canyon. Make sure\nto bring plenty of rope because there are some decently long rappels.\nJust so you know the midsection of this canyon is unexplored to my\nknowledge, so be careful and take precautions.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>You can drive to the scree slope that is at the beginning of the\ncanyon. But you need a vehicle with good clearance and off-roading\ntires, because the road is more of a lightly used trail.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>I was only able to make it partway down the canyon (not enough rope)\nbut the part we did explore had three rappels (20, 40, and 150\nfeet).</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>Hike on the side of the canyon or have a second car at the upper\nleslie gulch trailhead.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<p>If anyone wants to plan a trip to go here with me or wants more\nphotos, send me an email at codyrigg8@gmail.com</p>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n<p>The rock here is pretty bad because its compressed ash, so be\ncareful.</p>\n",
