No campfires, and if you decide to camp, double-check that you are doing so legally. Since these regulations just recently went into effect, expect a heavy enforcement presence for summer 2017. No alcohol in the Three Pools Day Use Area, which could be part of a canyoneering descent of this creek.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Beta_sites\">Beta sites<\/h2><\/div>\n<ul><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20210527212206\/www.canyoneeringnorthwest.com\/NorthSantiamRiver\/North_Santiam_River.php\">CanyoneeringNorthwest.com (archive.org)<\/a> &#160;: Little North Santiam River (Opal Creek)<\/li><\/ul>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Background\">Background<\/h2><\/div>\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nParsed by mw‐api‐ext.codfw.main‐6779cc57fc‐z7s7v\nCached time: 20240914191910\nCache expiry: 2592000\nReduced expiry: false\nComplications: [show‐toc]\nCPU time usage: 0.033 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.040 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 116\/1000000\nPost‐expand include size: 545\/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 0\/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 8\/100\nExpensive parser function count: 0\/500\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0\/20\nUnstrip post‐expand size: 529\/5000000 bytes\nLua time usage: 0.002\/10.000 seconds\nLua memory usage: 606898\/52428800 bytes\nNumber of Wikibase entities loaded: 0\/400\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%   30.640      1 -total\n100.00%   30.640      1 Template:Pic\n 52.66%   16.136      1 Template:Str_number\/trim\n-->\n<\/div>","rappelLongestMeters":null,"url":"https:\/\/ropewiki.com\/Little_North_Santiam_(Opal_Creek)"}
