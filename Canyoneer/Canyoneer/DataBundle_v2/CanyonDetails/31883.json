class=\"mw-content-ltr mw-parser-output\" lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><p>Upper Asbestos has a signature 500' multi-pitch waterfall rappel, crack traverse, big waterfalls, and rooster tails. The canyon loses 3,100 ft in over 1 mile and the Upper Upper section has still not yet been fully descended (from the confluence around 2800' has been). In high flow asbestos should only be attempted by experienced canyoneers .\n<\/p><p>The best time to experience this canyon in high flow is during the Spring months (though the temperatures will be colder and weather more unpredictable). By late June\/July, the canyon will likely be flowing at moderate flow and still provide a fun and non-stop action canyon for beginner canyoneers.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>The bushwhacking for both the Upper and Lower is not very thick. If it wasn't for the moderate steepness and elevation gain, it wouldn't be unpleasant at all. Although long pants and gloves are still not a bad idea. There are however a number of rock faces that have to be bypassed. The first major one is best going around to the left (sure about this? Going left at 1700ft leads to a steep unfun gully). The others typically right and occasionally head on. Stay near or slightly right of the crest of the ridge visible on the map just north of the canyon. Going too far left can lead to thicker vegetation and potentially cliff faces. Near the 2800' mark it may be necessary to side hill slightly steeper terrain if too far left.\n<\/p><p><br \/>\n<b>Approach Lower Asbestos<\/b>\n<\/p><p>Bushwhack up the north side of the canyon, following the advice above. You're aiming for the pool at about 1800', between R10 &amp; R11. It seems better to keep climbing past 1800' then find a way to drop down into the canyon, meeting the creek at 1800'. Finding the best approach into the canyon is unclear. One possibility is to rappel 100' from a tree directly across from the R12 bolts. Please document other approaches if you find them.\n<\/p><p><br \/>\n<b>Approach Upper Asbestos<\/b>\n<\/p><p>Bushwhack up the mountain side (on the north side) to about 2800 ft near the confluence visible on the map. Downclimb to near the low point of a piece of cliff jutting out at about 48.1929, -121.5872 just above the confluence of the Upper Upper fork and a possibly dry fork (the obvious confluence on the map). \n<\/p><p>There are at least two options for entry (no webbing currently installed for either):\n<\/p>\n<ul><li>1. Find a tree on the right side and rappel 200' down the side of the dry fork to the bottom and the confluence.<\/li>\n<li>2. Veer more left to a large tree.
