Take a right and drive to you reach Brewer Rd. There is a nice camping spot on the left .5 up. You can also camp where the road crosses Simmons Creek. Walk the old logging road along Simmons Creek until just before the confluence. R 1, which we did not run awaits. Looks to be a two tiered 40 foot drop.
