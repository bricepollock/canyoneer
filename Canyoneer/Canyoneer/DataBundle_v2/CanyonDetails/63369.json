Take a right and drive to you reach Brewer Rd. There is a nice camping spot on the left .5 up. You can also camp where the road crosses Simmons Creek. Walk the old logging road along Simmons Creek until just before the confluence. R 1, which we did not run awaits. Looks to be a two tiered 40 foot drop. We were interested in the bigger stuff.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>R1- (undescended) 40ish foot two tiered drop into a small gorge\n<\/p><p>R2- 40‚Äù from a tree DCL\n<\/p><p>R3- 80‚Äù from a bolt DCL, if anyone wants this adventure a bolt station DCR could be a much better and safer route as DCL puts you either in the brunt of the flow or hanging from a very sharp rock.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Although we did not take this way out, exit DCL when able and walk back up to the old road you came in on.
