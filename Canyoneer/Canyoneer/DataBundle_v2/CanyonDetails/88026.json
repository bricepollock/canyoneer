with a particular emphasis on deep pothole swimming and slippery footing. The nearby <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https:\/\/ropewiki.com\/Gingercake_Creek_Canyon\">Gingercake Creek<\/a> empties into Steels a quarter mile upstream of the start, making this drainage noticeably bigger with higher flows and a touch of warmer water. When the state is in drought conditions, this route still maintains its Class C character.\n<\/p><p>Steels Creek has ample opportunities to bail early if weather turns or flow is too gnarly, since the MST parallels the waterway for most of the route. Because of that and the abundance of swimming holes, it's not too uncommon to run into intermittent groups of swimmers at the most accessible parts of the creek - which always makes for interesting looks as you pass by all decked out in gear. The route features a mixture of bolted and natural anchors, as well as necessary rigging of a retrievable traverse line to access the anchors for the 4th rappel. Come prepared!\n<\/p>\n<ul><li>Note - you could also shorten this excursion by dropping into the creek right above Steels Creek Falls, then run it from that point back. This makes for an excellent short day adventure or \"tack on\" to another one. See the approach beta for details.<\/li><\/ul>\n<style data-mw-deduplicate=\"TemplateStyles:r1062633282\">@media all and (max-width:720px){.mw-parser-output .content .thumb>div:not(.thumbinner){display:flex;justify-content:center;flex-wrap:wrap;align-content:flex-start;flex-direction:column}}body.skin-vector .mw-parser-output div.thumb>div:not(.thumbinner){font-size:94%;text-align:center;overflow:hidden;min-width:100px}body.skin-minerva .mw-parser-output div.thumb>div:not(.thumbinner){margin:0 auto;max-width:100%!important}<\/style> \n<div class=\"thumb tright\">\n<div style=\"display:table;\">\n<span class=\"mw-default-size\" typeof=\"mw:Error mw:File\/Frameless\">\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<link rel=\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\" href=\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1062633282\"> \n<div class=\"thumb tright\">\n<div style=\"display:table;\">\n<span class=\"mw-default-size\" typeof=\"mw:Error mw:File\/Frameless\">\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Access FR228 from HWY 181, about 3.4 miles south of the Brown Mountain Overlook. Drive 4 miles down the dirt road until you reach the end. There is a large parking area here that can fit 5-7 cars, depending on how well everyone parks. The white blazed MST trail picks up from here, at the end of the road. About 1.6 miles after turning onto FR228, you'll cross Little Fork Creek. If that crossing is spicy for your vehicle, then water levels are likely too high to run the creek.\n<\/p><p>From the parking, head north up the MST for 0.2mi. At that point, the trail crosses Steels Creek above a cascade and swimming hole, then picks back up on the other side. Make a mental note of this spot because it can be easy to miss this exit after coming back down the creek. Once back on the trail after the crossing, the MST will make a right hand turn and continue north. From this point, the start of the route is another 1.1 miles further up the trail - located here: 35.92548, -81.84714. There are two spots where the trail can be tricky to follow as it scrambles up rocky sections. Just keep looking for the white blazes on trees if you lose it. \n<\/p><p>In 0.5mi after the crossing, there will be a short spur trail down to a precarious and slippery ledge that overlooks Steels Creek Falls proper and the massive pothole\/swimming hole. Personally speaking, I would skip this view in lieu of experiencing it top-down if this is your first time here. But it's good to note where this is, in case the flow is too strong and you need to bail. *If doing the shorten version, then drop in above this waterfall by following a short and faint spur path a couple dozen yards up the trail. This will put you at the R2 beta and forward.\n<\/p><p>1 mile after the initial creek crossing, there will be another spur trail (located here: 35.92469, -81.84743) that goes down to the base of what is known as the Teacups - a series of about 7 potholes. The route begins just above the Teacups, which you can see from the MST. So once you get there, continue on the MST until you can see that you're past the pothole formations, then dive off trail and into the creek. Find a suitable place to gear and suit up here.\n<\/p>\n<link rel=\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\" href=\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1062633282\"> \n<div class=\"thumb tright\">\n<div style=\"display:table;\">\n<span class=\"mw-default-size\" typeof=\"mw:Error mw:File\/Frameless\">\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<link rel=\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\" href=\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1062633282\"> \n<div class=\"thumb tright\">\n<div style=\"display:table;\">\n<span class=\"mw-default-size\" typeof=\"mw:Error mw:File\/Frameless\">\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Swim, wade, and scramble through the Teacups.
