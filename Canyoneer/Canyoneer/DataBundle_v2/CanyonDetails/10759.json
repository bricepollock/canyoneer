  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>This is a wide river descent having around seven gorgeous travertine\nwaterfalls that can all be jumped. It is also a very popular tourist\nactivity, with local guides always available for hire at the base of the\nroute. Also at the base of the route are a couple restaurants, souvenir\nshops, lockers for your stuff, changing rooms, and bathrooms. At the\nparking area about 100 yds up the hill, there are more restaurants and\nshops.</p>\n<p>Feb 2022 fees (per person): 100 pesos to enter the park. 250 pesos\nfor a guide down the waterfalls (including photos).</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>After parking at the official parking lot, walk down the obvious path\nto the swimming hole village complex. Hire a guide and after changing\ninto proper gear proceed on foot for half a mile along the road and down\na set of stairs to reach the bottom of the big falls. One may also start\nthe canyon from further upstream, but then technical gear is mandatory\nto descend the big falls, unless you want to jump 80ft.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>It is recommended to visit the big falls from the bottom and explore\nthe multiple caves that hide behind its veil, they are very cool. After\nthat the descent is pretty much the same: jump, jump, jump! Some\nwaterfalls further down also have cave complexes behind them and it's\nvery interesting to explore (ask your guide to show them to you).</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>The descent terminates at the swimming hole village</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<p>The local guides will warn you must hire a guide to do the descent,\nbut this is not really enforced by any official regulation.</p>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n",
