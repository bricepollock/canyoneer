At the parking area about 100 yds up the hill, there are more restaurants and shops.\n<\/p><p>Feb 2022 fees (per person): 100 pesos to enter the park. 250 pesos for a guide down the waterfalls (including photos).\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>After parking at the official parking lot, walk down the obvious path to the swimming hole village complex.
