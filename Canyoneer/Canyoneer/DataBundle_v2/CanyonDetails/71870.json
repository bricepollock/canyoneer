that stays cool in summer and offers some excellent rock pools for swimming, sliding and jumping. \n<\/p><p>The best starting location is from the end of Cedar Creek road which is marked by a council installed private property sign and a fence. It can get pretty busy, but most people are largely here to hang out and swim at cedar creek falls a short distance up the creek.

These can easily scrambled over.\n<\/p><p>Love Creek joins from the northeast and it is best to cross over the creek and scramble up the small waterfall at this junction. Continue rock-hoping up Love Creek till you arrive at Love Creek Falls. There is a gully on the northern side of the falls (CL - creek\/true left) which can be used to reach the top of the falls. Note that there is some tricky scrambling up through here before a worn footpad contours out of the gully to the top of the falls.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>The only abseiling itself is from the top of Love Creek Falls.
