Depending on packages and specials, trips are usually a little under $100 per person.  All equipment is provided by the company, and they manage all safety aspects as well.  They will connect and disconnect all technical equipment and fireman's belays are provided on all rappels.\n<\/p><p>The best time to visit this canyon is in Costa Rica's wet season, which roughly coincides with high summer in the northern hemisphere.\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>The canyon trip begins at the Desafio building.  The drive on the dirt road to the building would require a high clearance vehicle, but Desafio offers a free shuttle service from most local hotels.  There is little to no parking at the Desafio building for non-Desafio vehicles.\n<\/p><p>Desafio will provide all necessary gear (helmet, gloves, very nice Singing Rock Sit Worker harness, steel carabiner, steel rescue 8) at their building as well as a short introduction, and then you will be shuttled to the start of the hike.  Hike 500 feet along a path to the water course.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>R1: Immediately after reaching the water course, rappel a short distance down a sloping crack\n<\/p><p>R2: Five minutes down the canyon, rappel a tall waterfall from a metal platform.  The rappel is guided, making the last section more horizontal than most rappels.  Desafio may have you let go of the rappel rope at some point and they will use a fireman's belay to control the final part of your descent.\n<\/p><p>A fun canyon section follows with a very small jump into a pool of water, followed then by a narrow down climb.  A few more minutes down canyon, there is a pool followed by a wide crack.  Desafio may have the group pause at this down climb and stack a number of guests in the crack while a guide dams up the pool above with his body.  When he releases the dam, a huge surge of water covers the people in the crack for a few seconds.\n<\/p><p><br \/>\n<\/p><p>R3: Another short distance into a crack\n<\/p><p>R4: Rappel the tallest waterfall in the canyon from a metal platform.  This rappel is guided as well, and Desafio may have you let go of the rappel line entirely for a zipline-like experience with the guide at the bottom controlling your descent with a fireman's belay.\n<\/p><p>Continue down canyon along trails out of the water course for a few more minutes until you reach the exit from the water course.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Follow the trail for approximately 100ft of elevation gain back to the Desafio building where they will serve breakfast and make their pictures available for purchase.  They will allow you to bring your own camera into the canyon.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Red_tape\">Red tape<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>This canyon is heavily improved and guided by <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http:\/\/www.desafiocostarica.com\">Desafio<\/a>.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Beta_sites\">Beta sites<\/h2><\/div>\n<ul><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http:\/\/www.desafiocostarica.com\/index.php?lang=en&amp;opt=tour&amp;id=21&amp;cat=f\">Desafio trip description<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http:\/\/brennen.caltech.edu\/swhikes\/lostcn.htm\">Chris Brennen's Adventure Hikes (Southwest)<\/a> &#160;: Piedra Canyon; La Fortuna<\/li><\/ul>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Background\">Background<\/h2><\/div>\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nParsed by mw‐api‐ext.codfw.main‐6779cc57fc‐7wmc9\nCached time: 20240914192119\nCache expiry: 2592000\nReduced expiry: false\nComplications: [show‐toc]\nCPU time usage: 0.007 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.009 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 22\/1000000\nPost‐expand include size: 0\/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 0\/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 2\/100\nExpensive parser function count: 0\/500\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0\/20\nUnstrip post‐expand size: 0\/5000000 bytes\nNumber of Wikibase entities loaded: 0\/400\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%    0.000      1 -total\n-->\n<\/div>","riskRating":null,"rappelCountMin":4,"geojson":{"type":"FeatureCollection","features":[{"properties":{"name":"Wpt1"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"coordinates":[[-84.642334,10.4285,0]],"type":"Point"}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[[-84.641167,10.434334,0]]},"properties":{"name":"Wpt2"}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"name":"Wpt3"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[[-84.765503,10.413667,0]]}},{"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[[-84.62767,10.450833,0]]},"properties":{"name":"Wpt4"},"type":"Feature"},{"properties":{"name":"Wpt5"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[[-84.641167,10.434334,0]]}},{"properties":{"name":"Wpt6"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"coordinates":[[-84.642334,10.4285,0]],"type":"Point"}},{"properties":{"name":"Wpt7"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[[-84.642334,10.4285,0]]},"type":"Feature"},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"name":"Wpt8"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[[-84.641167,10.434334,0]]}}]},"id":462,"latitude":10.4254,"months":[]}
