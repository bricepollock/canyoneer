  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>Located near <a href=\"Piedrita_Canyon\" title=\"wikilink\">Piedrita\nCanyon</a> and called Lost Canyon by <a\nhref=\"http://www.desafiocostarica.com\">Desafio Adventure Company</a>,\nthe company that guides this canyon, it is a short commercial canyon\nwith big rappels suitable for beginners who can manage their fear of\nheights.</p>\n<p>The canyon is on private property and the only way to descend it is\nto purchase a trip from the Desafio. Depending on packages and specials,\ntrips are usually a little under $100 per person. All equipment is\nprovided by the company, and they manage all safety aspects as well.\nThey will connect and disconnect all technical equipment and fireman's\nbelays are provided on all rappels.</p>\n<p>The best time to visit this canyon is in Costa Rica's wet season,\nwhich roughly coincides with high summer in the northern hemisphere.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>The canyon trip begins at the Desafio building. The drive on the dirt\nroad to the building would require a high clearance vehicle, but Desafio\noffers a free shuttle service from most local hotels. There is little to\nno parking at the Desafio building for non-Desafio vehicles.</p>\n<p>Desafio will provide all necessary gear (helmet, gloves, very nice\nSinging Rock Sit Worker harness, steel carabiner, steel rescue 8) at\ntheir building as well as a short introduction, and then you will be\nshuttled to the start of the hike. Hike 500 feet along a path to the\nwater course.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>R1: Immediately after reaching the water course, rappel a short\ndistance down a sloping crack</p>\n<p>R2: Five minutes down the canyon, rappel a tall waterfall from a\nmetal platform. The rappel is guided, making the last section more\nhorizontal than most rappels. Desafio may have you let go of the rappel\nrope at some point and they will use a fireman's belay to control the\nfinal part of your descent.</p>\n<p>A fun canyon section follows with a very small jump into a pool of\nwater, followed then by a narrow down climb. A few more minutes down\ncanyon, there is a pool followed by a wide crack. Desafio may have the\ngroup pause at this down climb and stack a number of guests in the crack\nwhile a guide dams up the pool above with his body. When he releases the\ndam, a huge surge of water covers the people in the crack for a few\nseconds.</p>\n<figure>\n<img src=\"DesafioWaterPicture.jpg\" title=\"DesafioWaterPicture.jpg\"\nwidth=\"400\" />\n<figcaption>DesafioWaterPicture.jpg</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>R3: Another short distance into a crack</p>\n<p>R4: Rappel the tallest waterfall in the canyon from a metal platform.\nThis rappel is guided as well, and Desafio may have you let go of the\nrappel line entirely for a zipline-like experience with the guide at the\nbottom controlling your descent with a fireman's belay.</p>\n<p>Continue down canyon along trails out of the water course for a few\nmore minutes until you reach the exit from the water course.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>Follow the trail for approximately 100ft of elevation gain back to\nthe Desafio building where they will serve breakfast and make their\npictures available for purchase. They will allow you to bring your own\ncamera into the canyon.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<p>This canyon is heavily improved and guided by <a\nhref=\"http://www.desafiocostarica.com\">Desafio</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a\nhref=\"http://www.desafiocostarica.com/index.php?lang=en&amp;opt=tour&amp;id=21&amp;cat=f\">Desafio\ntrip description</a></li>\n<li><img src=\"rwl_en.png\" title=\"rwl_en.png\" alt=\"rwl_en.png\" /><a\nhref=\"http://brennen.caltech.edu/swhikes/lostcn.htm\">Chris Brennen's\nAdventure Hikes (Southwest)</a> : Piedra Canyon; La Fortuna</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n",
