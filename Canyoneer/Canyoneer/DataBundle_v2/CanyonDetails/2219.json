It has 1-2 rappels, and some easy bushwhacking. This is not a major destination.\n<\/p>\n<ul><li>Babyshoe can also be used as an alternate entry to <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http:\/\/ropewiki.com\/Lewis_River\">Lewis River<\/a> - although be aware when Babyshoe has good water, the upper Lewis may be quite high.<\/li>\n<li>The watershed is 0.6mi^2. It is likely fed by springs in a swampy area to the northeast. With a smaller watershed, it's often open for business earlier than other creeks in the area.<\/li><\/ul>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>From the junction of FR-90 and FR-23, follow FR-23 north for 2.7mi to where Babyshoe Creek passes underneath the road in a culvert. Find a good place to park nearby.\n<\/p><p>Follow the east side of Babyshoe Creek for about 0.13mi before dropping in just above the technical section.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<ul><li>R1: 50ft from tree.

Make your way downstream until you can easily exit up the embankment on the DCL \/ east side. From here, there are several options:\n<\/p><p>1) Continue downhill through open forest, following the path of least resistance to intersect the <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http:\/\/ropewiki.com\/Lewis_River\">Lewis River<\/a> a few hundred yards above R2. Note that the water will triple or more upon entering the Lewis River. Depending on where you come out, you might need to do a short nuisance rappel into the creek.\n<\/p><p>2) No shuttle: Hike back up to the road (~0.25mi,  300ft) to your car.\n<\/p><p>3) Shuttle: Contour east about 0.25mi ( 100ft) to the road. Your exit will be near the typical entrance of the Lewis River. From here, it's 0.6mi shuttle back to the top of Babyshoe.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Red_tape\">Red tape<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>None.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Beta_sites\">Beta sites<\/h2><\/div>\n<ul><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20210527212206\/www.canyoneeringnorthwest.com\/BabyShoe\">CanyoneeringNorthwest.com (archive.org)<\/a> &#160;: Babyshoe Creek<\/li><\/ul>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Background\">Background<\/h2><\/div>\n\n\n<\/div>","months":["Jul","May","Jun"],"waterRating":"C","rappelCountMin":1,"rappelLongestMeters":45.72,"url":"https:\/\/ropewiki.com\/Babyshoe_Creek","id":2219,"version":"c0b77154f49ad6b9c780b969eec39d8f8f97b5a694c5d9541a1c898a4878218b","riskRating":null,"geojson":{"type":"FeatureCollection","features":[{"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[[-121.61382436752321,46.255045631983386,0]]},"type":"Feature","properties":{"name":"Enter Lewis River"}},{"geometry":{"coordinates":[[-121.61440372467042,46.25807598412969,0],[-121.61435536108911,46.257617918386245,0],[-121.61428034305574,46.257378684148954,0],[-121.614146232605,46.25713759432674,0],[-121.61409250460565,46.256816757765606,0],[-121.61409786902368,46.256813048661435,0],[-121.61412469111383,46.25660904754583,0],[-121.61412469111383,46.25660904754583,0],[-121.61411404609682,46.25643657328328,0],[-121.61411140141038,46.25638840269438,0]],"type":"LineString"},"properties":{"stroke":"#FF0000","name":"Descent"},"type":"Feature"},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"coordinates":[[-121.61308944225313,46.25965971231445,0],[-121.61335766315462,46.259251730505184,0],[-121.6134810447693,46.258992104136915,0],[-121.61375999450685,46.258751021408465,0],[-121.61388337612154,46.2585062286304,0],[-121.61404967308046,46.25828368879291,0],[-121.61435544490816,46.25811678332207,0]],"type":"LineString"},"properties":{"stroke":"#00CD00","name":"Approach"}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"coordinates":[[-121.61411140141038,46.25638840269438,0],[-121.61385655403139,46.25617322443806,0],[-121.61351323127748,46.25582456345791,0],[-121.61371707916261,46.2552756033793,0],[-121.61378145217897,46.255067887321914,0]],"type":"LineString"},"properties":{"stroke":"#FF0000","name":"Continue to Lewis River"}},{"properties":{"name":"Exit (no shuttle)","stroke":"#A200FF"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"LineString","coordinates":[[-121.6140925884247,46.25639577284076,0],[-121.61388874053956,46.25649221020143,0],[-121.61375999450685,46.256603483868396,0],[-121.61364197731018,46.25701890356336,0],[-121.61344885826112,46.25743432011123,0],[-121.6130840778351,46.25781264315775,0],[-121.61250472068788,46.25810936528935,0],[-121.6119682788849,46.25840608581529,0],[-121.61197022009983,46.2584052421928,0],[-121.61212,46.25857,0],[-121.61224,46.25883,0],[-121.61223999999999,46.25909595428838,0],[-121.61223999999997,46.259095954831736,0],[-121.61224,46.25932,0],[-121.61229,46.25946,0],[-121.61258,46.25965,0],[-121.61279,46.25972,0],[-121.61297,46.25972,0],[-121.61312571160639,46.25969323706766,0]]}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"coordinates":[[-121.61407113075258,46.25641802763134,0],[-121.61400675773622,46.25638835457522,0],[-121.61254763603212,46.25629191703189,0],[-121.61131381988527,46.25621773419085,0],[-121.61035895347597,46.256039694962915,0],[-121.60940408706666,46.255876491829504,0],[-121.60855650901796,46.25572070656724,0]],"type":"LineString"},"properties":{"name":"Exit (shuttle)","stroke":"#009AFF"}}]}}
