This is not a major destination.\n<\/p>\n<ul><li>Babyshoe can also be used as an alternate entry to <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http:\/\/ropewiki.com\/Lewis_River\">Lewis River<\/a> - although be aware when Babyshoe has good water, the upper Lewis may be quite high.<\/li>\n<li>The watershed is 0.6mi^2.

Note that the water will triple or more upon entering the Lewis River. Depending on where you come out, you might need to do a short nuisance rappel into the creek.\n<\/p><p>2) No shuttle: Hike back up to the road (~0.25mi,  300ft) to your car.\n<\/p><p>3) Shuttle: Contour east about 0.25mi ( 100ft) to the road. Your exit will be near the typical entrance of the Lewis River.
