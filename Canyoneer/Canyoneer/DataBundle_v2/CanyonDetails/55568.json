Beautiful waterfalls and a set of mini-narrows make for great photos. Plenty of natural anchor options to put you in or out of the flow. A great canyon for beginners. \n<\/p><p>This creek is best run in early to mid-summer. Water levels typically become very low by the end of the season.\n<\/p><p>Pair with nearby Dark Creek or East Canyon Creek for a full day of canyoning.\n<\/p>\n<ul><li>Watershed: 3.45mi^2.<\/li><\/ul>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Turn onto NF-2325 on the south side of NF-23. Cross the bridge over East Canyon Creek. Just past the large clearing on your left, take a right on the dirt road heading up the hill. Continue for several minutes until the road ends abruptly at a campsite. Park here for the exit. \n<\/p><p>Take a shuttle back down the dirt road, make a right, and continue for about 2.5 miles. Park your vehicle where the road crosses a stream.  Just before the stream is a pullout with room for several vehicles.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Drop directly into the stream from the road, or head down the forest beside the stream for a short distance, dropping in as preferred when the brush gets too thick.\n<\/p><p>Follow the stream for .25 miles until the convergence with Prairie Creek. There is one small drop on this stream that may require a handline or rappel from a small tree on DCL.\n<\/p><p><b>R1<\/b>: Rappel 35' off a tree on DCR. \n<\/p><p><b>Downclimb<\/b>: Downclimb the large logjam.\n<\/p><p><b>R2<\/b>: The Mini-Narrows: Rappel 15' to a logjam.\n<\/p><p>- High flow: Rappel off of a boulder on DCL. This boulder is about 10' back from the lip of the drop, and makes for an awkward pull around the corner. It is advised to do a test pull before the last person down.\n<\/p><p>- Moderate to low flow: It is possible to set up an anchor off of the logjam DCR and rappel directly through the flow, also making for an easier pull.\n<\/p><p>- Downclimb the logjam just below the rappel to complete the sequence. It is very slippery, so use caution.\n<\/p><p><b>R3<\/b>: Rappel 35' from a tree DCL.\n<\/p><p><b>Jump<\/b>: 10' into a shallow pool. Be sure to send someone to check pool for depth\/debris before jumping.  Low water:  build a cairn to rappel.\n<\/p><p><b>R4<\/b>: High water:  Rappel 45' from a tree DCL.  Low water: build an anchor in the watercourse to run the flow directly.  Took us about 80ft of rope per the horizontal distance.\n<\/p><p><b>R5<\/b>: The Dragon's Lair: This is a beautiful drop into a cool room set back in the rock. High water:  bypass this drop.  Low water:  Anchor on a large log set well back creek-center.  Need about 70ft of rope per the horizontal distance.  Great rappel.\n<\/p><p><b>Downclimb<\/b> Short downclimb under some logs to complete the technical part of the canyon.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>After the last drop, there will be around a half hour of slippery creekwalking and logjam navigating. Soon you'll come to a significant logjam in the creek. The creek takes a sharp right after this logjam. Around 100' further downstream, cut up into the brush on CR.  Expect some bushwhacking.  Once it flattens out a bit, parallel the creek for a few minutes. You'll eventually come across a clearing that is an extension of the old road where you parked your shuttle vehicle. Although overgrown, it's easy walking back to the vehicle.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Red_tape\">Red tape<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>None.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Beta_sites\">Beta sites<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Background\">Background<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>First descent by Jake Huddleston and Michael Henson on 6\/15\/2019.\n<\/p>\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nParsed by mw‐api‐ext.codfw.main‐6779cc57fc‐tc8p5\nCached time: 20240914192113\nCache expiry: 2592000\nReduced expiry: false\nComplications: [show‐toc]\nCPU time usage: 0.005 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.007 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 21\/1000000\nPost‐expand include size: 0\/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 0\/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 2\/100\nExpensive parser function count: 0\/500\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0\/20\nUnstrip post‐expand size: 0\/5000000 bytes\nNumber of Wikibase entities loaded: 0\/400\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%    0.000      1 -total\n-->\n<\/div>"}
