  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>The lower technical portion of the Kaweah, while maybe not quite as\nridiculously cool as the upper part, is still really beautiful, with\nsome definite technical challenge, and great slides and jumps.</p>\n<p>It is low elevation, and warm. In hot summer days, you can do it\nwithout a wet suit, which is kind of awesome.</p>\n<p>Also, it makes for a great multiday trip when you combine it with the\n<a href=\"North_Fork_Kaweah_River_(Upper)\" title=\"wikilink\">Upper North\nFork</a>, and perhaps <a href=\"Stony_Creek\" title=\"wikilink\">Stony\nCreek</a> above that.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>Leave one car at the end of North Fork drive, (way up a curvy road\nfrom Three Rivers)</p>\n<p>Drive up Dry Creek road from Generals Highway and follow the signs to\nHartland. A mile or two before Hartland, take Pierce Valley road up on\nthe right to Eshom Point OHV (this land mark can be input on your\nfavorite navigation app). You have cell service here before descending\nthe forest service road down to Cherry Flats.</p>\n<p>As you drive up Pierce Valley road into Eshom Point OHV veer left on\ntop of the hill to continue off the other side of the ridge. Next\nintersection take a left on the dirt road that contours along. I'd find\nsomewhere to park here, but you can keep driving all the way down to\nCherry Flats. The dirt road is easily traveled by 4x4's or a spirited\ndriver in something akin to a Subaru Forester.</p>\n<p>Maybe 4 or 5 miles out on this road it drops down a ridge and you hit\nan intersection where a road goes left and one goes straight down the\nridge. Head straight, it will dead end quickly. Up ahead at the dead\nend, what looks kind of like a drainage ditch is actually a trail, and\nwill be fairly obvious once you get onto it. There is poison oak, you\ncannot avoid it.</p>\n<p>From Eshom Point OHV at the top driving down to Cherry Flats (where\nthe trail starts) takes about 45 minutes one way. You will be driving\nslow due to the overgrown vegetation attempting to give you beautiful\nmanzanita pinstripes. Those driving the entire road in early season\nshould expect downed trees or washed out deep ruts.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>The trail drops you out at the confluence of the North Fork and\nRedwood Creek. Just downstream the canyon starts with a 10 or 15 foot\njump off a waterfall into a nice kind of grotto. Further down more jumps\nand slides await.</p>\n<p>The technical portion becomes obvious and everything drops off down\nbelow you.</p>\n<p>There are a few bolts for the first (two staged) rappel just right of\nthe water course on top of the drop which are a bit terrifying to get\nto. These rappels keep you out of the water, and are okay with a decent\namount of flow.</p>\n<p>A short drop off I think a single bolt follows. This puts you into a\nslot with some boulders jammed in. If you have any doubts about the\nflow, you can climb out on the left before the next drop, walk\ndownstream on the left and scope things out. Otherwise you can rappel\noff these rocks (you'll probably need to build an anchor, as the water\ntears everything in here up). If it looks bad, just bypass everything on\nthe right, and find somewhere to rappel off the side of the final\nwaterfall.</p>\n<p>A little bit down from here you hit a rappel off of a tree on the\nleft of a waterfall. The next drop looks maybe downclimbable, but it is\nreally slick, so probably not. Also, the water all drives under a rock\nright after it. When I did it, I slipped, and slid under the rock and\nout the other side. It was pretty fun, but if the water was higher, you\nmight die. Something to consider?</p>\n<p>After this one final rappel down a big beautiful waterfall of 100\nfeet or so into a wide pool finishes the technical portion.</p>\n<p>The fun is not entirely over though. I could see some people seeing\nthe next part as a slog, but I think it's mostly pretty great. There are\nmore slots, some you climb down, others have big waterfalls. Most\nwaterfalls are bypassed on the left, often by jumping back into the pool\nat the bottom. Lots of swimming, your arms may get tired.</p>\n<p>As it starts to get more sloggy, you will see old rock work from an\nirrigation pipe. A little while later there is a really fun low angle\nslide of 15 feet or so where it is obviously important to do the slide\non the left. Stop and play here as long as you like, it's time to get\nout of the river now.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>After playing in the slide, make your way up the steep grassy ridge\non the left (east). Bushwhacking is not terrible for the vast majority\nof the way up, until you get to the very end, at which point you may be\nbelly crawling. Don't worry though, the trail is close!</p>\n<p>Except maybe you should worry, because the trail is not maintained,\nand is equally bushwhacky in spots. Sorry? After the first mile and a\nhalf or so it gets better. 6 miles total down to your car, it takes a\nwhile, and will probably be unpleasantly hot. There is not necessarily\nany water available, without bushwhacking back down to the creek. Once\nyou are quite close to your car, another path from Yucca Creek comes in\nfrom the left. Another quarter mile down or so, you cross a bridge and\ncome back up to the end of North Fork Drive and your car!</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<p>There is an alternate exit on the East that is shorter and on a dirt\nroad that goes back to pavement. However, this is a private road and\nusing it without permission would be trespassing. Please don't do that,\nit's not good for canyoneers to be caught trespassing. If you want to\nuse this road try to contact the owner and get proper permission,\notherwise stick to the official exit.</p>\n<p>You can actually do this as a loop, and it is far more pleasant. At\nthe slide, if you go up the right (west) side you will find an old road,\nwhich can be connected to dirt roads to loop around nicely back up to\nyour car. This is all private property, so you shouldn't do it. But you\ncould. ;)</p>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<p>Dumping this description of lower waterpark from Daniel Elson:</p>\n<p>I have a very clear memory of lower’s most technical section(starting\nat pic 88):</p>\n<p>slide, slide, jump, 10’ rap, “theoretically” scramble around DCL and\nslide right next to the waterfall, then 3 more slides(?),</p>\n<p>THEN sketchy slide rick and I did unroped and we set up a hand line\nthat we also used to rappel the two stage thru the sieve. In lower flow\nthat hand-line wouldn’t be necessary, and it is probably a jump DCL and\nthen a slide under the rock sieve.</p>\n<p>After that is a big waterfall (bolts DCL) that you can jump or slide\nfrom the halfway point.</p>\n<p>That’s pretty much the entire technical section and pretty badass.\nOne of my favorite all time sequences. Right before it there was a slide\nunderneath a fallen tree.</p>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n",
