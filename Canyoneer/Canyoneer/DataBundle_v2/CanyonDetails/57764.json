  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>This via ferrata shows up in several promotional ads for the area. It\nis by far the worst via ferrata I've ever done. It took 10 min to climb\nto the top, and 5 min to walk down. Furthermore, they won't let you do\nit without a guide (lol!). Even though I had all my personal climbing\ngear along with me. I poached it when no-one was looking.</p>\n<p>The park does exist up a very pretty river valley however, and has\none potential interesting attraction -- a cave through trip. There is\nlodging here and it would be a nice place to stay, just not to go to for\nthe via ferrata.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n"
