A popular trail\nnetwork circles / descends the canyon.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>As of 2022: the upper suspension bridge has been closed limiting\noptions to an out &amp; back on either side of the loop.</li>\n<li>The trail has been closed periodically due to flood damage or\nslides. Please respect all closures.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<p>Please resist the temptation to run Lava Canyon. Off-trail travel is\nprohibited here as there have been numerous fatalities. This area is\nalso a high-tourist zone and is extremely popular. Individuals climbing,\nrappelling, or slack-lining around such \"show waterfalls\" are far more\nlikely to garner negative reactions from the general public at large.\nNegative reactions can lead to complaints, which means more rules for\ncanyoneers by local land managers.</p>\n<p>A NW Forest Pass is required to park at the trailhead.</p>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a\nhref=\"https://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/giffordpinchot/recarea/?recid=41610\">Forest\nService</a></li>\n<li><a\nhref=\"https://www.waterfallsnorthwest.com/waterfall/Lava-Canyon-Falls-5272\">NW\nWaterfall Survey</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n",
