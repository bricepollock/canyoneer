Ashton Canyon is packed full with big drops and rooster tails galore. It's set in a beautiful basin encompassed by more waterfalls and will likely check most of the boxes of what most canyoneers want in a canyon. Most rappels in this canyon require the use of a traverse line and require side stepping the waterflow. The canyon also uses v-threads &amp; petzl pulse holes for anchors -- be sure to read the caution notes and beta. In the couple of years since the canyon was opened the bushwack section of the approach has improved, with a faint route to follow through the cut-back vegetation.\n<\/p><p><br \/>\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading3\"><h3 id=\"Snow_Pack\">Snow Pack<\/h3><\/div>\n<p>The highlight features of this canyon are dependent on the flow. Early in the season special aquatic hazards will exist. Late in the season the canyon will still be fine to run, but the highlight features will be missing. The reference photos below are from satellite imagery of the drainage above Ashton.

Take a left (traveling south) on 387th Ave NE (convenient gas station &amp; store on the corner) and drive for 0.5 miles until the paved road ends. Take a sharp right turn onto a dirt and gravel road, it may feel like someone's driveway, but continue a short distance until you reach the Neiderprum Trailhead [48.25949, -121.70892]. The parking area can easily fit 5-7 cars.  \n<\/p><p><b>Hike<\/b>: Follow the well established trail for 2 miles until you reach an old limestone mine on the right (worth exploring on the way back), and Ashton Creek on the left. The water flow reference picture is taken here. From the stream bed, look right for a faint trail leading up the stream. As the trees thin out your eyes will be drawn upwards to the sub-peaks of Whitehorse Mountain, their slopes littered with streams &amp; waterfalls. The stream bed will lead you to the base of Ashton Canyon, and the foot of R8. Enjoy the buffet of thimble berries and the largest salmon berries you've ever seen.\n<\/p><p><i>Top Tip:<\/i> leave some beverages to cool in the pools here, and enjoy them upon your victorious competition of the canyon before the mellow hike out.\n<\/p><p><b>Bushwhack<\/b>: Scramble up the rock slabs to the left (looking upstream) until you reach the top of R8. Proceed uphill into the brush following a faint semi-established route, until you reach the cliff band. Follow the cliff to the right with the aim of reaching a boulder field that is visible via satellite imagery. At ~1,780' elevation, make your way down through the brush to reach the top of the first rappel. There is ample room to suit up here.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p><b>CAUTION:<\/b>\n<\/p>\n<ul><li>Do not underestimate the technical rope work and team sequencing needed for this canyon. Your entire team should be comfortable navigating rooster tails and water chutes in slippery conditions. Rope and pack management are important.  Belays are not always possible. Be sure to check pool depth for hazards (e.g. logs, boulders, and shallow pools) prior to sliding and jumping.<\/li><\/ul>\n<ul><li>This canyon utilizes v-threads (aka rock threads) for traverse line anchors and rappelling anchors. Treat these as marginal anchors and use appropriate techniques to back them up (e.g. human anchors, removable bolts, etc). The cordage is made from 5 mm pure dyneema and tied off using a triple fisherman's bend. The 8 mm Petzl pulse can be used for the backup removable bolt.<\/li><\/ul>\n<ul><li>There are traverses in the canyon which should be rigged for retrieval via self-belay or team belay techniques.
