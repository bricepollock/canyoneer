  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>Rooster, Rooster, Rooster, PEACOCK! Ashton Canyon is packed full with\nbig drops and rooster tails galore. It's set in a beautiful basin\nencompassed by more waterfalls and will likely check most of the boxes\nof what most canyoneers want in a canyon. Most rappels in this canyon\nrequire the use of a traverse line and require side stepping the\nwaterflow. The canyon also uses v-threads for anchors -- be sure to read\nthe caution notes and beta. If you've run Wellman Basin, the bushwhack\nis similar (so not good) but shorter and possible a bit thornier...no\nthanks to the Hawthorn brush for making an appearance.</p>\n<h3 id=\"snow_pack\">Snow Pack</h3>\n<p>The highlight features of this canyon are dependent on the flow.\nEarly in the season special aquatic hazards will exist. Late in the\nseason the canyon will still be fine to run, but the highlight features\nwill be missing. The reference photos below are from satellite imagery\nof the drainage above Ashton. These images come from the <a\nhref=\"https://blog.caltopo.com/2019/06/26/sentinel-satellite-imagery/\">\"Sentinel\nWeekly\" layer of Caltopo</a>. The images are displayed using the \"false\ncolor green\" filter in order to distinguish snow (light blue) from cloud\n(white). If you don't have a paid-for caltopo account, you can also\nbrowser the imagery on the <a\nhref=\"https://apps.sentinel-hub.com/eo-browser/\">Sentinel Hub</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p><strong>Drive</strong>: From Darrington, drive west on State Route\n530 for 5 miles. Take a left (traveling south) on 387th Ave NE\n(convenient gas station &amp; store on the corner) and drive for 0.5\nmiles until the paved road ends. Take a sharp right turn onto a dirt and\ngravel road, it may feel like someone's driveway, but continue a short\ndistance until you reach the Neiderprum Trailhead [48.25949,\n-121.70892]. The parking area can easily fit 5-7 cars.</p>\n<p><strong>Hike</strong>: Follow the well established trail for 2 miles\nuntil you reach an old limestone mine on the right (worth exploring on\nthe way back), and Ashton Creek on the left. The water flow reference\npicture is taken here. From the stream bed, look right for a faint trail\nleading up the stream. As the trees thin out your eyes will be drawn\nupwards to the sub-peaks of Whitehorse Mountain, their slopes littered\nwith streams &amp; waterfalls. The stream bed will lead you to the base\nof Ashton Canyon, and the foot of R8. Enjoy the buffet of thimble\nberries and the largest salmon berries you've ever seen.</p>\n<p><em>Top Tip:</em> leave some beverages to cool in the pools here, and\nenjoy them upon your victorious competition of the canyon before the\nmellow hike out.</p>\n<p><strong>Bushwhack</strong>: Scramble up the rock slabs to the left\n(looking upstream) until you reach the top of R8. Proceed uphill into\nthe brush until you reach the cliff band. Follow the cliff with the aim\nof reaching a boulder field that is visible via satellite imagery. At\n~1,780' elevation, make your way down through the brush to reach the top\nof the first rappel. There is ample room to suit up here.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p><strong>CAUTION:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Do not underestimate the technical rope work and team sequencing\nneeded for this canyon. Your entire team should be comfortable\nnavigating rooster tails and water chutes in slippery conditions. Rope\nand pack management are important. Belays are not always possible. Be\nsure to check pool depth for hazards (e.g. logs, boulders, and shallow\npools) prior to sliding and jumping.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>This canyon utilizes v-threads (aka rock threads) for traverse line\nanchors and rappelling anchors. Treat these as marginal anchors and use\nappropriate techniques to back them up (e.g. human anchors, removable\nbolts, etc). The cordage is made from 5 mm pure dyneema and tied off\nusing a triple fisherman's bend. The 8 mm Petzl pulse can be used for\nthe backup removable bolt.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>There are traverses in the canyon which should be rigged for\nretrieval via self-belay or team belay techniques. Do not leave fixed\nlines in the canyon.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>R1 + traverse:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Traverse: 10’ DCL from small tree. Utilize a traverse line to reach\nR1 -- the floor is unstable and it is easy to accidentally dislodge\nrocks.</li>\n<li>Rappel (R1): 170’ DCL from v-thread. The v-thread can be backed-up\nusing a removable bolt. Be careful of an abrasion point on the 2nd lip\n(15-20ft down), very sharp.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>R2 + traverse:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Traverse: DCR 10' from bolted traverse line anchor</li>\n<li>Rappel (R2): DCL 130' from v-thread. The v-thread can be backed-up\nusing a removable bolt</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>R3 + traverse:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Traverse: DCR 15' from v-thread. The v-thread is at ground level in\nthe center of the canyon</li>\n<li>Rappel (R3): DCL 110' from unlinked bolts. In higher flow, the\nrooster can be side-stepped from DCL to DCR</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>R4</strong>: DCL 25' from v-thread. The v-thread can be\nbacked-up using a removable bolt</p>\n<p><strong>R5 + traverse:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Traverse: DCR 10' from v-thread traverse line anchor</li>\n<li>Rappel (R5): DCR 50' from v-thread. This waterfall concentrates into\na funnel and ends in a turbulent pool. In higher flow the water is\nstronger on DCR and in the center of the pool so landing in the calmer\nwater (DCL) is a more pleasant experience.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>R6:</strong> DCL 15' from single bolt or 10' very shallow\njump from chockstone [<strong>2023:</strong> this bolt is damaged, so\nshould be treated as marginal, and replaced]</p>\n<p><strong>R7</strong>: DCR 60' from single bolt. The waterfall forms an\nimpressive S-shaped rooster tail. This waterfall can be bypassed on\ncanyon left</p>\n<p><strong>R8 + traverse:</strong> This waterfall can be bypassed.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Traverse: DCL 10' from v-thread traverse line anchor</li>\n<li>Rappel (R8): DCL 90' from single bolt anchor. This isn't an ordinary\nrooster tail, this is a damn peacock tail. The water concentrates about\n15' down -- jump over this (in whichever way you are able) to DCL and\nprepare to be engulfed inside the most impressive waterfall bubble.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>Eat more berries. Proceed downstream and follow the faint trail DCL\nuntil you reach the main trail. Walk the 2 miles back to your cars.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<p>None</p>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<p><a\nhref=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/pnwcanyoning/posts/10160145777245789\">https://www.facebook.com/groups/pnwcanyoning/posts/10160145777245789</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n<p>Ashton Canyon was first descended on July 30, 2022 by Andrew\nHumphreys, Jake Huddleston, Kevin Steffa, Mike Peterson, Ryan Ernst,\nHaruka-James Lipscomb and Tiffanie Lin. We found webbing near R1 --\nperhaps left from ice climbers or are a very secretive canyoneer. While\nthe rest of Seattle baked in 90F+ weather, Ashton was the perfect\nretreat from the heat and might be the one of the few (if only) times\nwhere the water temps weren't freezing in the PNW.</p>\n",
