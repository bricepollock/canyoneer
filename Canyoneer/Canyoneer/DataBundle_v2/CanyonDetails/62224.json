  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>Hawthorn Creek is one of numerous drainages on the north side of the\nbulky Mount Pilchuck. Unassuming on topographic maps, a quick look\neither upstream or downstream from the road to the Mt. Pilchuck\nTrailhead (which the creek crosses) will reveal some of its canyoneering\npotential. Other than the unfortunate state of the Mt. Pilchuck Road,\nthe approach is simple and quick, and the drainage itself is beautiful -\nit feels like a canyon in a lot of places but is still easily exited at\nseveral points if one does not want to do the entire descent. While many\nof the rappels are fairly short, there are quite a few of them and you\nare never far from the next one during the descent. This creek also\nfeatures some surprisingly deep pools for its size. The creek bed itself\nis fairly narrow , with the lips of several of the drops forming an even\nnarrower, constricted space, so parts of it will be more hazardous or\npossibly impassable at high water levels.</p>\n<p><img src=\"Hawthorn_intro4.JPG\" title=\"Hawthorn_intro4.JPG\"\nwidth=\"200\" alt=\"Hawthorn_intro4.JPG\" /> <img src=\"Hawthorn_intro1.JPG\"\ntitle=\"Hawthorn_intro1.JPG\" width=\"112\" alt=\"Hawthorn_intro1.JPG\" />\n<img src=\"Hawthorn_intro2.JPG\" title=\"Hawthorn_intro2.JPG\" width=\"112\"\nalt=\"Hawthorn_intro2.JPG\" /> <img src=\"Hawthorn_intro5.JPG\"\ntitle=\"Hawthorn_intro5.JPG\" width=\"116\" alt=\"Hawthorn_intro5.JPG\" />\n<img src=\"Hawthorn_intro3.JPG\" title=\"Hawthorn_intro3.JPG\" width=\"200\"\nalt=\"Hawthorn_intro3.JPG\" /></p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>Drive the Mountain Loop Highway (SR 92) to the well signed and well\nused Mt. Pilchuck Road, just east of Blue Bridge (road bridge over the\nSouth Fork of the Stillaguamish River).</p>\n<p>As of June 2021, the state of Mt Pilchuck road has continued to\ndeteriorate. Without at least moderate clearance you can expected a slow\n&amp; annoying drive with likely scrapes to the underside of your\nvehicle.</p>\n<p>Continue for 3.8 miles to where the road crosses Hawthorn Creek.\nParking for several vehicles is available just uphill of the stream\ncrossing.</p>\n<p>Walk back down the road 150' or so until you see the easy, non\nbrushy, not too steep way uphill on the left of the canyon (DCR). (Jun\n2021 - there's a piece or pink marker tape, followed by a very short but\nsteep climb into the more open forest).</p>\n<p>Ascend open forest, generally staying near the drainage. You can also\nlook into the drainage at several points during the ascent if you\nwish.</p>\n<p>At elevation 2490', turn toward the creek, and join it where it\nleaves out. The first rappel should be just downstream of this point,\nnear a very large overhead tree trunk.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>A few of these rappels can likely be downclimbed in lower water\nlevels.</p>\n<p><strong>R1</strong>: 30' off a tree DCR or DCL into a cool chasm with\na giant tree trunk above spanning the drainage (photo below). Even in\nlow flow the pool under the log is surprisingly deep in its center\n(&gt;6ft). A carefully planned &amp; depth checked jump is possible.</p>\n<figure>\n<img src=\"Hawthorn_r1.JPG\" title=\"Hawthorn_r1.JPG\" width=\"200\" />\n<figcaption>Hawthorn_r1.JPG</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p><strong>R2</strong>: 10' from dead tree DCR (photo below).

Some careful footwork can keep you clear of the flow all the\nway to the bottom. If not so careful end up finishing in a nice pummel\nat the base of this very narrow waterfall.</li>\n<li><em>Wet:</em> DCL, step down towards lip of waterfall. Webbing on\nmassive overhead log provides a line in the flow. When the canyon is\nrunning moderate-low this is fun, and this rap is probably the highest\nflow part.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"Hawthorn_r4_top.JPG\" title=\"Awkward start of the dry route\"\nwidth=\"354\" alt=\"Awkward start of the dry route\" /> </p>\n<p><strong>R5:</strong> 75' off a tree DCL (photo below). Out of the\nflow options exist further into the trees.</p>\n<p><img src=\"Hawthorn_r5.JPG\" title=\"Hawthorn_r5.JPG\" width=\"200\"\nalt=\"Hawthorn_r5.JPG\" /> </p>\n<p><strong>R6:</strong> 25' rappel off tree DCR through a veil of\nhorizontally sluicing water (photo below). You can easily avoid this\nrappel by scrambling a bit further DCR, but why would you???</p>\n<figure>\n<img src=\"Hawthorn_r6.png\" title=\"Hawthorn_r6.png\" width=\"350\" />\n<figcaption>Hawthorn_r6.png</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p><strong>R7:</strong> 25' off a tree trunk laying perpendicular to the\nwater flow (photo below)</p>\n<p><img src=\"Hawthorn_r7_top.JPG\" title=\"Hawthorn_r7_top.JPG\"\nwidth=\"220\" alt=\"Hawthorn_r7_top.JPG\" /> <img\nsrc=\"Hawthorn_r7_bottom.JPG\" title=\"Hawthorn_r7_bottom.JPG\" width=\"200\"\nalt=\"Hawthorn_r7_bottom.JPG\" /></p>\n<p><strong>R8:</strong> 40' off tree DCR (photo below)</p>\n<figure>\n<img src=\"Hawthorn_r8.JPG\" title=\"Hawthorn_r8.JPG\" width=\"200\" />\n<figcaption>Hawthorn_r8.JPG</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p><strong>R9:</strong> 40' off bolts DCR (photo below)</p>\n<figure>\n<img src=\"Hawthorn_r9.JPG\" title=\"Hawthorn_r9.JPG\" width=\"200\" />\n<figcaption>Hawthorn_r9.JPG</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p><strong>R10:</strong> 60' off small tree DCL before the end of the\npool from R9 (photo below). Dry options exist further into the trees\nDCL, but which still drop you into the variable depth pool.</p>\n<figure>\n<img src=\"Hawthorn_r10.JPG\" title=\"Hawthorn_r10.JPG\" width=\"200\" />\n<figcaption>Hawthorn_r10.JPG</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<h3 id=\"bonus_rappel\">Bonus Rappel</h3>\n<p>From the road you can glimpse a curious chasm with diagonal walls.\nThis is bonus rappel, and potentially the highlight of the route.</p>\n<p><strong>R11:</strong> 100' DCL from tree.</p>\n<p><u>Access</u>: Either scramble down from the bridge, or more\nadventitiously via the culvert under the road. The culvert and rappel\nseem to attract high flow, so it likely only possible when the whole\ncanyon is running at moderate-low levels.</p>\n<p><u>Exit</u></p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Fixed line:</em> with a little pre-planning you can drop a rope\ndown the well defined drainage just DCL of the bottom pool. This can be\nused as a fixed line to ascend the steep drainage safely. Requires the\ntechnical know-how to ascend effectively.</li>\n<li><em>Scramble:</em> from the base of the rappel, climb down the creek\na little further and scramble DCR up into the trees, gaining the ridge\nand better footing. Flow the trees back round to the road.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>The exit from R10 is obvious and very short.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n<p>This canyon was first attempted a couple of years ago by Heath\nUncapher, Cassandra Sipe, and Yana Radenska. Only one rappel was\ncompleted at the time, currently rappel 4. The first descent was on\nOctober 24, 2020, by Alec Wagner, Beth Voss, Ryan Fleming, and Yana\nRadenska.</p>\n",
