dir=\"ltr\"><p>Springdell Cascade is nothing new. &#160;Ice climbers have probably been on the wall for 20  years and it is apparent once you get up top. &#160;However, after first seeing the falls and dabbling in the area back in 2014, a recent drive by had me curious to explore a little higher and find a way into the drainage to explore a bit more. &#160;With a few hours to spare before I met up with a buddy to explore elsewhere, I decided to solo up to the area and make my way.\n<\/p><p><b>NOTE: &#160;This area is frequently visited by ice-climbers and should be respected. &#160;Do not remove anchors\/gear!!<\/b>&#160;\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>From Provo Canyon, just past Canyon Glen (and prior to Nunns Park\/Bridal Veil turnoff) there is a small pull out on the right where you see the dirt road come in. &#160;I do not advise parking here, and rather you should park at Nunns Park\/Bridal Veil and walk down. &#160;When I returned to my car at the end of the day, a police officer had marked my car as if it had been abandoned. &#160;Whoops! &#160;Parking at Nunns\/BV and taking the Bonneville Shoreline Trail will only be an extra 0.4 mi and 50' of gain. &#160;Best to be safe and park in an actual parking lot.\nOnce on the Shoreline Trail, you will come to your first noticeable left hand turn up a trail (east) that heads up to Springdell Cascade. &#160;Upon reaching the Cascade (before going up to it), you have 2 options. &#160;If you contour around to the south and stay on the trail, you'll find a great fire pit and will soon lose the trail. &#160;In the first attempt to get higher in the drainage, I explored up the cliff bands for about a mile\/1000' and came back around into the upper drainage (NOT RECOMMENDED). &#160;Getting to the upper section required steep screes, free climbing exposed rock (5.7), and isn't worth the effort for the extra 30' and 60' rappels. &#160;\n<\/p><p>The recommended route is to hike up to the cascade once you see it. &#160;To the right of the waterfall you will see anchored in cables with a tag that says \"warning\/climbers only\", or something of that sort. &#160;I advise putting on your harness and safety tether at this point to make the climb up to the top. &#160;Gain the 50' up to the wall, and then traverse along the lines (cable\/rope) around the rock to the ridge. &#160;The cables then go vertical-ish for 100' or so. &#160;Clip in past every anchor, make sure you have secure hands and feet, and please stagger people on your approach as there is loose rock everywhere. &#160;Once you top out at the end of the cables, contour to your left over to the Cascade. &#160;You will find more cables to clip into along with some remnants of ice-climbing anchors (please leave them intact). &#160;Drop down to the watercourse and you're there.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>For the recommended descent of the Springdell Cascade, you will notice a few anchors up top that you can get to.\n<\/p>\n<ul><li>1: Slung trees\/roots LDC. (in flow)<\/li>\n<li>2: Two bolt chains RDC of watercourse (below the tree). &#160;To get to these, contour RDC and safety into the cables just as you did previously. &#160;<b>(RECOMMENDED, in flow)<\/b><\/li>\n<li>3: Contouring out RDC even wider, you will find another set of 2 chains with a set of 3-via ferrata sytle rungs, probably used as a staging area for climbing. (Not in the flow)<\/li><\/ul>\n<p>From the 2-chains (anchor 2), it is 150' to the bottom. &#160;There is a small bush\/branches directly below, so just make sure your ropes are set underneath the branches for an easy pull. &#160;Great mild flow, verticality, and NO CROWDS. &#160;A great alternative to battling the masses at Bridal Veil.&#160;:)\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>​Return the way you came.
