  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>If you want to abseil the falls note that some sources on the\ninternet say it is 38m high. This is highly incorrect. From the edge of\nthe falls you want 80m of rope to reach safely the bottom. There are\ngood trees about 6m from the edge.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>Note this trail was recorded from the falls back to the car after\nhelping others abseil.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>After the abseil the walk out the bottom to the road via the creek is\napproximately 2.7km as the crow flys. With high water flow expect it to\ntake a number of hours. There are no additional waterfalls down lower.\nAlso note there is another waterfall off the escarpment only a few\nhundred meters south that on many maps is marked as Teviot falls. Donâ€™t\nknow what it is like to abseil but is does not appear to be a straight\ndrop.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><img src=\"rwl_auto.png\" title=\"rwl_auto.png\" alt=\"rwl_auto.png\" /><a\nhref=\"https://www.wikiloc.com/canyoneering-trails/teviot-falls-abseil-97415882\">Wikiloc.com</a>\n: Teviot Falls Abseil</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n",
