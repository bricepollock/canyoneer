(Note any spectators watching from above).<\/li><\/ul>\n<p>The main section of Deer Creek Falls can produce multiple hazard. The pool at the bottom of the steep falls forms a very turbulent pool in moderate-high flows. It has been rappelled in moderate conditions, however a second major hazard exists just downstream. In the narrows immediately following, the flow is forced under a large log causing a strong strainer to form. Thankfully it's easy to avoid both sections by downclimbing DCR.\n<\/p><p>Continue downstream for a few more obstacles, being weary of pool depth.
