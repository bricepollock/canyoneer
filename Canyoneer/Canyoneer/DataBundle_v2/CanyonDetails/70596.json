  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>This canyon sucks. It’s overrun with weeds, including poison oak, and\nthere is maybe one rappel worth having. Posting here so that future\ngenerations know not to bother checking it out.</p>\n<p>The canyon is clearly shaped by floods, and might actually be pretty\ngreat if the weeds got washed out. If there’s been serious flooding in\nBig Sur recently (but the Big Sur river is still running low enough to\ntraverse) one might consider trying this.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>Park at the Pfeiffer-Big Sur day use area by the baseball diamond.\nHike up Mt. Manuel trail until you cross the drainage. Drop in where the\ndrainage crosses the dry creek.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>There are plentiful obstructions to rig to, though all pulls will be\nobstructed. The final Mt. Manuel falls needs to be broken up into many\nstages simply for pulling. The 0.75 mile creek descent took about 4.5\nhours.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>Creekwalk and boulder-hop out the Big Sur river. When the canyon\nbegins to open up, keep your eye out for a trail down canyon left which\nwill take you through the campground back to the parking lot. Easily the\nbest part of this canyon adventure. You should skip the ditch and go for\na hike up and down the Big Sur river instead.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n"
