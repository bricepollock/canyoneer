A lot of history.\nA ton of bouldering and use of rock climbing moves. If you have to rappel even once,there is not enough time for the full wilderness route.\nSticky shoes and bring your own water essential.\nDont come here in a storm as the visibility could be 25ft.\nBest late October through May.\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Early start.\nDrive or walk to day use parking area @ intersection of Chilao road &amp; Silver Mocassin trail.

The third is a scramble down the watercourse....the others canyon left.\nThe section of the creek between the 4th and 5th obstacle is a slog, but not terrible.\nExit#2(main exit): @ 5th obstacle, a short drop into a pool. Hike up canyon left to peak 4224 ridge and then up and southbound to the southwest\/natural end to the Silver Moccasin trail.\nThirdly, descend Alder Creek to elevation 3700\nFinally, return to Exit#2 since further travel is prohibited and its completely overgrown downstream of Mule Creek\n<\/p><p>Some variations make sense too. Such as an easier route descending East Fork Alder. Or descending Exit#2 to do the end of the route on a separate occasion.\n<\/p><p>Conditioning\/skills:\nThis is not a dare: 'Wilderness', meaning if you treat this route like Runyon or Little Santa Anita, you or your group \nWILL fail to adapt....even with a beacon, it will amount to a difficult rescue based on the large area needed for this beta....so dont come near Exit#1 if something is amiss time-wise, injury-wise or whatever-wise. Consider the terrain after obstacle #5 to be a point of no return with the ability to exit.\n<\/p><p>Weight: Its a question of how much weight you want to carry up and down boulders over and over again. Whereas a heavier backpack for a longer route might be normal in the San Gabriels, in this locale its making the situation worse once you are carrying above a certain weight. For example, doing a full dip strength exercise with 50 lbs around your waist vs 20 lbs.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Silver Moccasin trail.
