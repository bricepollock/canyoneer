The Park contains Cliff Dwellings and other ruins of the Ancestral Puebloans, aka Anasazi, civilization from AD1150-AD1250. \nFor Summer of 2017, there are 3 ranger guided tours offered: Cliff Palace, Long House and Balcony House. Cliff Palace and Long House are not to be missed. Self-guided tours were possible to Step House and Badger House community. The Spruce House is closed indefinitely as the roof of the ramada is cracked and feared to calve off, posing a major challenge to stabilize it. There are many other ruins in the Park to see. Nearby Canyon of the Ancients allows for self-guided visitation to ancient ruins without the crowds. Hovenweep NM is a spectacular collection of about a dozen or more impressive ruins from the Ancestral Puebloan society.\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Red_tape\">Red tape<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Beta_sites\">Beta sites<\/h2><\/div>\n<ul><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http:\/\/www.nps.gov\/meve\/index.htm\">National Park Website<\/a><\/li><\/ul>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Background\">Background<\/h2><\/div>\n\n\n<\/div>","url":"https:\/\/ropewiki.com\/Mesa_Verde_National_Park","waterRating":null,"name":"Mesa Verde National Park","quality":4.4,"rappelLongestMeters":null,"timeRating":null,"latitude":37.336,"version":"b4344ba0205ee94e194c6a8173f192efce6a4c95766eb08487f2cca836380357","vehicle":"Passenger","months":[],"longitude":-108.408,"rappelCountMax":null,"rappelCountMin":null}
