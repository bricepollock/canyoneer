  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>Mesa Verde is the only US National Park that is not about natural\nwonders... it's about archaeology! The Park contains Cliff Dwellings and\nother ruins of the Ancestral Puebloans, aka Anasazi, civilization from\nAD1150-AD1250. For Summer of 2017, there are 3 ranger guided tours\noffered: Cliff Palace, Long House and Balcony House. Cliff Palace and\nLong House are not to be missed. Self-guided tours were possible to Step\nHouse and Badger House community. The Spruce House is closed\nindefinitely as the roof of the ramada is cracked and feared to calve\noff, posing a major challenge to stabilize it. There are many other\nruins in the Park to see. Nearby Canyon of the Ancients allows for\nself-guided visitation to ancient ruins without the crowds. Hovenweep NM\nis a spectacular collection of about a dozen or more impressive ruins\nfrom the Ancestral Puebloan society.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/meve/index.htm\">National Park\nWebsite</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n"
