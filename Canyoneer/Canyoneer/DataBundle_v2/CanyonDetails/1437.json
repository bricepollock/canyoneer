The upper part of the canyon (roughly above Bighorn Mine's elevation) is loose and dangerous, with rocks falling down all year long. The lower section of the canyon provides the goods with smooth chutes, interesting anchors, and slightly less loose rock. One would do well to find a way in from Bighorn Mine, avoiding the upper section.\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Hike to the summit of Baden Powell from the Vincent Gap parking lot.

A helmet is suggested as rocks fall from far above and are obviously funneled down the face into the couloir. Several short rappels off sometimes subpar anchors are in this area.\n<\/p><p>Far down, things clean up and waterflow takes care of some of the quality issues. Interesting rappels off pretty decent anchors bring you down the rest of the way.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Hike to East Fork and take that north to the Vincent Gap Trail.
