  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>Long alpine canyon, it has two sections with nice waterfalls, almost\nat the top, and the very bottom.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>Walk up to Riesflüestäfelo, the path is already not very marked. Then\nit is the best to work with satellite image as you can see a path\nstarting north of the latter, at around 1650m and leading to the start\nof the canyon. In between you'll have to walk through a lot of high\ngrass. Entering the canyon has been done by a 35m abseil from a\ntree.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>It starts with large open 20-30m waterfalls before entering the first\nseries of more vertical and condensed Rappels. Then the middle section\nis a lot of downclimbs, on the way, several smaller rivers join on both\nsides of the slopes. To finish, the last 100m of altitude are again\ninteresting, including a 40m fall.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>The canyon finishes right where the car is parked.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n",
