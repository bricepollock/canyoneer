Gulch","url":"https:\/\/ropewiki.com\/Brown_Gulch","description":"<div class=\"mw-content-ltr mw-parser-output\" lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><p>Brown Gulch is a short canyon located in Silver Plume, a small former silver mining town along Clear Creek in the Front Range of the Rocky Mountains.\n<\/p><p>This canyon runs over dozens of old mining claims which the City of Silver Plume purchased on January 31, 2023 and now owns. At the time of this writing, a commission is being formed to determine the future use of the area, preemptively being called “Silver Plume Mountain Park”. Access to this canyon may change as future land use continues to develop. More information may be available at www.silverplumetown.com\n<\/p><p>The Griffin monument sits atop the large cliff face seen on the approach to the canyon. The monument is the gravesite Clifford Griffin, a heartbroken miner who lost his fiancée to an untimely death, known for playing the violin for the townspeople below from his cabin above.\n<\/p>\n<style data-mw-deduplicate=\"TemplateStyles:r1062633282\">@media all and (max-width:720px){.mw-parser-output .content .thumb>div:not(.thumbinner){display:flex;justify-content:center;flex-wrap:wrap;align-content:flex-start;flex-direction:column}}body.skin-vector .mw-parser-output div.thumb>div:not(.thumbinner){font-size:94%;text-align:center;overflow:hidden;min-width:100px}body.skin-minerva .mw-parser-output div.thumb>div:not(.thumbinner){margin:0 auto;max-width:100%!important}<\/style> \n<div class=\"thumb tright\">\n<div style=\"display:table;\">\n<span class=\"mw-default-size\" typeof=\"mw:Error mw:File\/Frameless\">\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p><b>Driving:<\/b>\nFrom Denver, drive west along I-70.

Park here.\n<\/p><p><br \/>\n<b>Hiking:<\/b>\nOnce parked, follow the old road around the old mine. Take caution and avoid trespassing on the property. A faint mining road appears to the north. Take this road up until it begins to form game trails. Continue working your way up loose scree and mining tailing. Eventually these trails bring you to the large Dunderberg Mine. Avoid the mine as best as possible. Old mining structures and tunnels create a unique hazard. They are unstable, and can give way at any time.\n<\/p>\n<link rel=\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\" href=\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1062633282\"> \n<div class=\"thumb tright\">\n<div style=\"display:table;\">\n<span class=\"mw-default-size\" typeof=\"mw:Error mw:File\/Frameless\">\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>By this point, you can see the whole technical portion of the canyon and assess the flow.
