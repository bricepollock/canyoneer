Watertrap could potentially be useful as well. No anchors were left behind. Be prepared to be creative. Canyon can hold a fair amount of water, but during warmer and\/or drier periods a wetsuit probably isn't needed unless you get cold easily. For the VERY skilled it is possible to stay completely dry (when drier conditins exist and some od the pools are low). Approach is up Death by Chocolate doing at least 2-3 mildly strenuous\/tricky upclimbs. May need a touch more than 160' of rope depending on how you do the entry rap. Camping and 4G in the area.\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Red_tape\">Red tape<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Beta_sites\">Beta sites<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Background\">Background<\/h2><\/div>\n\n\n<\/div>","waterRating":"B","longitude":-110.4558,"geojson":null,"id":82501}
