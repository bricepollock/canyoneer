  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>Canyon was ghosted using sandtrap, natural vegetation, and very\nmarginal rock formations. Watertrap could potentially be useful as well.\nNo anchors were left behind. Be prepared to be creative. Canyon can hold\na fair amount of water, but during warmer and/or drier periods a wetsuit\nprobably isn't needed unless you get cold easily. For the VERY skilled\nit is possible to stay completely dry (when drier conditins exist and\nsome od the pools are low). Approach is up Death by Chocolate doing at\nleast 2-3 mildly strenuous/tricky upclimbs. May need a touch more than\n160' of rope depending on how you do the entry rap. Camping and 4G in\nthe area.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n",
