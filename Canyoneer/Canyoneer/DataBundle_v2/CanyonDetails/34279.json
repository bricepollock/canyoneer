Senator Udall has hopes of passing legislation to turn the 20,000 acre area, north of Salida along the Arkansas River, into a National Monument. There are currently no known technical canyoneering routes but the many streams and creeks may have potential. Middle Cottonwood Creek is one of the larger streams.\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>The canyon is a very popular whitewater kayaking destination, as well as a possible canyoneering destination. And descending down through the Arkansas River in a kayak or raft is a very worthy river trip to go for while there. As to the additional activity to potential canyoneering opportunities, unknown at this time, the future will tell. But just as a Point-of-Interest (POI) classification, it is a place to be noted, and rated here.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Red_tape\">Red tape<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Beta_sites\">Beta sites<\/h2><\/div>\n<ul><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http:\/\/summitpost.org\/browns-canyon\/894083\">SummitPost.org<\/a> &#160;: Browns Canyon<\/li><\/ul>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Background\">Background<\/h2><\/div>\n\n\n<\/div>","waterRating":null,"url":"https:\/\/ropewiki.com\/Browns_Canyon","version":"1a5819c2aa4ea2246b86d4bc40f9a23ef9eed963636e1442a4196d6bf839b716","timeRating":null,"permit":"No"}
