  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>Brown's Canyon of the Arkansas River is a popular whitewater rafting\ndestination. Senator Udall has hopes of passing legislation to turn the\n20,000 acre area, north of Salida along the Arkansas River, into a\nNational Monument. There are currently no known technical canyoneering\nroutes but the many streams and creeks may have potential. Middle\nCottonwood Creek is one of the larger streams.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>The canyon is a very popular whitewater kayaking destination, as well\nas a possible canyoneering destination. And descending down through the\nArkansas River in a kayak or raft is a very worthy river trip to go for\nwhile there. As to the additional activity to potential canyoneering\nopportunities, unknown at this time, the future will tell. But just as a\nPoint-of-Interest (POI) classification, it is a place to be noted, and\nrated here.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><img src=\"rwl_en.png\" title=\"rwl_en.png\" alt=\"rwl_en.png\" /><a\nhref=\"http://summitpost.org/browns-canyon/894083\">SummitPost.org</a> :\nBrowns Canyon</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n",
