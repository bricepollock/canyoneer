  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>A pretty canyon, just half-day loop from Cathedral Reserve\ncampground. The canyon was once popular, with seemingly Victorian era\nsteps cut into the rock to avoid one of the pools. Always difficult to\nknow how often a canyon is visited, you'd think this would be\ninfrequent, but 3 separate groups were in the canyon on Sat 3 Feb\n2024.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>From Cathedral Reserve campground, walk up to Beowang Rd and follow\nit to the end, then skirt the final property on the left outside of the\nprivate property boundary.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>There are swimming pools, but you can keep to waist deep if you're\ncareful and select the best side of each drop to descend.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>Up steep dirt slopes to the Mt Irvine Road.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n",
