  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>\"There are via ferratas and there are via ferratas. The Via Ferrata\nCagate Lorito is in the latter of these categories.\"</p>\n<p>\"It is one of a handful of K6 ferratas in Spain. It's relatively\nnewly installed (2012) and packs a punch from the start to the end\nwithout many places for resting. The truth is that it's an absolute\nbeauty! Definitely not a ferrata for the faint of heart but if you enjoy\nsome slightly upside down climbing, don't miss this one! It is difficult\nbut it's also very well equipped, lots of rungs, plenty of nice thick\ncable to clip in to, and you never feel unsafe, even when you have to\ncross the 3m overhanging roof to gain access to the hanging ladder.</p>\n<p>Amazing exposure throughout but even more so as you gain height\nbecause just about all of it is slightly overhanging. Add on a couple of\nbig roofs and you've gained quite a bit of outward distance since the\nstart. At the top you get to cross a fun 10m long cable bridge from one\noutcrop to another. From there it's not over yet, as you have to descend\nabout 3m and then the cable ends!\"</p>\n<p><a\nhref=\"http://bigtimeaventura.com/via-ferrata-cagate-lorito/\">http://bigtimeaventura.com/via-ferrata-cagate-lorito/</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><img src=\"rwl_en.png\" title=\"rwl_en.png\" alt=\"rwl_en.png\" /><a\nhref=\"https://www.ukclimbing.com/logbook/c.php?i=483224\">UK Climbing</a>\n: Via Ferrata Cágate Lorito</li>\n<li><img src=\"rwl_fr.png\" title=\"rwl_fr.png\" alt=\"rwl_fr.png\" /><a\nhref=\"http://climbing7.wordpress.com/2016/08/04/cagate-lorito\">Climbing7</a>\n: Via Ferrata Cágate Lorito</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n"
