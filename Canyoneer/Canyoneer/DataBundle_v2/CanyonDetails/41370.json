The Via Ferrata Cagate Lorito is in the latter of these categories.\"\n<\/p><p>\"It is one of a handful of K6 ferratas in Spain. It's relatively newly installed (2012) and packs a punch from the start to the end without many places for resting. The truth is that it's an absolute beauty! Definitely not a ferrata for the faint of heart but if you enjoy some slightly upside down climbing, don't miss this one! It is difficult but it's also very well equipped, lots of rungs, plenty of nice thick cable to clip in to, and you never feel unsafe, even when you have to cross the 3m overhanging roof to gain access to the hanging ladder.\n<\/p><p>Amazing exposure throughout but even more so as you gain height because just about all of it is slightly overhanging. Add on a couple of big roofs and you've gained quite a bit of outward distance since the start. At the top you get to cross a fun 10m long cable bridge from one outcrop to another. From there it's not over yet, as you have to descend about 3m and then the cable ends!\"\n<\/p><p><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external free\" href=\"http:\/\/bigtimeaventura.com\/via-ferrata-cagate-lorito\/\">http:\/\/bigtimeaventura.com\/via-ferrata-cagate-lorito\/<\/a>\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Red_tape\">Red tape<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Beta_sites\">Beta sites<\/h2><\/div>\n<ul><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https:\/\/www.ukclimbing.com\/logbook\/c.php?i=483224\">UK Climbing<\/a>&#160;: Via Ferrata Cágate Lorito<\/li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http:\/\/climbing7.wordpress.com\/2016\/08\/04\/cagate-lorito\">Climbing7<\/a> &#160;: Via Ferrata Cágate Lorito<\/li><\/ul>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Background\">Background<\/h2><\/div>\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nParsed by mw‐api‐ext.codfw.main‐6779cc57fc‐zd82l\nCached time: 20240914191839\nCache expiry: 2592000\nReduced expiry: false\nComplications: [show‐toc]\nCPU time usage: 0.005 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.007 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 21\/1000000\nPost‐expand include size: 0\/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 0\/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 2\/100\nExpensive parser function count: 0\/500\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0\/20\nUnstrip post‐expand size: 0\/5000000 bytes\nNumber of Wikibase entities loaded: 0\/400\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%    0.000      1 -total\n-->\n<\/div>","waterRating":null,"geojson":null,"riskRating":null,"rappelCountMin":null,"longitude":0.8411,"rappelLongestMeters":null}
