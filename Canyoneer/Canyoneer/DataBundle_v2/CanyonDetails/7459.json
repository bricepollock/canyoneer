Especially nice in Spring when water flows through the canyon, this descent should not be attempted in summer when the desert is scorching hot.\n<\/p><p>The canyon has several potholes that usually will require wading through waist deep pools. The last pothole is a swimmer, but can be avoided climbing carefully out on canyon left. The canyon is so short that no wetsuits should be required.  \n<\/p><p>Indian Cave: There is also a small cave nearby called Indian Cave (see map). This cave is a Talus cave (formed by water flowing through boulders) and has no formations but still makes for a fun through trip. There are couple of tight belly crawls on sand that can be bypassed by climbing over the boulders. The exit is right after a big underground waterfall, climbing around and back over the falls and then up through intricate passage till you surface next to a undercut rock. Once out, you can keep exploring upstream (the cave somehow continues here and there) or you can return boulder hopping on the surface to where you started.\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>From the parking lot follow the wash to the base of the canyon and then scramble up the rocks on canyon left.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>All the anchors are usually \"nuts\" left by rock climbers, not likely to be there after a flood.
