  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>Canyon was explored but not fully descended. Top narrows are choked\nwith brush leading to a short series of drops with potholes. These were\ndeep, extremely stagnant, covered with a layer of thick green algae, and\ncontained rotting animals. This canyon will be worthwhile in early\nspring with fresh water.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>From the road walk either drainage to their confluence and the start\nof the route.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>R1: ~80 feet off small tree DCL into deep murky pothole</p>\n<p>This is the only rappel descended.</p>\n<p>From here, expect 2 to 4 more drops depending on whether stages are\ncombined.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>There is a break in the cliff walls where you can scramble up to the\nrim at approximately 35.14663, -111.57436. This is a rough estimate\nmeant to approximate the section. From here look for a game trail that\nzig zags up to the rim.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n<p>Initial Exploration by Cooper Smith and Eric Moorcroft on 8-7-23.</p>\n",
