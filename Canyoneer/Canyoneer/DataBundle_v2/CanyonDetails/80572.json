Top narrows are choked with brush leading to a short series of drops with potholes. These were deep, extremely stagnant, covered with a layer of thick green algae, and contained rotting animals. This canyon will be worthwhile in early spring with fresh water.\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>From the road walk either drainage to their confluence and the start of the route.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>R1: ~80 feet off small tree DCL into deep murky pothole\n<\/p><p>This is the only rappel descended. \n<\/p><p>From here, expect 2 to 4 more drops depending on whether stages are combined.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>There is a break in the cliff walls where you can scramble up to the rim at approximately 35.14663, -111.57436.
