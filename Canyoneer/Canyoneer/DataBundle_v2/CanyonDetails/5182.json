The kml track reduces this exposure by going lower, but still requires a few quick moves across a sandstone slope with a 30' consequence. As you progress uphill, you'll see many trails cutting right into the canyon too early. The 2nd or 3rd is the right one. The first leads to a tree with an anchor that drops you in above R2 but is totally unnecessary. Just backtrack, go further uphill, and catch the trail that leads all the way into the canyon. The slab traverses are 4th class, so if you're doing some sketchy friction slab climbing with tons of exposure, you may be in the wrong place.\n<\/p><p><b>Upper R1-R5: (50min)<\/b> <font color=\"red\">Most people will likely want to skip R1.<\/font> It's a lot more work for just one rappel and requires more unremarkable stream walking to get back to R2. Game trails lead to the upper falls along the south side of the canyon doubling the approach time. Referencing the kml track and waypoints may be helpful, but generally tracking uphill through the forest will eventually lead to views of the upper waterfall from the parking location.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p><b>Upper R1-R5 = 1h15min<br \/><\/b>\n<b>Lower R2-R5 = 30-45min<br \/><\/b>\n<br \/>\n<b>R1:<\/b> 75' off tree Canyon Left.
