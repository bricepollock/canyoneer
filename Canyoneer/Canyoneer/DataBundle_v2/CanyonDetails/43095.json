This creek was\noverrun by the Beachie/Santiam Fire in Sept 2020 and has been closed.\nPlease check on local closures before planning a trip to this area. When\nthe area eventually reopens, use extreme caution when descending the\ncreek. Between landslides, fallen trees, and loose rocks, this area may\nbe unstable and dangerous for years to come. The canyon may have changed\ndramatically. Do not rely on the beta below being\naccurate.</font></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Update 2023: Estimated to open in late summer/fall 2023. (Opening\nbeing managed by Marion County Public Works.) <a\nhref=\"https://www.oregon.gov/odf/recreation/pages/santiam-state-forest.aspx\">Closure\nInfo.</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Evans Creek is a major tributary of the Little North Santiam River,\nnorth of the small community of Elkhorn Valley. It's a close cousin of\nHenline next door, but the rappels are spaced further apart. Best done\nwith a shuttle. Map and GPS are handy as the exit route is not entirely\nobvious. Evans has three main waterfalls spaced out over 1.25 miles.\nThere's also a small, cave-like, boulder drop between the upper and\nmiddle drop that has some neat geology.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>Enter Evans Creek via a side drainage that drops in just before the\nupper falls. This will add 3-5 rappels. There is also a decent ridge\nthat can be walked that avoids the rappels</p>\n<p>For extra bonus points, there's another waterfall immediately\nupstream of the road. Thrash up the climber's right side of the drainage\nand drop back in above it. The falls is about 30ft high but may require\nmore rope to get down. It is possible to pass through the culvert\nunderneath the road, but be aware: the stream drops about 12ft on the\nfar side requiring tunnel-crawlers to undertake an awkward downclimb out\none side or the other and down a dirty embankment.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>R1: 25ft, tree on right.</li>\n<li>R2: 35ft, tree set back about 15ft. A doubled 100ft rope is about\n10ft short, but one can downclimb the rest.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Below, pass through an interesting bedrock area with several\ndownclimbs and slides. There's a 10ft slide into a pool, followed by a\nsecond drop which can be downclimbed.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>R3: 20ft, tree on the left. Walk another minute downstream to the\nconfluence. The water will, effectively, triple at this point.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>R4: <em>Upper Evans Falls</em> ~175ft. Anchor is on a tree DCR. This\nwaterfall is two-tiered with a nice hanging pool between the tiers. In\nsummer, with low flow, it's possible to rappel the entire falls from\nthis anchor. In high flow, use a bolt station DCR above the second tier\nand rappel along the side of the falls. Very photogenic.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Downstream, the creek passes through a nice narrows with some areas\nof bedrock. It's about 0.3mi to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>R5: 25ft. The creek turns a corner here and funnels through a narrow\nslot into a cave-like space under a giant boulder. Beware unseen pothole\nnear the top of the falls that can be tricky to get out of in high flow.\nIf you choose to run the drop, it will be pushy even in summer. Drop can\nbe bypassed easily DCR.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Continue downstream another 0.3mi through more bedrock areas to the\nmiddle falls. Along the way:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Reach a 35ft drop between some giant boulders. Gap was clogged with\nold growth logs. Rappel or downclimb DCL.</li>\n<li>Reach 15ft drop and carved out channel/slide on the creek. Rappel or\ndownclimb DCR.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>R6: <em>Middle Evans Falls</em> 120ft from tree DCL. Walk 150yrds to\nthe lower falls.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>R7: <em>Lower Evans Falls</em> 50ft. Tree DCR.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>About 100ft downstream is the final drop on Evans. It's about 10ft\nhigh. Rappel, slide, or downclimb DCR. Below is a deep channel to swim\nout. You can bypass this area in high flow by scrambling up a narrow\nchute to the ridge DCL.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>Exit the creek immediately below the last drop up an old logging\ngrade / game trail. Follow this east/southeast through some brush to\neventually encounter an old logging track. Folow this back out to Evans\nMountain Road. A map &amp; GPS are handy to keep you on track here. The\nexit takes 15-20min. (Do not keep going down the creek or you will enter\nprivate property.)</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<p>Saw a bunch more trash and shooting along the road. Be mindful that\nlocals will shoot directly in the road and you may hear it while running\nthe canyon.</p>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><img src=\"rwl_en.png\" title=\"rwl_en.png\" alt=\"rwl_en.png\" /><a\nhref=\"http://karl-helser.com/evans-creek-canyoneer-7-23-16\">Karl\nHelser's NW Adventures</a> : Evans Creek Canyoneer 7-23-16</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n",
