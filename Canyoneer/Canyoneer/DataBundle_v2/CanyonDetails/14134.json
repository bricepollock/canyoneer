Bel Oublié is a pretty gully that turns into its half into a magnificent canyon, which includes a sequence of 26 waterfalls without heavy dead time. The last hour and a half is a festival of large cascades (20 \/ 30m) chained, with tributaries cascading in a concealed environment and covered with vegetation. The arrival in the Valençant arm is done in RG at the foot of the C45. One quickly enters the heart of the subject of the Valenrant Arm. The first 2 hours are quite continuous in an aquatic atmosphere and concealed (many jumps, and waterfalls more or less watered). As soon as you pass the confluence with the Tanguy arm, there are 2 good hours including beautiful passages but much more discontinuous. The last hour in Valençant is downright tedious. As soon as you arrive in the Grande Rivière, all you have to do is go down along the water for a little less than 2 hours. The descent is long and tedious because it's been more than 10 hours we left, but the course remains easy (no blocks or trunks too galley) and the swimming is short and rare.\"\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Red_tape\">Red tape<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Beta_sites\">Beta sites<\/h2><\/div>\n<ul><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http:\/\/descente-canyon.com\/canyoning\/canyon-description\/23152?kmlidxna\">Descente-Canyon.com<\/a> &#160;: Bel Oublié<\/li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http:\/\/icopro.org\/canyon\/view\/id\/106\">Icopro.org<\/a> &#160;: Bel Oublié<\/li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http:\/\/ankanionla-madinina.com\/Martinique\/Pelee\/Le%20bel%20oublie%20Grand%20Riviere.htm?kmlidxna\">An Kanion La-madinina<\/a> &#160;: Le bel Oublié Grand Rivière<\/li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http:\/\/ankanionla-madinina.com\/Files\/Other\/Divers\/Liste%20rivieres%20et%20ravines.pdf?id=MP-59&amp;kmlidx=14.8205:-61.1728:14.8668:-61.1755\">An Kanion La-madinina<\/a> &#160;: Le Bel Oublié [MP-59]<\/li><\/ul>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Background\">Background<\/h2><\/div>\n\n\n<\/div>","longitude":-61.1728}
