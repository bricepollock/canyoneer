  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>Candy Canyon is a sandstone slot canyon on the Navajo Indian\nReservation. This canyon was first descended on Halloween 2020 by Suhei\nand Lukas Eddy. It is part of the Potato Canyon complex. This complex\ndoes not have any known exits, and all canyoneering routes require\nfixing ropes and ascending back up to exit.</p>\n<p>Bring at least three 100-foot ropes, and several lengths of webbing\nof 30+ feet.</p>\n<p>All Kaibeto-area canyons are closed to visitation of any kind by\nnon-Navajo persons. These closures are documented in Michael Kelsey's\nbook Technical Slot Canyon Guide to the Colorado Plateau and on the\nNavajo Parks and Recreation Department website here: <a\nhref=\"https://navajonationparks.org/rules-regulations/\">1</a>.\nVisitation to all Kaibeto area canyons is considered trespassing and is\nillegal.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>Follow the map above to reach the parking area. From the parking\narea, use your GPS to navigate 15 minutes or so to the start of the\nslot. Go down the small hill towards the northwest, and follow the main\nwash. You'll pass through a brief section of slot with a downclimb,\nwhich will then open up before becoming the main slot.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>Downclimb into the slot. There are several tricky downclimbs in the\nbeginning. This slot has only a midway exit, so you'll need to return\nback up the slot. Anything you descend, you must be able to ascend. If\nin doubt at any downclimb, fix a rope or handline.</p>\n<p>As such, you must not pull your ropes, and you need complete\nascending gear to ascend all rappels. All rappels are to be left fixed\nin place.</p>\n<p>The slot will deepen and tighten quickly. There is one brief dark\narea that involves crawling under large boulders.</p>\n<p>Then comes rappel 1, 60+ feet. The anchor is a chockstone back 20\nfeet from the lip.</p>\n<p>After rappel 1, you'll quickly reach rappel 2. Rappel 2 is maybe 40\nfeet, but the anchor, a semi-buried boulder, is far up canyon, and\nyou'll need at least 100 feet of rope. A rope protector is a good idea,\nto protect both your rope and the fragile sandstone.</p>\n<p>The slot after R2 is gorgeous, especially in the right lighting.</p>\n<p>The slot opens for several minutes of walking. Here, you'll find a\nClass II escape route on canyon right, should you need it.</p>\n<p>Continuing, you are faced with a 20 foot slab which would be\nimpossible to decend or ascend without a handline. You can fix a\nhandline or an etrier off a boulder.</p>\n<p>Next, the canyon has a downclimb into what may be a deep pool, or a\ndry mud pit. From here, it's a 30-foot rappel off a natural anchor\nfarther upcanyon.</p>\n<p>Below this rappel, the canyon is easy walking and arrives at an\nintersection. Turn around when comfortable, and ascend back\nupcanyon.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>Return the way you came, ascending all downclimbs and rappels.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<p>Entry to this area is restricted for all non-Navajo persons. If you\nare not Navajo, and are in this canyon, is it considered illegal. Please\nrespect local rules and regulations when planning your canyoneering\ntrip.</p>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<p>First descended on 10/31/2020. No bolts were placed. All natural\nanchors were used.</p>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n<p>This canyon, while easily accessible, was first descended on\nHalloween 2020. Though other canyons in Kaibeto were first descended in\nthe 1980s and 1990s, this one may have been skipped over due to its\nsmall size.</p>\n",
