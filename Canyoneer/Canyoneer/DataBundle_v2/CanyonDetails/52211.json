Be\nprepared for Pit of Despair and the Wart.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<p>4/13/2019: 5 people, 12 hours camp to camp. Use Poe approach to 4700\nfoot level, then instead of turning south to go to Poe, continue\nstraight up another 400 foot gain. Drop in is at 5,000 feet, making it\nslightly longer than Poe. Upper section is a romp and well worth the\nextra effort. Middle section begins at 4620 feet and runs to the\nconfluence with Poe. From confluence to Pit of Despair is about 1 hour.\nWe were 4 for 9 with pot shot throws. 4 were in the crevice. Water level\nin the Wart pothole was about 8 feet below the lip. Poison Ivy at the\nexit was still babies but will be thick soon.

To make the potshots of value they have to be thrown about 45 feet over the pit and beyond the patio. Mother nature bumps the level of difficulty up by giving you no good place to stand when tossing the potshots. You will need to stem up in a V slot about 6 feet to get a good throwing angle making for a very awkward stance. Mother nature bumps up the difficulty level once again by giving you a very narrow window to aim at by placing the canyons walls in the way. This is a difficult toss and worth preparing for with lots of practice! This toss is as difficult as stories make it sound. (Data by bluugnome.com)",

You have to climb up to The Wart which is an easy climb / scramble but it is exposed and a little scary. Rap 15 is just after The Wart and anchored from a single bolted anchor RDC and drops about 30 feet.
