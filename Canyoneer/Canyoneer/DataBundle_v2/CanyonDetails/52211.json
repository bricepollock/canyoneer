Use Poe approach to 4700 foot level, then instead of turning south to go to Poe, continue straight up another 400 foot gain. Drop in is at 5,000 feet, making it slightly longer than Poe. Upper section is a romp and well worth the extra effort. Middle section begins at 4620 feet and runs to the confluence with Poe. From confluence to Pit of Despair is about 1 hour. We were 4 for 9 with pot shot throws. 4 were in the crevice. Water level in the Wart pothole was about 8 feet below the lip. Poison Ivy at the exit was still babies but will be thick soon.
