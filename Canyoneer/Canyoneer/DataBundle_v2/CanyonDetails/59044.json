While short, this is probably the only slot canyon in the Eastern Sierra. The canyon was formed in the Bishop Tuff Ash \/ Conglomerate rock from an underwater eruption when Mono Lake was much bigger than it is today.\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>From the Black Rock BLM trailhead (38.027176, -119.084617) walk ~one mile mostly west along unofficial use-trails until you reach one of the two starting points. Either start at the mid-point (38.027261,-119.099739) which focuses on the slottiest parts or try for the whole thing. Starting where the rupture was wider (38.028289,-119.100053).\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>For either starting point, head down the canyon. There might be some scrambling and some shimmying but no rope is required and no drops are required. Just after the midpoint entrance (38.027261,-119.099739) there is a collapsed blocked section that requires shuffling through a slot about hip-width and ending with a hip-rotation out. Its not too tight as these are my descriptions from a 6'6\" 210lbs man. After walking through a deep slot canyon 15-22ft high you'll eventually be spit out into a beautiful view of mono lake (38.026342,-119.100539).\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Pick any trail, trying to avoid crushing the brush and leave no trace for one mile back to the car.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Red_tape\">Red tape<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Beta_sites\">Beta sites<\/h2><\/div>\n<ul><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https:\/\/www.americansouthwest.net\/california\/mono_lake\/black-point-fissures.html\">American Southwest Summary<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https:\/\/www.alltrails.com\/trail\/us\/california\/black-point-fissures-trail\">All Trails Approach<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https:\/\/www.theoutbound.com\/yosemite\/hiking\/explore-the-black-point-fissures\">The Outbound Collective<\/a><\/li><\/ul>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Background\">Background<\/h2><\/div>\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nParsed by mw‐api‐ext.codfw.main‐6779cc57fc‐zgpcs\nCached time: 20240914191825\nCache expiry: 2592000\nReduced expiry: false\nComplications: [show‐toc]\nCPU time usage: 0.005 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.007 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 21\/1000000\nPost‐expand include size: 0\/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 0\/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 2\/100\nExpensive parser function count: 0\/500\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0\/20\nUnstrip post‐expand size: 0\/5000000 bytes\nNumber of Wikibase entities loaded: 0\/400\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%    0.000      1 -total\n-->\n<\/div>","rappelCountMax":0,"geojson":null,"timeRating":"I","shuttleSeconds":null,"version":"a00b4041d9fe1f023615b1e8b280741efcca60a4bccefcdac8d68b7d6131e530","url":"https:\/\/ropewiki.com\/Black_Point_Fissures","quality":4,"id":59044,"permit":"No","months":["Apr","May","Jun","Jul","Aug","Sep","Oct","Nov"],"rappelLongestMeters":null}
