  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>The Black Point Fissures are an obscure break in the ground forming a\n10-22 ft deep slot canyon experience. While short, this is probably the\nonly slot canyon in the Eastern Sierra. The canyon was formed in the\nBishop Tuff Ash / Conglomerate rock from an underwater eruption when\nMono Lake was much bigger than it is today.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>From the Black Rock BLM trailhead (38.027176, -119.084617) walk ~one\nmile mostly west along unofficial use-trails until you reach one of the\ntwo starting points. Either start at the mid-point\n(38.027261,-119.099739) which focuses on the slottiest parts or try for\nthe whole thing. Starting where the rupture was wider\n(38.028289,-119.100053).</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>For either starting point, head down the canyon. There might be some\nscrambling and some shimmying but no rope is required and no drops are\nrequired. Just after the midpoint entrance (38.027261,-119.099739) there\nis a collapsed blocked section that requires shuffling through a slot\nabout hip-width and ending with a hip-rotation out. Its not too tight as\nthese are my descriptions from a 6'6\" 210lbs man. After walking through\na deep slot canyon 15-22ft high you'll eventually be spit out into a\nbeautiful view of mono lake (38.026342,-119.100539).</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>Pick any trail, trying to avoid crushing the brush and leave no trace\nfor one mile back to the car.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a\nhref=\"https://www.americansouthwest.net/california/mono_lake/black-point-fissures.html\">American\nSouthwest Summary</a></li>\n<li><a\nhref=\"https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/california/black-point-fissures-trail\">All\nTrails Approach</a></li>\n<li><a\nhref=\"https://www.theoutbound.com/yosemite/hiking/explore-the-black-point-fissures\">The\nOutbound Collective</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n"
