{"technicalRating":3,"rappelLongestMeters":32,"shuttleSeconds":null,"description":"<div class=\"mw-content-ltr mw-parser-output\" lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><p>Beautiful slot with curved limestone walls. According to Rick Ianiello (author of Las Vegas Slots) this is one of the best canyons in the Las Vegas area.\n<\/p><p>Cherry has been descended for more than a decade, by hundreds of people, using only natural anchors (such as those described in the beta below). Please, if you are planning on making a descent, know how to evaluate, construct, and manage natural anchors within a technical canyon. Cherry is not \"throw and go\" where every anchor is always simple. Every potential descent needs to be prepared with the knowledge and equipment to evaluate and construct these natural anchors. If you do not have these skills, please learn them in a controlled-safe environment hopefully from an experienced source, BEFORE going in Cherry canyon. With the proper understanding the anchors in Cherry are not sketchy nor dangerous, and risks of using natural anchors can be can be effectively and safely managed. \n<\/p><p>This is not the place to pull out the drill and install bolts or other fixed anchors. They are absolutely not needed outside of a Land Manager sponsored SAR operation. If you cannot, or don't feel comfortable, descending Cherry without the use or installation of bolts, don't do it, and don't install them. Fixed anchors have been removed from Cherry TWICE before. Learn the skills to do so without, and come back later.\n<\/p><p><b>Cherry Canyon is within the the federally designated Paiute Wilderness Area.<\/b> Please abide by the laws of Wilderness Areas. That means it is illegal use motorized equipment (I'm looking at you power drill).  However, to be precise it is legal to hand drill anything in a willderness area.  So if your up to the task you can place a bolt.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Parking for this canyon is only accessible going northbound on I-15. If coming from Utah you must travel pass the parking site and turnaround at the next exit.  The current GPS coordinates for parking are correct\/confirmed.  There is a sizable gravel parking area off the Interstate that will allow for several cars.  This parking is not an on\/off ramp so be careful merging with high speed traffic on I15.\n<\/p><p>After parking, scrambled down the trail to the Virgin River.  You must cross the river which has variable flows. \nCheck here: <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external free\" href=\"https:\/\/waterdata.usgs.gov\/monitoring-location\/09413700\/#parameterCode=00060&amp;period=P7D\">https:\/\/waterdata.usgs.gov\/monitoring-location\/09413700\/#parameterCode=00060&amp;period=P7D<\/a>\nAt approx 110 CFS the water level is about knee deep.  Since this is a dry canyon, most groups take an extra pair of wet shoes for the crossing and stash them for the return trip. \n<\/p><p>During spring runoff or recent storm the Virgin River will NOT be wade-able. Water levels can be checked here <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https:\/\/waterdata.usgs.gov\/usa\/nwis\/uv?site_no=09413500\">USGS Water Flow<\/a>\n<\/p><p>Download GPS coordinates included on this map page are confirmed.  \n<\/p><p>Follow the obvious wash to the left.  Eventually the trail leaves the gravel semi-flat wash after about 15 mins and a strenuous scramble up begins to the left.  The scramble is non-technical and not exposed but very strenuous.  Plan on 60-90 mins of continuous strenuous scramble.  If doing this scramble during warmer months an early start will be in the shade.  There is no defined trail but the route (go up) is obvious and the ridge point on the GPS coordinates is accurate\/confirmed.  Once on top of the ridge look straight down at the obvious wash which leads directly into Cherry Canyon. Pick your way down to the wash by any numerous game trails, turn right, traveling down wash which will lead to the first rappel.  This start of this canyon is easy to find without any confusion.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>There are only natural anchors in this canyon.  There are no bolted raps.  Anchors include trees, rock arches, rock pinches, and cairns.  Groups need to be familiar with evaluating and constructing natural anchors.  Webbing may need to be replaced on occasion.  100 feet of webbing would be advised if numerous anchors need to be replaced.\n<\/p><p>Max rap is about 105-110 feet.  A 65 meter (213 ft) rope will cover all raps but this could change depending on how far the anchors are set back.  A 200 foot rope will be slightly short but could be extended with webbing etc...\n<\/p><p>Several raps are multi-pitch which does not allow the group to see the bottom of the rap from the start point. \n<\/p><p>Numerous anchors are set back from the rappel that can catch the rope on the pull.  Most raps will require a test pull to ensure rope retrieval. \n<\/p><p>Most rappel starts are friendly, sloping starts that are suitable for novices with a skilled leader.\n<\/p><p><b>R1<\/b> boulder 40-45'<br \/>\n<b>R2<\/b> cairn 15'<br \/>\n<b>R3<\/b> cairn three-stage 100'<br \/>\n<b>R4<\/b> small tree 85'<br \/>\nSmall natural slide *whee*<br \/>\n<b>R5<\/b> small arch LDC wall about 5' off the ground or tree 35'<br \/>\n<b>R6<\/b> cairn 30'<br \/>\n<b>R7<\/b> tree 25-30'<br \/>\n<b>R8<\/b> tree LDC 25-30'<br \/>\n<b>R9<\/b> cairn 80'<br \/>\n<b>R10<\/b> cairn 30'<br \/>\n<b>R11<\/b> cairn 40' (Strongly recommend test pull here - Pinch point LDC)<br \/>\nCanyon opens up.
