{"description":"<div class=\"mw-content-ltr mw-parser-output\" lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><p>A canyon that exits to the Arroyo. Currently in dry overgrown conditions, the canyon has a lot of potential for fun if water was flowing.\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Cross the road and drop in the south ridge on the canyon. Once at the bottom you should see a large drainage culvert that went under the road. Continue down the canyon until you come to the 8 ft down climb.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>The 8 ft down climb can be climbed down either left, right or center.\n<\/p><p>Rappel 1: 80 ft, anchored from a tree DCL.\n<\/p><p>Rappel 2: 40 ft, anchored from a low tree DCL. This rappel is immediately after R1\n<\/p><p>Rappel 3: 50 ft, anchored from a bush DCR.\n<\/p><p>Rappel 4: 15 ft, anchored from a tree DCL.\n<\/p><p>There is a long stretch of canyon with not much action in between rappels 4 and 5.\n<\/p><p>There is a down climb that could be a nice slide with water flowing. Carefully climb down the chute and climb across the roots on the right side.\n<\/p><p>Rappel 5: 12 ft, anchored from a small tree DCR. It may be possible to down climb this rappel.\n<\/p><p>Rappel 6: 20 ft, anchored from a bush DCL.\n<\/p><p>Rappel 7: 20 ft, anchored from a cairn anchor in the center of the canyon.\n<\/p><p>Rappel 8: 20 ft, rope thrown around a dead log hanging across the center of the canyon. Can be down climbed carefully.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Continue through the canyon to the Arroyo. Walk along the bed of the Arroyo, there are no real remnants of the old trail shown on the topo map. \n<\/p><p>Once you are at the confluence with Dark Canyon, you should see large electrical towers on a ridge to the west. Continue up the wash towards dark canyon approximately 100 yards from the Arroyo. Turn to your left (southwest) and approach the flat ridge near the waypoint for the start of the Twin Canyon trail. \n<\/p><p>Continue up the faint use trail until you reach the bottom of the large electrical towers. After the towers continue up to the center of the ridge. Follow the trail to the shuttle location.\n<\/p><p>There is another option for getting back to the road: continue west along Dark Canyon which has a well-defined trail marked with orange flags. This trail switches to the east and then back to the west as it ascends. This way is more mileage than Twin Canyon but may be easier going.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Red_tape\">Red tape<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2
