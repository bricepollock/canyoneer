The cave is 1300 meters long, with formations and blind fish, and leads to the bottom of the sotano, which is 240 meters deep and located at about the halfway point (see cave map). It is a fantastic system, located in awesome remote jungle with parrots, monkeys, etc.\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>To get to the cave (either upper or lower entrance), it is necessary first to get to Raudales de Malpaso. From Raudules you can take a water taxi the rest of the way (1h), and they will drop you off at the town of Agua Blanca, which is on the shore. You will need to hire a guide to take you to the cave. From Agua Blanca a trail takes to the lower entrance of the cave (resurgence), and a completely different one to the pit. If you want to drop the pit make sure to ask the guide to take you to \"el sotano\".\n<\/p><p>If you don't find any competent guide in Agua Blanca you will have to hike to the town of La Lucha (2 hour hike from Agua Blanca) and look for a guide there.\n<\/p><p>The hike to the cave is very wild and long, you will have to overnight out there in the jungle. Camping in the cave is not recommended as it has been known to flood from time to time even in the absence of rain.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Return boats leave daily from Agua Blanca.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Red_tape\">Red tape<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Beta_sites\">Beta sites<\/h2><\/div>\n<ul><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http:\/\/www.amcs-pubs.org\/maps\/3124.pdf\">Cave Map<\/a><\/li><\/ul>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Background\">Background<\/h2><\/div>\n\n\n<\/div>","months":[],"permit":"No","name":"Sistema de La Lucha","url":"https:\/\/ropewiki.com\/Sistema_de_La_Lucha","rappelLongestMeters":240,"rappelCountMax":null}
