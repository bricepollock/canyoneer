{"rappelCountMin":5,"technicalRating":3,"shuttleSeconds":null,"description":"<div class=\"mw-content-ltr mw-parser-output\" lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><p>This is one of the most beautiful canyons in the area. The bolted rappels down the watercourse allow you to enjoy the rappels into hanging granite bowls with extensive views of the surrounding mountains and the drainage of the Middle Fork of Lytle Creek.\nIt is possible to do this canyon mostly dry (see <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http:\/\/www.brennen.caltech.edu\/advents\/midlyt.htm\">Chris Brennen's Hike J1<\/a>) but I will describe the more recently bolted version which raps down the watercourse.\nThe approach hike is heavily used, and there are campsites in multiple places along the creek side below the approach path.\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>From Los Angeles take the I-210 east or the I-10 or I-60 east to the I-15 north, then drive north on the I-15 to Sierra Avenue. Turn north onto Lytle Creek Road and follow signs for the Lytle Creek Recreation area. You will pass the Ranger Station on the right, and the South Fork Road to Bonita Ranch on your left. Just as you enter the village of Scotland, at 34.242335N, 117.497921W, turn left onto Middle Fork Road. It is easy to miss, so keep a sharp lookout. Drive along this road for a short while and it turns to a dirt road. Follow it to its end at the trailhead. This road can get washed out and accessible only to 4 wheel drive vehicles in the winter, but it is generally fine for regular cars as long as you drive it very carefully.\nThe trailhead starts at 34.253698N, 117.540169W. There are a few branches to the left which take you to the creek bed, but stick right on the main trail. The trail is heavily used and easy to follow up until it crosses the main drainage of the Middle Fork. About 2.2 miles up the trail you finally cross the main drainage to the south side. The trail is a little harder to follow here. Up on the south bank between the stream and the hill there are camp sites. Cross through the camping area headed toward the hillside and you will find a faint trail headed west (right) and up along the base of the hill. Follow this and it will soon turn left and start switch backing up the steep hillside. There is a lower drop in point to the canyon near the top of this climb. I will only describe the upper drop in. Once you have reached the top of the switchbacks the trail continues up and along the drainage which you will soon be descending. Continue up the path and across a couple of scree slopes and you will reenter the trees. The slope on your left will start to ease up and around 34.2488N, 117.5763W you should be able to drop in down the dirt slope on your left. Once at the bottom head down stream. You will quickly arrive at the first rappel. You will come to a large boulder, stop and suit up for the rest of the canyon here.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>After suiting up head around the left of the boulder and down; you will come to the top of the first waterfall. \n<\/p><p><b>R1<\/b>: ~35ft from two bolts LDC. There is a slung stone out of flow RDC.\n<\/p><p><b>R2<\/b>: ~80ft from: a. two bolts LDC descending into a hanging granite bowl from which you can continue to rappel or climb down the rest of the way or b. a slung tree root (ldc). If using the tree root, be mindful of abrasive edges. Depending on the season, this bowl can be a swim or it can be ankle deep.\n<\/p><p>Continue down canyon. You will be hiking for a short while now. Maybe 1\/4 of a mile further downstream, you will arrive at the main falls. This is a sequence of three back-to-back rappels.\n<\/p><p><b>R3<\/b>: 85ft a. RDC off bolts and chains in the water course or b. LDC off a tree or C. avoiding water RDC off tree(this route will bypass R4 and is about 140ft. This is the first of three consecutive falls and descends into a hanging bowl. The bowl can again be a complete swim, or a knee deep walk.\n<\/p><p>It is advisable to set an extra 15' of rope on R3 and stay on rappel to reach the R4 bolted anchor. It may also be a good idea to tie a knot in the end of the rope to protect this transition (this R3 to R4 transition has been the source of a fall - see incident report from May 2019).\n<\/p><p><b>R4<\/b>: 75ft from two bolts RDC. Access to this anchor require exposed maneuvers in the watercourse and should be protected given algae and flow conditions (see above).\n<\/p><p><b>R5<\/b>: 95ft from a. bolts RDC into the main flow (there is a bolt to clip into) b. a tree RDC to avoid the flow.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>To exit, head downstream to where it meets with the main drainage.
