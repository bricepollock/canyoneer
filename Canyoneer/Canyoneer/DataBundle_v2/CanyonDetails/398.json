Descend into the canyon and head upstream a few minutes  At the fork, head up the left fork past 2 rocky water slides and look for a ridge with a relatively easy incline (looking at 7.5 minute topo, it is inline with the word \"Canyon\" at 34.18584, -118.05991).  Hike up it with one switch back to the right and you'll find a well pruned trail to summit the ridge starting at 34.18556, -118.05990, and steeply climbing up 440 vertical feet.  Once you hit the ridge (divides Hastings and Bailey, just a little brush on top), head uphill (North) to 34.18900, -118.06299 (3220 feet on the 7.5 minute topo).  Traverse 30 feet off the ridge to a trimmed bush, then descend steeply down holding onto bushes until you reach a gully and a short wall.  Traverse right into the main Gully which is Hasting canyon.  Continue down the steep scree and dirt to 34.18783, -118.06460 (2800 feet on the 7.5 minute topo).  NOTE: KML updated 6DEC2023 to be more accurate. Don't follow the old KML file exactly, it's not accurate, it leads you up a brushy and rocky gully, and it will cliff you out on the drop-in.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>There are 3 20’ downclimbs before the first rappel.
