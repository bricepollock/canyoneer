  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>Sabertooth is completely downclimbable if you are very good at\ndownclimbing.</p>\n<p>To get into the canyon, you can probably downclimb right at the head\nof the slot. We did not do this because it was full of water and we were\ntrying to stay dry. A second option would be to use a fiddlestick off of\na bush on the LDC side.</p>\n<p>The first section looks intimidating, but it is just contains some\nmellow R-minus stemming.</p>\n<p>In the second section you will encounter some R rated stemming about\n25 feet off of the deck. The movement is never very difficult.</p>\n<p>Soon you will arrive at an AWESOME subway section. Take your time\nhere and take some photos.</p>\n<p>The final drop will be a 25 foot rappel for most people. It is\ndownclimbable by the very skilled. If you absolutely must leave webbing,\nbe sure to situate it in a way that does not leave a rope groove,\nsomething that should be easy to figure out.</p>\n<p>The finish is a simple walk-out into West Canyon.</p>\n<p>Time: We completed this loop in 4 hours in exploration mode (slow and\nvery careful). I would expect to spend about 2.5 hours on this route\nagain.</p>\n<p>Rappels: One possible 30 foot rappel at the start. One probable 25\nfoot rappel at the end.</p>\n<p>Mandatory Equipment: Fiddlestick, 1X100 feet of rope, 50 feet of\nwebbing, standard rappelling gear.</p>\n<p>Neoprene: None required. You can stay completely dry if you are\nexceptionally good at stemming.</p>\n<p>Please play fair and do not add bolts to this route. We were able to\nghost Sabertooth with almost zero effort.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<p>Hiking in this area requires a permit from the Navajo Nation. I\nrecommend mailing your permit request a few weeks in advance, along with\na very polite letter explaining your trip itinerary.
