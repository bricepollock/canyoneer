  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>Brides Canyon is near the Gooney Bird Rock Tower off the Gemini\nBridges Road. The canyon is interesting and pretty by Moab standards. If\nyou are used to North Wash or Zion and expecting a challenge, you'll be\ndisappointed that this is more of a hike with rappels. It never really\nslots up. There are a lot of rock towers and arches in the vicinity as\nwell. Bring webbing and at least 100 feet of rope.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p><strong>Trailhead</strong></p>\n<p>From Highway 191 north of Moab, turn west on the Gemini Bridges Road\n(BLM 261). After a short distance, turn left staying on the road to\nGemini Bridges. After driving this road about 4 miles from the highway,\nturn left and follow this side road to the end. High clearance is\nrecommended. The impressive rock tower at the trailhead is named The\nBride, thus the name of the canyon.</p>\n<p>Google Maps has directions to Bride Canyon. There are several\nofficial campsites near the trailhead, but you are supposed to bring\nyour own toilet.</p>\n<p><strong>To the Canyon Head</strong></p>\n<p>From the dirt road, head to the obvious weakness in the north-facing\ncliffs. Scramble up the least steep part.</p>\n<p>You will quickly encounter a rather tricky upclimb. Unless you are a\nhighly skilled rock climber, you will need to do a shoulder stand to\nascend this obstacle. The first person should take a rope, meat anchor\nfrom the top, and allow the next persons to use the rope to ascend.</p>\n<p>Above this obstacle, stay to your right through a field of boulders,\nthrough the only obvious viable route to the top of the cliffs. There is\na class III move here where, again, the leader can take the rope and set\nan anchor for subsequent climbers if necessary.</p>\n<p>Here, you'll top out on the plateau.</p>\n<p>Head northeast to the start of the slot. There is an easy mountain\nbike trail to guide you for 2/3rds of the way.</p>\n<p>When you get to the canyon, walk down a gentle slope, stay right, and\nascend past a large outcrop. It's here that a GPS route is\nindispensable. Past this outcrop, scramble down several hundred feet on\ncanyon right to the canyon floor.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>Enter the canyon and start bushwhacking. You will quickly come to a\ndifficult downclimb into a pool, which may be filled or dry. A partner\nassist with a handline works well. In winter, if you don't want to wade\nin icy water, you can retreat up canyon and climb the north wall and\nfollow the ledges before rappelling back in the canyon just below the\npool.</p>\n<p>After the pool there are some narrows before reaching the first\nrappel, 30' or so. This rappel is two stage, 20 feet and 10 feet. There\nis a tree to use as an anchor, currently without webbing. There are some\ninteresting short side slots to explore in the area.</p>\n<p>Walk down through pretty narrows. Rappel 2 is about 50 feet off of\nwebbing on a tree.</p>\n<p>The next drop has an easy bypass on the right.</p>\n<p>The final rappel is a 50' rap off a deadman anchor we built.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>After rappel 3, follow the obvious trail down canyon and back to your\nvehicle.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<p>June 19: One big deep pool at the third rappel was full of green\nbubbly water. We were able to swing left to get off rappel and keep the\nwater to thigh deep. There was no other water that could not easily be\navoided. 7 rappels, 2 with freehang, several good downclimbs and/or\npack-drag opportunities, and nicely sculpted walls made for a very nice\ncanyon. A Top 10 canyon in Moab. We also came down the North Fork that\nis a slot with a 30 foot downclimb and some stemming, nice but very\nshort.</p>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n<p>Many good canyons in the area have been kept out of the guidebooks.\nWill see how long that lasts now that this one is online.</p>\n",
