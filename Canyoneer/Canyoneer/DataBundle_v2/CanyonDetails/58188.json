The canyon is interesting and pretty by Moab standards. If you are used to North Wash or Zion and expecting a challenge, you'll be disappointed that this is more of a hike with rappels. It never really slots up.\nThere are a lot of rock towers and arches in the vicinity as well. Bring webbing and at least 100 feet of rope.\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p><b>Trailhead<\/b>\n<\/p><p>From Highway 191 north of Moab, turn west on the Gemini Bridges Road (BLM 261).  After a short distance, turn left staying on the road to Gemini Bridges. After driving this road about 4 miles from the highway, turn left and follow this side road to the end.  High clearance is recommended.  The impressive rock tower at the trailhead is named The Bride, thus the name of the canyon.\n<\/p><p>Google Maps has directions to Bride Canyon. There are several official campsites near the trailhead, but you are supposed to bring your own toilet.\n<\/p><p><b>To the Canyon Head<\/b>  \n<\/p><p>From the dirt road, head to the obvious weakness in the north-facing cliffs.

We were able to swing left to get off rappel and keep the water to thigh deep.  There was no other water that could not easily be avoided. 7 rappels, 2 with freehang, several good downclimbs and\/or pack-drag opportunities, and nicely sculpted walls made for a very nice canyon.  A Top 10 canyon in Moab.  We also came down the North Fork that is a slot with a 30 foot downclimb and some stemming, nice but very short.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Background\">Background<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Many good canyons in the area have been kept out of the guidebooks.
