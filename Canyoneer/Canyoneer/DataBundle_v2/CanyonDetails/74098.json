{"rappelCountMin":5,"description":"<div class=\"mw-content-ltr mw-parser-output\" lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><p>A short route that packs a punch. This is a gully style route that follows a coconino fault line down to West fork. The exit is comparable to Flintstone and Barney sneak exits as far as difficulty. The route doesn't stand up to the sculpted slots nearby, but still makes for a fun day. \n<\/p><p><br \/>\nYou will be required to build anchors, route find, and test your limits on the exit with loose terrain and vicious vegetation.\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>The route starts to the right of the limestone capped fin.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>The rappels come one after another (BAM BAM) \n<\/p><p>Up to 6 rappels, max 110'. \n<\/p><p>Bring extra webbing and be prepared to build anchors.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Scramble up ridge between exit and exit drainage to bypass large drops. \nThe first half or 500 feet is relatively easy. Progress will be haulted by towering coconino cliffs in the center of the exit ridge. At the large walls start working your way left. It is likely that you can avoid the chimney by staying left and navigating through steep and bushy terrain. We opted for the small chimney. \nAfter the chimney surmount the ledge and follow it to a faint game trail. Follow the game trail high on the right side and continue up and right through locust bush. As you gain elevation the brush eases up and you will connect with the Barney Sneak. Follow easy terrain up and back to your vehicle.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Red_tape\">Red tape<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Beta_sites\">Beta sites<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Background\">Background<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Established by Eric Moorcroft, Kevin Iosue, and Jason First on Oct 24.2022. \nNo Signs of previous exploration.\n<\/p>\n\n\n<\/div>","technicalRating":3,"months":["May","Jun","Jul","Aug","Sep"],"name":"BAM BAM Canyon","url":"https:\/\/ropewiki.com\/BAM_BAM_Canyon","timeRating":"III","riskRating":null,"latitude":35.0174,"id":74098,"geojson":{"type":"FeatureCollection","features":[{"type":"Feature","properties":{"name":"Chimney"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[[-111.791082,35.018252,0]]}},{"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[[-111.791809,35.015832,0]]},"type":"Feature","properties":{"name":"(End)"}},{"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[[-111.793325,35.019139,0]]},"type":"Feature","properties":{"name":"R6"}},{"properties":{"name":"R1 "},"geometry":{"coordinates":[[-111.795298,35.017349,0]],"type":"Point"},"type":"Feature"},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[[-111.795188,35.017503,0]]},"properties":{"name":"R2"}},{"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[[-111.79507,35.017436,0]]},"properties":{"name":"R3"},"type":"Feature"},{"properties":{"name":"R4  "},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[[-111.794787,35.017854,0]]},"type":"Feature"},{"geometry":{"coordinates":[[-111.794669,35.017793,0]],"type":"Point"},"properties":{"name":"R5 "},"type":"Feature"},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"coordinates":[[-111.7969459953747,35.01538894317521,0]],"type":"Point"},"properties":{"name":"Park"}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"coordinates":[[-111.79170784654164,35.01583386888415,0],[-111.79156810933935,35.01590518509223,0],[-111.79150641853198,35.01594252915101,0],[-111.79134118163007,35.015986086360215,0],[-111.79113909602168,35.01605177076238,0],[-111.79091480589024,35.01611853750878,0],[-111.7904912665017,35.016222782944965,0],[-111.79037456491187,35.01624406918436,0],[-111.78979963458005,35.01684561860026,0],[-111.7896252909941,35.016937879300585,0],[-111.78958237564986,35.01707846683427,0],[-111.7899498382849,35.01716853059599,0],[-111.79004371560042,35.01710263029225,0],[-111.79023027171753,35.017433766379625,0],[-111.79030537356996,35.017789625947835,0],[-111.7902436846248,35.01779518272189,0],[-111.79014055459677,35.01804058576738,0],[-111.79012043802915,35.01806365061517,0],[-111.79008959262548,35.01807573219952,0],[-111.79015933005986,35.01820203956529,0],[-111.79020425927094,35.01826261510857,0],[-111.79021767031603,35.01820440395518,0],[-111.79049947061685,35.01828752960994,0],[-111.79051556387095,35.01822822015057,0],[-111.79107904443813,35.018236850394324,0],[-111.79122144196869,35.01823487779935,0],[-111.79136762236001,35.01830517048147,0],[-111.79136842489244,35.01822538236734,0],[-111.79187085796232,35.01854574874925,0],[-111.7919903856972,35.018587250494654,0],[-111.79228364148744,35.01881292297511,0],[-111.79229110479356,35.01880749188711,0],[-111.79230317473414,35.01874598617137,0],[-111.79228976368906,35.01869216863215,0],[-111.7924667196749,35.018842927643156,0],[-111.7926604082166,35.019039386457244,0],[-111.79266979594816,35.01911187507154,0],[-111.79327107860956,35.01941766533527,0],[-111.79334081604398,35.019371536397024,0],[-111.79330058290874,35.019156579993364,0]],"type":"LineString"},"properties":{"stroke":"#F0F000","name":"Exit"}},{"properties":{"stroke":"#00CD00","name":""},"geometry":{"coordinates":[[-111.79693106330889,35.01537413298704,0],[-111.79683103233403,35.015701590635906,0],[-111.79677546964741,35.015985738431965,0],[-111.7966014146805,35.01666355106842,0]],"type":"LineString"},"type":"Feature"},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"LineString","coordinates":[[-111.79657508355379,35.01664526721975,0],[-111.79595022617833,35.0170374883288,0],[-111.79527640342714,35.017322555254374,0],[-111.79527083431142,35.0173308222694,0],[-111.79518546704232,35.0174902961912,0],[-111.7950754964727,35.017427691150246,0],[-111.79479967595172,35.017818331200125,0],[-111.7947782182796,35.01784029778169,0],[-111.79466754198076,35.01779264166165,0],[-111.79437035415503,35.01803485897189,0],[-111.79371535778047,35.01849117628478,0],[-111.79324865341187,35.018877784077006,0],[-111.79329156875612,35.019132592758844,0]]},"properties":{"name":"","stroke":"#FF0000"}}]},"rappelCountMax":6,"longitude":-111.7953,"rappelLongestMeters":33.53,"vehicle":null,"permit":"No","waterRating":"A","quality":2,"shuttleSeconds":null,"version":"76162b9bac58fa605edbb6c10024438b69585f64cfc9bd4a69cad7c8e1fe7987"}
