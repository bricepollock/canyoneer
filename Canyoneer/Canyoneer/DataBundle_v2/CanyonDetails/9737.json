  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>This is the section of the East Fork of the Kaweah from the park\nentrance down to the Oak Grove Bridge. While it contains a fair bit of\nuninteresting boulder hopping, and is not nearly as continuous of a\ncanyon as the section below the Oak Grove Bridge, it is punctuated by\nsome pretty awesome features, some bigger jumps (up to say 25 ft), an\nepic slide, and the most potentially dangerous section of narrows along\nthe EF Kaweah. While this section did not require any rappelling on our\npart when we descended it, some slides, jumps and other things we did\nmight be considered sketchy, and some people might want ropes. There are\nalso sections of pretty committed gorge, where once you jump, you will\nneed to continue down canyon.</p>\n<p>While the water and air are colder than the lower sections, if it's\nsay over 100 degrees in Three Rivers, you should be pretty comfortable\nsans-wetsuit.</p>\n<p>On the note of the sketchy narrows, this requires substantially lower\nflows than the lower East Fork section does. It was right at 100cfs on\nthis gauge: <a\nhref=\"http://www.dreamflows.com/graphs/day.103.php\">http://www.dreamflows.com/graphs/day.103.php</a>\nwhen I went down. I'd consider that a good maximum, assuming that flows\nare not affected by rain. If Mineral King has been getting rain, and the\nEast Fork is brown, you'll want to stay out. While the rest of the\ncanyon is fairly straight forward, the sketchy part involves a tricky\nmove to avoid what appears to be a substantial hydraulic. You should\nprobably know how to swim out of a hole before you start down this\ncanyon.</p>\n<p>With the final narrows being definitely the most exciting part of the\nroute (though you do sort of miss out on some cool stuff up top), it\nmight be desirable to just do that section. There is a road you can\naccess this with, it may or may not be private. If you try it, update\nthe page or let me know what the status is so that i can update it\nmyself. I'll include directions for that too. Just look below the\n----------- in the approach and descent posts. Note that I haven't done\nit, this is based on satellite images. Follow it up the hill.\nApproximately a little less than a mile up the road, a smaller road\nshould cut off down a ridge. Head down some switchbacks to the river,\nand you should come out just before the walls rise up for the final\nnarrow gorge.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>From Three Rivers, drive up the road towards Mineral King and leave\none car at the Oak Grove Bridge. At the Park Entrance there is some room\nto park in front of the trash cans. I'm unclear on whether or not you\nshould pay a park entrance to park here, so if you want to be sure,\nthere are some good pull offs maybe 100 yards back down the road.</p>\n<p>From the park entrance look at the east side of the ridge for a trail\ncutting down below the house. It's a decent trail at first, if a bit\nsteep. Then whoever was clearing it decided they had better things to\ndo, and it gets really overgrown with chamois. If you just put your arms\nup and power through it, it's pretty simple. Watch for poison oak below\nonce the chamois opens up.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>No shuttle if you're just trying to hit the bottom. From Oak Grove\nBridge, look up the hill on the south side of the river. A trail will\ntake you up to the flume. Follow it left (east (upstream)) to where it\ngoes under a dirt road.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>Suit up and head down canyon. Fairly immediately you should come to a\npretty sizeable waterfall. There bottom is shallow. You could rappel\nfrom a tree on the left, or keep scrambling on the left ledge to bypass\nthe drop.</p>\n<p>A ways down from here is a pretty awesome jump that requires a good\nrunning start to clear a hydraulic. It also might be shallow where the\nwhite water is... I'm not sure, because I didn't mess with it.</p>\n<p>Down from here Coffeepot Canyon comes in from the left (as far as I\nknow it's not anything exciting for canyoneering). Just downstream of\nCoffeepot there is a fun little jump, followed immediately by a really\nnice slide. The slide lands in a bit of a hydraulic, but at the water\nlevels where you should be in there it doesn't seem to cause much of a\nproblem. Also there is a bit of a crease in the slide. I wasn't sure how\nhard of a bump it would cause, so we started at the crease rather than\nthe drop of the slide. My suspicion is that starting at the top of the\nslide would be more awesome, but I could be wrong in which case it would\nhurt a bit. The slide is easily bypassed on the right.</p>\n<p>A bit down from here you'll find a drop that you probably don't want\nanything to do with. The water falls off into rocks, and then shoots\nacross the canyon into a wall. You can bypass this pretty easily up on\nthe right.</p>\n<p>Things start to die down a bit, though there are still some fun bits.\nA little downstream is a fun jump with a view of a picnic table and a\nfire pit straight ahead a little ways up. If you're starting to feel\nlike there is too much water for what comes later, or you're having\nother issues, this would be a good place to bail. It's probably private\nproperty, and someone might get mad at you, but it's better than trying\nto bushwhack through chamois.</p>\n<p>More boulder hopping follows. Some giant fallen boulders make for\nsome cool falls and cave like features, followed by more boulder\nhopping. If you're someone who dislikes hopping down slippery rocks, you\nprobably won't enjoy this section. Eventually it opens up to where you\naren't really in much of a canyon at all.</p>\n<p>If you're observant you may notice a bit of a road bed on the left.\nThis will present you with another option to bail. If you hike up this\nroad up some switchbacks, hang a right, it will take you down to the\nflume which you can follow left back to your car. Soon after you pass\nthis road staying in the river, the canyon walls will reappear.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>A couple turns of walking over slippery rocks between walls an you'll\nfind yourself above a pretty awesome jump on the right, with falls on\nthe left. Jump away and head downstream.</p>\n<p>A little bit later there are no more boulders, just bedrock, sliding\naway in front of you. I'm not sure that sliding down this would go well,\nbut you should be able to walk on the right side pretty easily. If you\ncan't, then don't go! You are about to commit yourself.</p>\n<p>Just at the bottom of the slide there is a drop off onto a rock. The\nright side where you are standing is in front of a bowl of water that is\nabout waist deep in the center, where the water is landing. I'm not sure\nwhat the best way down is, but it's short enough of a drop to where\njumping with good form should be okay, even if you only land in 1 foot\nof water. Once down you can swim down a fun little sliding rapid.</p>\n<p>Climb up onto the large chock stone and look down. Water pours of\neither side of this boulder into a bowl somewhere beneath your feet, and\nthen into a hydraulic just downstream. At the levels we were in there,\nthe hydraulic looked potentially sticky, but not something you couldn't\nswim out of. If you're standing on this rock, and it doesn't look like\nyou can get down, I guess you could stand there, blowing your whistle\nand waving at cars on the road in the distance in hopes that they would\nnotice you. I doubt they will.</p>\n<p>Assuming things look good (good being relative, I was a little scared\ndoing this and it was a bit easier than it looked), you can squeeze\nyourself into the down canyon right falls, stem down as far as you can,\nand plop into the bowl. There is an eddy in the bowl that will likely\npush you back under the boulder, freaking out your friends up above.\nThere's a rock you can get some purchase on with your feet to push\nyourself forward, and climb up onto the slippery ledge on the down\ncanyon right end of the pool. Hang out here to help your friends up, and\nthen traverse along the right wall above the hole, and jump in after\nit.</p>\n<p>Downstream is another drop, which looks to be a bit sketchy. Climb up\non the downcanyon right side of it, and walk out this ledge to a good\nspot for a nice ~25 foot jump down into the water.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>You'll come up to a dam in a bit downstream. Here you have an option.\nIf you're ready to be done, climb the ladder on the left and follow the\nflume trail, cross a road, and head down to the Oak Grove bridge\n(looking for a path that cuts off right at an opening in the wire fence\nat a telephone pole.) If you would like more canyon, you can stay in the\nwater down to the bridge, where you'll find a few small jumps and\nslides, followed by a short steep trail up to your car with some poison\noak.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<p>The roads coming into this route from the North is almost certainly\nprivate. the one from the South might be. Also you might need a park\npass to park at the entrance? I don't know.</p>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n",
