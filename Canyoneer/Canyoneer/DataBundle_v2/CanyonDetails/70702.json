  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>Very flat and open canyon, but due to the high waterflow it is quite\ntechnical.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>The first waterfall can be seen immediatly from the bridge.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>The first section starts with a dangerous pool and a natural arch\nwhich both haven't been abseiled through. Then another small 3 Meter\nstep. Walk for a about 300m, then comes a 5m Fall which can be\ndownclimbed and jumped (the last 2 meters). Again a few minutes of\nwalking, and you'll get to the last section made of 2 Waterfalls, the\nfirst one could be done as a jump if the current isn't too strong.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>Exit on the right side and walk up to the road.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n<p>The river has a water level measurement. First descent was done at\n500L/s, but sometimes the flow goes down to 150, so it should be\npossible to go through the arch.</p>\n",
