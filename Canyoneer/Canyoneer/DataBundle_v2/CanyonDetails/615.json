If linking Bear and <a href=\"\/w\/index.php?title=Sundance_Canyon&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Sundance Canyon (page does not exist)\">Sundance<\/a> canyons together, this sneak exit is a good way to shave off some time \/ mileage and avoid doing the bigger exit hike (via Point Trail) from West Clear Creek twice. There is a road where the approach is shown on the map. If you park at the campsite, you can follow the drainage directly back without hiking up to the road.\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>As long as the roads are dry, a passenger car will get you there...the road is rough, however, and a higher clearance vehicle is recommended.\n<\/p><p>Leave the road and hike down into a side drainage.
