  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>Fire Canyon is an exceptionally beautiful canyon that is infrequently\nvisited. It has a fairly short technical section but requires a\nrelatively long hike at both the front end, 1.5 miles from the Cassidy\nArch trailhead, and then 2.5 miles back. The technical section features\n5-7 rappels up to 125 feet. The hiking along Frying Pan Trail affords\nstunning scenery in both directions.</p>\n<p>Fire Canyon can be combined with one or more of the Wives, if you\nhike from the Cohab Canyon trailhead, or with Cassidy Arch Canyon if you\nhike from the Cassidy Arch trailhead. Fire + Cassidy makes for a great\nouting that will take most of a day.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>Start hiking from either the Cassidy Arch trailhead or the Cohab\nCanyon trailhead. Leave the Frying Pan trail at the point mentioned on\nthe track. From there, route-find towards the canyon through uneven\nterrain until you drop into the canyon, which at this point will be a\nsandy wash. Some minor downclimbs may be required.</p>\n<p>If you walk a few minutes up canyon, you will find several\ninteresting slide slots to explore before continuing your descent.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>From the drop-in point, continue down canyon until you encounter a\nlarge bowl-shaped drop. This is R1.</p>\n<p><strong>R1</strong>: 125ft from a stout pine tree above a crack in\nthe center of the drop.</p>\n<p><strong>R2</strong>: 45ft from a small tree above a wide ledge. A bit\nof an awkward start, and beware a crack that might make the rope pull\nmore challenging.</p>\n<p><strong>R3</strong>: 75ft from a boulder pinch into an enclosed\nchamber.</p>\n<p><strong>R4</strong>: 80ft from a boulder pinch into a slot carved out\nof the bottom of the canyon floor. You can use the slot to continue down\ncanyon.</p>\n<p><strong>R5</strong>: 20ft from a pinch into a chamber that might have\na pool. This might look downclimbable at first, but the LDC wall\ndisappears about ten feet off the ground.</p>\n<p><strong>R6</strong>: 15ft from a chockstone into a pool. Could also\nbe an elevator downclimb for the skilled.</p>\n<p><strong>R7</strong>: 25ft from a hanging chockstone into a pool.\nAnchor is reachable via an easy friction downclimb. The entire elevator\ncould be a downclimb, although the lower walls are fairly slick.</p>\n<p>The last obstacle in the canyon is a 5ft downclimb into a pool,\npossibly waist deep.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>Continue down canyon until you reach the Frying Pan trail. Follow it\nback to either the Cohab Canyon trailhead or the Cassidy Arch\ntrailhead.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red Tape</h2>\n<h3 id=\"permits\">Permits</h3>\n<p>A permit is required for any and all canyoneering within the\nboundaries of Capitol Reef National Park. Permits have a group-size\nlimit that varies depending on the canyon or route. A separate permit is\nrequired for each canyoneering route. Currently, there is no quota limit\nnor permit cost, though that is likely to change at some point in the\nfuture. Permits can be obtained onsite through a self-serve kiosk\nlocated just outside of the visitor center or by sending and email to\ncare_permits@nps.gov using the following format:</p>\n<p><strong>Subject:</strong> Name of canyoneering route and date you\nwill be canyoneering.</p>\n<p><strong>Email Body:</strong> Date of visit (single day only):\nCanyoneering route (single route only): Number of people: Vehicle\nlocation: Number of motorized vehicles: Vehicle description(s):</p>\n<p>If you plan to camp overnight as part of a canyoneering trip, you are\nrequired to obtain a free backcountry permit, available at the visitor\ncenter.</p>\n<h3 id=\"additional_access_information\">Additional Access\nInformation:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>CRNP canyoneering permit information webpage: <a\nhref=\"https://www.nps.gov/care/planyourvisit/canyoneering.htm\">https://www.nps.gov/care/planyourvisit/canyoneering.htm</a></li>\n<li>Other: <a\nhref=\"http://www.americancanyoneers.org/access-capitol-reef/\">http://www.americancanyoneers.org/access-capitol-reef/</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"group_size_limit\">Group-Size Limit:</h3>\n<p>Canyoneering groups are limited to a maximum of 8 people for this\nCanyon.</p>\n<p>Groups larger than 8 or 12 sharing the same affiliation (school,\nchurch, club, scout group, family, friends, etc., or combination\nthereof) may divide into groups smaller than 8 or 12, provided they do\nnot occupy the same canyon, drainage, general area or the same route on\nthe same day.</p>\n<h3 id=\"park_entrance_fee\">Park Entrance Fee:</h3>\n<p>The Scenic drive is the only area of Capitol Reef where an entry fee\nor park pass is required. Passes can be attained at the visitor center\nor at a self-pay kiosk at the start of the scenic drive. Fees are good\nfor seven days and can be found here: <a\nhref=\"http://www.nps.gov/care/planyourvisit/fees.htm\">http://www.nps.gov/care/planyourvisit/fees.htm</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<p><a\nhref=\"https://www.roadtripryan.com/go/t/utah/capitol-reef/fire-canyon\">https://www.roadtripryan.com/go/t/utah/capitol-reef/fire-canyon</a></p>\n<p><a\nhref=\"http://bluugnome.com/cyn_route/cap-reef/cap-reef_ex-wife/cap-reef_ex-wife.aspx\">http://bluugnome.com/cyn_route/cap-reef/cap-reef_ex-wife/cap-reef_ex-wife.aspx</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<p><a\nhref=\"http://www.bogley.com/forum/showthread.php?78417-FireWife-Capitol-Reef-NP-09-23-2018\">http://www.bogley.com/forum/showthread.php?78417-FireWife-Capitol-Reef-NP-09-23-2018</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n",
