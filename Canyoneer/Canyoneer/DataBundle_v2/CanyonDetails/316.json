This takes about 30 minutes.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>The upper section starts with a couple 20-25 feet downclimbs and then enters a continuous narrows with about half a dozen chimney downclimbs ranging from 20-40 feet, and one exposed slab downclimb. Thus the PG rating. A sandtrap anchor can be used to rappel the more difficult downclimbs.\n<\/p><p>Pothole section can be done with one 280 foot rope anchored off the small Single-Leaf Ash tree on canyon left and will get you all the way down the string of nine potholes. A Fiddle Stick is needed or the rope pull is unlikely. Alternatively, the pothole section can be broken up into 2 or 3 rappels using a water trap or sand trap. The penultimate rappel is off a double chockstone anchor.\n<\/p><p>After the pothole section come two scenic free-hang rappels The first is 65 feet off two chockstones. If this anchor is blown out then the anchor options are scant. The anchor challenges are the Class 4 rating.  The final rappel is 150 feet off a large rectangular block. Alternatively, an oak tree DCL may be a tempting anchor but beware that using this anchor will deposit you into heavy brush at the bottom.  After this are two easy downclimbs and a 5 minute boulder hop to the creek.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>A pleasant creek walk for one mile down South Fork Ticaboo Creek past Off-The-Hook and then up a drainage on the right to a fin that takes you up to the top layer. Be sure to study the topo maps to pick the proper fin as many surrounding fins will dead end before reaching the top.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Red_tape\">Red tape<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Beta_sites\">Beta sites<\/h2><\/div>\n<ul><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http:\/\/bluugnome.com\/cyn_route\/ticaboo\/ticaboo_double-entendre\/ticaboo_double-entendre.aspx\">BluuGnome.com<\/a> &#160;: Double Entendre Canyon<\/li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http:\/\/ropewiki.com\/User:Super_Amazing_Map?id=Double_Entendre_-_Lake_Powell_Area\">Super Amazing Map<\/a> &#160;: Double Entendre<\/li><\/ul>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Background\">Background<\/h2><\/div>\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nParsed by mw‐api‐ext.codfw.main‐6779cc57fc‐xxrrq\nCached time: 20240914192012\nCache expiry: 2592000\nReduced expiry: false\nComplications: [show‐toc]\nCPU time usage: 0.004 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.005 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 21\/1000000\nPost‐expand include size: 0\/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 0\/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 2\/100\nExpensive parser function count: 0\/500\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0\/20\nUnstrip post‐expand size: 0\/5000000 bytes\nNumber of Wikibase entities loaded: 0\/400\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%    0.000      1 -total\n-->\n<\/div>"}
