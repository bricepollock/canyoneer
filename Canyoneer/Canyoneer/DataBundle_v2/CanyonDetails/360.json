  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>Pine Creek is a fantastic introduction to Zion canyons. It's easy to\naccess and return, and hosts spectacular (and varied) scenery. There are\ntypically plenty of permits available, and often combined with nearby <a\nhref=\"Keyhole_Canyon_(Zion_National_Park)\" title=\"wikilink\">Keyhole\nCanyon (Zion National Park)</a>.</p>\n<p>Depending on the season, the canyon can be quite chilly or pleasantly\ncool. In March or April you could be swimming down dark corridors, teeth\nchattering in a 7mm wetsuit. By June that very same corridor could be\ndry walking passage and a shortie 2mm wetsuit too hot, or completely\nunnecessary.</p>\n<p>For better or worse, you pay for the easy access to this canyon with\nthe immediacy of the Zion-Mount Carmel Tunnel. The wilderness character\nof this beautiful gorge is subtly marred by the sound of automotive\ntraffic passing above you.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>To setup the car shuttle, leave your exit vehicle at the \"second\nswitchback\" then drive your group east through the Zion-Mount Carmel\nTunnel. After exiting the tunnel, park immediately in the first parking\nlot on the right. If no parking is available here, drop everyone else\noff and then continue driving east until a parking spot on the side of\nthe road can be found. The drop-in is a concrete runoff spillway just\noff the parking lot's sidewalk. Don't walk down the dirt hillside, this\ncontributes to erosion (and the park staff will ask you to use the\nconcrete \"path\").</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>Pine Creek begins with some a few small down-climb problems and you\nquickly come across R1.</p>\n<p><strong>R1</strong> Is no longer a two stage rappel. New anchors have\nbeen installed below R1 to mitigate previous rope pull issues. There are\ntechnically 8 rappels for this canyon now.</p>\n<p>After a series of small downclimbs, you arrive at R2 and R3.</p>\n<p><strong>R2</strong> is a short, somewhat-awkward rappel from jammed\nlogs into a shallow pool the pours out onto R3. There is limited space\nout of the pool at the top of R3, so be sure to sequence well in order\nto avoid forcing people to wait while standing in the pool at the base\nof R2.</p>\n<p><strong>R3</strong> is the Cathedral rappel, perhaps the most\nbeautiful rappel of the canyon. Accessing the anchor LDC may be tricky;\nconsider using a meat anchor to belay someone out to the anchor to rig\nit. This rappel often has a partially-swimming disconnect and then a\nshort full swim across a very cold pool. Depending on time of day, there\nmay be some small bit of sunlight penetrating the canyon for people to\nwarm up in, but often this area is just cold. Be careful of thermal\nmanagement issues.</p>\n<p>After R3 comes the bulk of the canyon, full of small downclimbs and\nnarrow water-filled passages. At one point, there is a short, very\nawkward rappel off a large tree into what is often a pool. At another\npoint, there is a tricky downclimb down a narrow slot with old tree\nroots that is not immediately obvious. Finally, you emerge into\nsunlight.</p>\n<p><strong>R4</strong> comes at the end of the boulder field. It used to\nbe anchored RDC from a single glue in anchor about head high if you are\nstanding on top of the boulder. That boulder has since washed away and\nthe anchor is now unreachable. Use webbing around a log or small boulder\nto rappel 12-15'. Do not jump; even full of water this part was less\nthan 3' deep.</p>\n<p><strong>R5</strong> is located a short distance after exiting the\nnarrow section of the canyon, anchored RDC. Be careful of rope abrasion\ndue to bouncing on rappel.</p>\n<p><strong>R6</strong> is the final, largest rappel. There are multiple\noptions for this rappel.</p>\n<p>One option is to climb up onto the large slab LDC and locate the\nanchor down a small weakness in the slab right at the edge of a very\nlarge dropoff. This anchor can be intimidating both to reach and to\nstart rappelling on. A meat anchor is advisable for reaching the bolts,\nand the trick to a controlled start is to bring your rappel device as\nclose to the anchor as possible before starting, and then sitting back\nonto it while walking sideways over the dropoff. Don't be surprised when\nyou slowly swing to the left after starting to descend. The majority of\nthis rappel is free-hanging, and it is slightly under 100' long.</p>\n<p>Another option is to look slightly RDC of center canyon and find an\nanchor that drops you into a pool below.</p>\n<p>Downclimb (scary) or meat anchor the small remaining drop (~25 ft)\ninto the grotto. Alternatively, use a longer amount of rope (Maybe\nenough for a ~140 ft rappel) and rappel into the grotto off the R6\nanchor.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>Follow the canyon downstream, downclimbing and routefinding around\nand between the boulders. When in doubt, look for tracks to show the\neasiest way, although they are not always readily visible. This section\ncan feel long and exhausting.</p>\n<p>Don't be tempted to exit the canyon early, remember you're headed for\nthe second switch back, not third which is much higher in elevation.\nMuch of your time in the canyon will be spent in the non-technical exit,\nwhich in of itself is quite beautiful and contains many fun boulder\ngardens and down-climb puzzles. The canyon will gradually level and\nfinally you'll find yourself just 80 feet below the second switchback\nparking area. Find the well established use trail and follow it up to\nthe stone wall visible from the canyon floor. While traveling down\ncanyon, look for a very large pool with a large rock upstream of it that\nlooks like an attractive place to jump from. This is where the trail out\nof the canyon to the road starts. The retaining walls of the exit\nparking lot are visible from the watercourse if you keep an eye out for\nthem about 30 ft above the watercourse and DCL.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<p>A <a\nhref=\"https://zionpermits.nps.gov/wilderness.cfm?TripTypeID=3\">canyoneering\nday-trip permit</a> issued by Zion National Park is required for this\ncanyon.</p>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><img src=\"rwl_en.png\" title=\"rwl_en.png\" alt=\"rwl_en.png\" /><a\nhref=\"http://bluugnome.com/cyn_route/zion/zion_pine-creek/zion_pine-creek.aspx\">BluuGnome.com</a>\n: Pine Creek Canyon</li>\n<li><img src=\"rwl_en.png\" title=\"rwl_en.png\" alt=\"rwl_en.png\" /><a\nhref=\"http://brennen.caltech.edu/swhikes/pinecr.htm\">Chris Brennen's\nAdventure Hikes (Southwest)</a> : Pine Creek</li>\n<li><img src=\"rwl_en.png\" title=\"rwl_en.png\" alt=\"rwl_en.png\" /><a\nhref=\"http://roadtripryan.com/go/t/utah/zion/pine-creek-canyon\">RoadTripRyan.com</a>\n: Pine Creek</li>\n<li><img src=\"rwl_en.png\" title=\"rwl_en.png\" alt=\"rwl_en.png\" /><a\nhref=\"http://canyoneeringusa.com/utah/zion/technical/pine-creek-canyon\">CanyoneeringUSA.com</a>\n: Pine Creek</li>\n<li><img src=\"rwl_en.png\" title=\"rwl_en.png\" alt=\"rwl_en.png\" /><a\nhref=\"http://climb-utah.com/Zion/pinecreek.htm\">Climb-Utah.com</a> :\nPine Creek Canyon</li>\n<li><img src=\"rwl_en.png\" title=\"rwl_en.png\" alt=\"rwl_en.png\" /><a\nhref=\"http://hikearizona.com/decoder.php?ZTN=15645\">HikeArizona.com</a>\n: Pine Creek Canyon</li>\n<li><img src=\"book.png\" title=\"book.png\" alt=\"book.png\" /><a\nhref=\"http://ropewiki.com/User:Zion_Canyoneering_Book?id=Pine_Creek_Canyon\">Zion\nCanyoneering Book by Tom Jones</a> : Pine Creek Canyon</li>\n<li><img src=\"rwl_en.png\" title=\"rwl_en.png\" alt=\"rwl_en.png\" /><a\nhref=\"http://toddshikingguide.com/Hikes/Utah/Zion/Zion7.htm\">ToddsHikingGuide.com</a>\n: Pine Creek Canyon</li>\n<li><img src=\"rwl_en.png\" title=\"rwl_en.png\" alt=\"rwl_en.png\" /><a\nhref=\"http://canyoncollective.com/betabase/pine-creek.58\">CanyonCollective.com</a>\n: Pine Creek</li>\n<li><img src=\"rwl_en.png\" title=\"rwl_en.png\" alt=\"rwl_en.png\" /><a\nhref=\"http://ropewiki.com/User:Super_Amazing_Map?id=Pine_Creek_Canyon_-_Zion_Area\">Super\nAmazing Map</a> : Pine Creek Canyon</li>\n<li><img src=\"rwl_en.png\" title=\"rwl_en.png\" alt=\"rwl_en.png\" /><a\nhref=\"http://americansouthwest.net/slot_canyons/zion_national_park/clear_creek.html\">AmericanSouthwest.net</a>\n: Pine Creek</li>\n<li><img src=\"rwl_en.png\" title=\"rwl_en.png\" alt=\"rwl_en.png\" /><a\nhref=\"http://zioncanyoneering.com/Canyon/Pine-Creek\">ZionCanyoneering.com</a>\n: Pine Creek</li>\n<li><img src=\"rwl_en.png\" title=\"rwl_en.png\" alt=\"rwl_en.png\" /><a\nhref=\"http://summitpost.org/pine-creek-slot/310041\">SummitPost.org</a> :\nPine Creek Slot</li>\n<li><img src=\"rwl_en.png\" title=\"rwl_en.png\" alt=\"rwl_en.png\" /><a\nhref=\"https://wildpathsaz.com/pine-creek-canyon/\">WildPathsAZ.com</a> :\nPine Creek Canyon</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>{{#ev:youtube|rXhRAgCll0s}}</li>\n<li>Video Mystery Canyon, Pine Creek and Keyhole Canyon</li>\n<li>{{#ev:youtube|tv94RdznBAI}}</li>\n<li>{{#ev:youtube|IdqnV0MECTQ}}</li>\n<li><a\nhref=\"https://www.stavislost.com/hikes/trail/pine-creek-canyon\">https://www.stavislost.com/hikes/trail/pine-creek-canyon</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.chasingadventure29.com/pinecreek\">Chasing\nAdventure</a> : May 28th, 2017</li>\n<li><a\nhref=\"http://ultrapinkdirt.wordpress.com/2013/11/11/canyon-pine-creek-zion-national-park/\">Ultra\nPink Dirt</a></li>\n<li><a\nhref=\"http://adamhaydock.blogspot.com/2014/09/keyhole-canyon-and-pine-creek-zion.html\">http://adamhaydock.blogspot.com/2014/09/keyhole-canyon-and-pine-creek-zion.html</a></li>\n<li><img src=\"rwl_en.png\" title=\"rwl_en.png\" alt=\"rwl_en.png\" /><a\nhref=\"http://candition.com/canyons/pine-creek\">Candition.com</a> : Pine\nCreek</li>\n<li><img src=\"rwl_auto.png\" title=\"rwl_auto.png\" alt=\"rwl_auto.png\" /><a\nhref=\"http://wikiloc.com/wikiloc/view.do?id=13703606\">Wikiloc.com</a> :\nPine Creek Canyon - Zion National Park</li>\n<li>Bogley trip report <a\nhref=\"http://www.bogley.com/forum/showthread.php?79595-Pine-Creek-Zion-National-Park-July-28-2019\">http://www.bogley.com/forum/showthread.php?79595-Pine-Creek-Zion-National-Park-July-28-2019</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n",
