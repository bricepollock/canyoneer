  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>A rugged, barely-technical canyon with a scenic approach, a few short\nrappels, and pools which probably hold water year round. Fairly low\ncommitment. A good place to escape the crowds.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>Park at West Fork TH (Call of the Canyon) and pay $11 per vehicle, or\ndrive north about half a mile and look for free parking along the\nshoulder (West Fork overflow parking). There is a trail hugging the\nguard rail from the overflow parking area back to West Fork.</p>\n<p>Note: If entering the West Fork parking area by foot and questioned,\nlet the concessionaire know that you are hiking Thomas Point Trail, not\nWest Fork, and you will not have to pay the $2 per person walk-in\nfee.</p>\n<p>Cross the road and take Thomas Point Trail to the rim. Pick up FR\n9498 and follow it to the turn-off, marked by a cairn. Cross this\ndrainage and hike to the start of Crazy Park, following the KML track\nand keeping to game trails where possible.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p><strong>R1</strong>: 25’ off tree RDC. Shallow pool. Easy to bypass\nwith downclimb LDC</p>\n<p><strong>R2</strong>: 25’ off rock pinch. Waist deep pool. Challenging\nbut possible to bypass with downclimb LDC down ledges or large fallen\ntree.</p>\n<p><strong>R3</strong>: 15’ off boulder, or handline. Easy downclimb\ndepending on conditions.</p>\n<p>A long stretch of boulder-hopping / 2A canyoneering.</p>\n<p>As you near the 4th and final rappel, you will come across a\nchockstone in the watercourse. Downclimb 10’ into a deep pool or bypass\nRDC.</p>\n<p><strong>R4</strong>: 25’ off small tree LDC.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>Follow the drainage to the 89A. Scramble up to the road and walk the\nshoulder on the right (east) side of the road for 0.2 miles, then take\nthe unmarked trail that leaves the road and enters the woods. Early on\nthe trail will fork - stay left in parallel with the road. Follow the\ntrail about 0.5 miles until it merges with Thomas Point Trail and return\nto your vehicle.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<p>$11 per vehicle for West Fork parking. Red Rocks and Interagency\nPasses are not accepted.</p>\n<p>Stay in the drainage during the exit to avoid trespassing on\nprivately owned land, directly south.</p>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n",
