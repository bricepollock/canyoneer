  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>A somewhat high pay-to-play canyon per a long steep approach and a\nlong exit, but your payoff includes a gorgeous narrows, nice rappels,\nfew swims, jumps, and slides go a long way towards making up for it. It\nwould get run all the time if the access was easier.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Watershed: 5.12mi^2.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>Follow the Lewis River trail west about 0.3mi to a bridge crossing\nCussed Creek. Turn right at the junction on the far side and follow the\ntrail upwards (steep!) for ~0.9mi to about ~2400' elevation (approx.\n46.15262, -121.90974). Break off the trail here and traverse/bushwhack\nnorth at about the same elevation for ~0.5mi to a tributary creek. This\ntrib has steep sides in places, but there's an easy game trail crossing\nit at about 46.15974, -121.90920. On the far side, bushwhack up to gain\nthe ridge and follow it east and downwards until you can drop into a\nsmall dell on the north side. Follow the dell east until you reach\nCussed Creek. (Total distance from the trib: ~0.25mi.) The technical\nsection starts just downstream. Total distance: ~2.4mi one-way.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>One can also thrash in via the east side, but it's equally steep and\nlong. The upside to the west approach is being able to gauge the flow\nwhile you’re walking and a trail for a decent stretch of the way.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>Be sure to depth check all slides and jumps. Just because it was a\ngreat jump last year...</p>\n<ul>\n<li>R1/J1: Two stage: 20' rap followed by horizonal pool, then 5' jump\ninto deep pool</li>\n<li>R2/J2: Two stage: 15' rap then 12’ shallow-entry jump into pool</li>\n<li>S1: 8’ slide into deep pool (pretty bumpy, better as a 8-10'\njump)</li>\n<li>S2: <em>The Corkscrew</em> - 10’ curved slide into deep pool</li>\n<li>R3/J3: 45' rap from bolt right, or 10’ rap to ledge then 30’\nshallow-entry jump into 10-12’ deep pool</li>\n</ul>\n<p>0.25 mile very pleasant, grippy creek walk</p>\n<ul>\n<li>S3: nice 10’ slide on left into deep pool (or jump), single bolt\nanchor on right</li>\n<li>A few DCs and a 5' jump</li>\n<li>R4: rap tree L ~30' or sketchy DC</li>\n<li>R5: 70' from tree DCR, twin falls (may be sharp edges)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>0.25 mile pleasant, grippy creek walk</p>\n<ul>\n<li>R6: 30' from tree</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Short creek walk to the bridge you hiked in on. Easy access up on\nleft.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>Follow the trail 0.3 miles back to your car.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<p>Starting in 2021: between June 15 and Sept 30, a permit is required\nto park along a 14mi stretch of FR 90. Parking in this area is limited\nto one of six different recreational sites. Permits are available from\n<a href=\"https://www.recreation.gov/\">recreation.gov</a>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Map of the restricted parking area: <a\nhref=\"https://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/fseprd910851.pdf\"><span>https://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/fseprd910851.pdf</span></a></li>\n<li>The best parking area for Cussed Hollow is Crab Creek.
