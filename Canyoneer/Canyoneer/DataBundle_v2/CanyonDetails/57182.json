Turn right at the junction on the far side and follow the trail upwards (steep!) for ~0.9mi to about ~2400' elevation (approx. 46.15262, -121.90974).  Break off the trail here and traverse\/bushwhack north at about the same elevation for ~0.5mi to a tributary creek.  This trib has steep sides in places, but there's an easy game trail crossing it at about 46.15974, -121.90920.  On the far side, bushwhack up to gain the ridge and follow it east and downwards until you can drop into a small dell on the north side.  Follow the dell east until you reach Cussed Creek.  (Total distance from the trib: ~0.25mi.)  The technical section starts just downstream.  Total distance: ~2.4mi one-way.\n<\/p>\n<ul><li>One can also thrash in via the east side, but it's equally steep and long. The upside to the west approach is being able to gauge the flow while you’re walking and a trail for a decent stretch of the way.<\/li><\/ul>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Be sure to depth check all slides and jumps.
