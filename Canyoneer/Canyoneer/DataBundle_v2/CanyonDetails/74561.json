Permits have a group-size\nlimit that varies depending on the canyon or route. A separate permit is\nrequired for each canyoneering route. Currently, there is no quota limit\nnor permit cost, though that is likely to change at some point in the\nfuture. Permits can be obtained onsite through a self-serve kiosk\nlocated just outside of the visitor center or by sending and email to\ncare_permits@nps.gov using the following format:</p>\n<p><strong>Subject:</strong> Name of canyoneering route and date you\nwill be canyoneering.</p>\n<p><strong>Email Body:</strong> Date of visit (single day only):\nCanyoneering route (single route only): Number of people: Vehicle\nlocation: Number of motorized vehicles: Vehicle description(s):</p>\n<p>If you plan to camp overnight as part of a canyoneering trip, you are\nrequired to obtain a free backcountry permit, available at the visitor\ncenter.</p>\n<h3 id=\"additional_access_information\">Additional Access\nInformation:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>CRNP canyoneering permit information webpage: <a\nhref=\"https://www.nps.gov/care/planyourvisit/canyoneering.htm\">https://www.nps.gov/care/planyourvisit/canyoneering.htm</a></li>\n<li>Other: <a\nhref=\"http://www.americancanyoneers.org/access-capitol-reef/\">http://www.americancanyoneers.org/access-capitol-reef/</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"group_size_limit\">Group-Size Limit:</h3>\n<p>Canyoneering groups are limited to a maximum of 8 people for this\nCanyon.</p>\n<p>Groups larger than 8 or 12 sharing the same affiliation (school,\nchurch, club, scout group, family, friends, etc., or combination\nthereof) may divide into groups smaller than 8 or 12, provided they do\nnot occupy the same canyon, drainage, general area or the same route on\nthe same day.</p>\n<h3 id=\"park_entrance_fee\">Park Entrance Fee:</h3>\n<p>The Scenic drive is the only area of Capitol Reef where an entry fee\nor park pass is required.
