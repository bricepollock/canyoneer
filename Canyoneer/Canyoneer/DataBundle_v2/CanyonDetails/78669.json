{"longitude":-121.6516,"id":78669,"description":"<div class=\"mw-content-ltr mw-parser-output\" lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><p>Hinkle Tinkle is merry, burbling, friendly creek likely named back in the 1950's when you could get away with this sort of thing. The creek drains the eastern side of Butter Peak (on the south end of the Tatoosh Range) just above Packwood, WA. Despite it's laughter-inducing name, Hinkle Tinkle is quite the good little canyon descent with great access. It's an ideal creek for beginners &amp; practice, or when everything else in the neighborhood is flowing just too high to contemplate. It's quite a pretty creek with photogenic falls and colorful bedrock.\n<\/p>\n<ul><li>Hinkle has a watershed of 0.56mi^2 with it's highest point being north of Butter Peak at about 5300ft elevation. We're suspicious that Hinkle is largely snow-fed and may dry up \/ reduce to a trickle in the summer months. It's probably best visited in April and May after the road is open.<\/li><\/ul>\n<ul><li>Note that the creek passes out of the Tatoosh Wilderness at about 2400ft elevation.<\/li><\/ul>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>From the Tatoosh South parking area, follow Trail #161 west for about 1mi. At about 0.7mi, the trail reaches a switchback just above the creek. This is a good place to check the flow before committing to the canyon. If the flow looks good, continue on up one more switchback and drop in the next time the trail nears the creek. A short user trail makes this job easy. You should drop in just adjacent to where a smaller tributary from Butter Peak enters.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>DCR - down canyon right;  DCL - down canyon left.\n<\/p>\n<ul><li>Downclimb 6ft.<\/li>\n<li>R1: 20ft from tree DCL.<\/li>\n<li>R2: 35ft from DCR.<\/li>\n<li>Below R2, downclimb a mini-slot between a boulder and the canyon wall DCR.<\/li>\n<li>R3: 15ft or bypass DCL.<\/li>\n<li>Number of downclimbs.<\/li>\n<li>Long 70ft curving ramp.
