  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>Butterbox (a.k.a. Mt Hay) canyon is a very popular Blue Mountains\nclassic canyon and is a great short day out. It's highlight is the\n\"chockstone\" abseil where you land on a large chockstone wedged between\nthe canyon walls. The common exit features a short 12m EWBANK grade 8\nrock climb requiring lead climbing skills and 5 quickdraws.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Quality</em></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The canyon is rated 6 out of 10 on the Brennan Quality Scale.</li>\n<li>David Noble rates the canyon 4 out of 5 for quality and Medium-Hard\nfor difficulty.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<h3 id=\"by_car\">By car</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Park at Mt Hay carpark at -33.63004,150.40198</li>\n<li>The dirt road to the carpark is easily damaged by rain and use\nrelated wear, and may require an AWD/4WD</li>\n<li>Check <a\nhref=\"https://www.nationalparks.nsw.gov.au/things-to-do/cycling-trails/mount-hay-road-leura\">Mount\nHay Road</a> for closures/current road conditions</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"by_foot\">By foot</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Refer to the <a\nhref=\"https://www.gaiagps.com/map/?loc=14.5/150.3986/-33.6271&amp;pubLink=HCGbHlVN6oI89Bnz34psI0ft&amp;folderId=5899e8eb-16df-426d-ba89-e7190f47af06\">GPX\nvia Gaia GPS</a> (Gaia app not required - allows you to download the GPX\nfile from browser)</li>\n<li>Route and waypoints in the GPX file are approximates only!

On one trip, they forced a pass up Butterbox Point - this may\nhave been the same pass found by Tom Williams on a trip with Bob Sault\nand Dave Noble and others in Dec 77.</p>\n<p>A trip report of the first confirmed ascent of the now standard exit\ncan be viewed here (led by Tom Williams on Christmas Eve 1977): <a\nhref=\"https://www.subw.org.au/archives/press-on-regardless/mt-hay-canyon/\">https://www.subw.org.au/archives/press-on-regardless/mt-hay-canyon/</a></p>\n",
