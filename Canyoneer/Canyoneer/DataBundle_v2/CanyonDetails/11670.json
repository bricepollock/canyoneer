  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>Butterbox (a.k.a. Mt Hay) canyon is a very popular Blue Mountains\nclassic canyon and is a great short day out. It's highlight is the\n\"chockstone\" abseil where you land on a large chockstone wedged between\nthe canyon walls. The common exit features a short 12m EWBANK grade 12\nrock <a\nhref=\"https://www.thecrag.com/en/climbing/australia/blue-mountains/mt-hay/route/13139809\">climb</a>\nrequiring lead climbing skills and 5 quickdraws.</p>\n<h3 id=\"quality\">Quality</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The canyon is rated 6 out of 10 on the Brennan Quality Scale.</li>\n<li>David Noble rates the canyon 4 out of 5 for quality and Medium-Hard\nfor difficulty.</li>\n<li>2 stars (regionally significant) in the French Federation of\nMountain Climbing (FFME) grading system</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"water_levels\">Water levels</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>In typical conditions Butterbox is A2 (FFME grading system)</li>\n<li>The catchment for Butterbox is approximately 5 sq. km</li>\n<li>The canyon features a narrow shoot (P8 in the canyon topo) where all\nwater is funnelled through. This concentrates the water into a powerful\njet. In higher flow conditions (after significant rain) this feature may\nrequire implementing more advanced SRT canyoning techniques to safely\nnavigate e.g. a guided rappel</li>\n<li>A very inaccurate but sometimes relevant \"will I die\" reading can be\ntaken at the <a\nhref=\"https://waterinsights.waternsw.com.au/12964-sydney-drinking-water-catchment/river-data#212291\">Grose\nriver gauge</a> a long way downstream with a ~668 sq. km catchment.\n&gt;400ml/d usually means some heavier rain somewhere in the valley. It\ncan take &gt;12 hours for the gauge to reflect events in Grose's\nheadwaters</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<h3 id=\"by_car\">By car</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Park at Mt Hay carpark at -33.63004,150.40198</li>\n<li>The dirt road to the carpark is easily damaged by rain and use\nrelated wear, and may require an AWD/4WD</li>\n<li>Check <a\nhref=\"https://www.nationalparks.nsw.gov.au/things-to-do/cycling-trails/mount-hay-road-leura\">Mount\nHay Road</a> for closures/current road conditions</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"by_foot\">By foot</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Refer to the <a\nhref=\"https://www.gaiagps.com/map/?loc=14.5/150.3986/-33.6271&amp;pubLink=HCGbHlVN6oI89Bnz34psI0ft&amp;folderId=5899e8eb-16df-426d-ba89-e7190f47af06\">GPX\nvia Gaia GPS</a> (Gaia app not required - allows you to download the GPX\nfile from browser)</li>\n<li>Route and waypoints in the GPX file are approximates only! GPS\ntracking in canyons is notoriously unreliable.</li>\n<li>The entry is a short well worn path</li>\n<li>In the attached canyon topo the canyon starts with the technical\ndown climbs straight after the \"trip intentions log\"</li>\n<li>The entry down climbs may require \"spotting\" of your team members\nand passing packs</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>Proceed down canyon referring to the Butterbox Canyon v4a2III canyon\ntopo for details on problems* you will encounter along the canyon</p>\n<figure>\n<embed src=\"Butterbox_Canyon_v4a2III_.pdf\"\ntitle=\"Butterbox_Canyon_v4a2III_.pdf\" />\n<figcaption>Butterbox_Canyon_v4a2III_.pdf</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p><small>*A \"problem\" is a notable geographical feature that prevents\nyour progression through the canyon. Often engaging with a problem is\nmandatory (e.g. an abseil in a slot canyon where no alternate route\nexists), but occasionally they are optional and can be bypassed via an\nalternate route in the canyon.</small></p>\n<ul>\n<li>P8: some parties report difficult pull-downs when using thinner\nropes if you allow the rope to work itself into the V-groove between the\nwall and chockstone. Test your pull-down prior to the LAPAR on P8.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>The exit is on the canyon right right after the last abseil\n(P13)</li>\n<li>A fairly well worn \"goat track\" should exist.</li>\n<li>Refer to the <a\nhref=\"https://www.gaiagps.com/map/?loc=14.5/150.3986/-33.6271&amp;pubLink=HCGbHlVN6oI89Bnz34psI0ft&amp;folderId=5899e8eb-16df-426d-ba89-e7190f47af06\">GPX\nvia Gaia GPS</a> (Gaia app not required - allows you to download the GPX\nfile from browser)</li>\n<li>The common route includes a rock climbing section that requires lead\nclimbing skills and has 5 fixed hangers and double ring bolt belay at\nthe top</li>\n<li>The ~12m <a\nhref=\"https://www.thecrag.com/en/climbing/australia/blue-mountains/mt-hay/route/13139809\">climb</a>\nis approximately EWBANK grade 12. It is split by a large ledge and quite\nexposed.</li>\n<li>The climb is not your typical \"scramble\" encountered in most Blue\nMountains canyons. Lead climbing skills are a must!</li>\n<li>The non-climbing exit involves following the creek down to the Grose\nRiver, walking upstream on the Grose to the Blue Gum Forest, and then up\nthe Lockley Pylon Track back to the Pinnacles. Rarely done\nnowadays.</li>\n<li>In 2021, a new multi-pitch trad climb (EWBANK grade 19) exit was\nopened, river-right shortly after P8 (chock stone abseil), see <a\nhref=\"https://www.thecrag.com/en/climbing/australia/blue-mountains/mt-hay/route/5413307436\">Buttered\nSide Up</a> .

On one trip, they forced a pass up Butterbox Point - this may\nhave been the same pass found by Tom Williams on a trip with Bob Sault\nand Dave Noble and others in Dec 77.</p>\n<p>A trip report of the first confirmed ascent of the now standard exit\ncan be viewed here (led by Tom Williams on Christmas Eve 1977): <a\nhref=\"https://www.subw.org.au/archives/press-on-regardless/mt-hay-canyon/\">https://www.subw.org.au/archives/press-on-regardless/mt-hay-canyon/</a></p>\n",
