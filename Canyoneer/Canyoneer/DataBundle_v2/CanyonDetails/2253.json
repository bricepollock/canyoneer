May not be a great destination on its own, but perhaps combined with other creeks in the area (ex: Panther Creek or South Santiam River Gorge) for a full day of canyoning.  Likely becomes beginner-friendly in May-June.  Creek is only running a trickle by July.

Follow for ~5mi to large parking area at Green Peter Dam.\n<\/p><p>From the parking area at Green Peter Dam, hike back down the road towards Hwy 20 for perhaps 100 yards.  Look to your right to note the overgrown remnants of an old logging track leading up the hill.  Cross the road and thrash up onto the old track.  It's overgrown with vines at first but follow the track upwards wherever is easiest.  With all the fallen logs and brush eventually it's easier just to go cross-country.  Ascend slopes, then drop into the creek at about 1250ft elevation.\n<\/p>\n<ul><li>It might be easier to walk (or super lazy shuttle) further up Quartzville 0.2mi and take the first left. (?)
