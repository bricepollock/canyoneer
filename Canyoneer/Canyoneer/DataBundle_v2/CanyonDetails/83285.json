We will easily find snow due to its altitude; So at the beginning of the season it can be inaccessible. Given to that open character we can easily evaluate its flow from the track and abandon its descent in almost any part of the tours. Barranco with permanent flow; although no badina covers enough to create movements or allow jumps. The last two rappels are the most committed; Given the reinstatement on a small shelf in which there are maximum 2-3 people and that they descend under waterfall. Due to the extreme conditions suffered by facilities and the type of rock; easily fractable; It should be reviewed and\/or strengthened the facilities before its descent.\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Red_tape\">Red tape<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Unknown regulations.
