  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>Titou Gorge is a long slot canyon with several entries and escapes.\nThere are multiple sections, and names can be confusing.</p>\n<p>This page describes the Titou Gorge (Middle), by far the most\ncommonly run section, which receives guided descents throughout the\nyear.</p>\n<p>This section is often just called Titou, or sometimes Lower Titou,\nwhich is confusing - there is a lower section after this middle section\nwhich is significantly harder!</p>\n<p>This canyon was renamed in December 2022 following an agreement\nbetween American canyoneer Lukas Eddy and local French canyoneer\nNathalie, who lives and guides in Dominica. It may be years until the\npublic and the government call it Middle Titou.</p>\n<p>Names aside, Titou Gorge (Middle) is a fantastic five-star canyon.\nRarely on Earth is there a five-star canyon will a five-minute approach,\na ten-minute exit, and excellent anchors throughout - as well as\ndependable flow!</p>\n<p>For newbies and expert canyoneers alike, this one is not to be\nmissed. This is THE first canyon that any canyoneer must do on\nDominica.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>The approach is incredibly short and simple. From the parking area,\ncross the ford, where the concrete road goes across the river.</p>\n<p>Once across the river, immediately on the right (heading down-canyon)\nis a faint path in the bushes. Follow this path for barely a minute,\nwhen it opens up into the stream.</p>\n<p>Clamber down the boulders of the stream for about a minute before\narriving at the first rappel.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>The entire slot has around 7-8 rappels, depending on what you jump.\nThere are literally hundreds of bolts throughout the canyon, placed by\ndifferent guiding agencies, and replaced, or abandoned, after\nhurricanes. The largest rappel is no more than 15 meters, but it's best\nto plan for 20 meter rappels, in case bolts get moved in the future.</p>\n<p>The slot is completely committing, with no escape or opportunity to\nget to higher ground. Avoid rains at all costs!</p>\n<p>Rappel One has several options. Do not jump from the top. From a\nmidpoint pedestal, jumping may be possible. Scout first.</p>\n<p>Rappel Two is easily jumped.</p>\n<p>Some walking and scrambling through boulders brings you to Rappel\nThree. This small rappel can usually be jumped.</p>\n<p>Rappel 4 is a choice between a traverse on the left to a mess of\nbolts and a rappel around 12 meters, or following the watercourse down a\nhandline to a hanging pool and an 8-meter waterfall. In high water, take\nthe traverse.</p>\n<p>After R4 is a slide-like feature which can be jumped from the\nleft.</p>\n<p>Next is a traverse line on the left leading to the tiny R5. Please\nleave the coiled ropes here as they are.</p>\n<p>Rappel Six is off a huge mess of bolts on the right. There is a\ntraverse line past the obvious bolts out to a ledge, from where you can\njump or rappel around 7 meters.</p>\n<p>Rappel Seven is often jumped, although the jump is off a slippery\nrock in a fairly narrow hallway. There are bolts on the left to rappel\nand scout the jump.</p>\n<p>Rappel 8 is the final rappel, off a bunch of bolts on the left.\nYou'll go down right next to the waterfall.</p>\n<p>Just downstream of R8 is the obvious exit on down-canyon-right.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>The exit is simple. Not long after the last rappel, on the right is a\nconfluence with a waterfall. This is the first, and only, time that the\ncanyon opens up a little. On the right, there are obvious rebar steps\nand a red rope here. Climb up the rebar steps to exit.</p>\n<p>Don't miss the rebar steps, or you'll be entering Titou Gorge (Lower)\na difficult and fully committing route.</p>\n<p>Atop the rebar steps, follow the well-travelled trail up the stream,\nwhich then goes through a few small meadows. Only 10-15 minutes after\nleaving the slot, you'll emerge on the road. Turn right and walk less\nthan 100 meters to your vehicle.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<p>No red tape.</p>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<p>Caution!</p>\n<p>Beta sites describe Titou Gorge (Middle) and Titou Gorge (Lower) as\none canyon. They're two canyons in the same drainage.</p>\n<p><a\nhref=\"https://www.descente-canyon.com/canyoning/canyon/21686/Titou-gorge-inferieur.html\">https://www.descente-canyon.com/canyoning/canyon/21686/Titou-gorge-inferieur.html</a></p>\n<p><a\nhref=\"https://ankanionla-madinina.com/titou-gorge-inf/\">https://ankanionla-madinina.com/titou-gorge-inf/</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<p><a\nhref=\"https://www.lukaseddy.com/dominica\">https://www.lukaseddy.com/dominica</a></p>\n<p>{{#ev:youtube|Gftjj2bQvE4}}</p>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n<p>This canyon probably saw its first descent in the 1990's by French\ncanyoneers. Today, it's descended by thousands of tourists per year,\nmany from cruise ships. At least two guiding agencies on Dominica\noperate in this canyon.</p>\n<p>There have never been any major accidents in this canyon. That said,\nsomeday there will be a major accident on Dominica, and the government\nwill restrict or even close canyons. Be safe.</p>\n",
