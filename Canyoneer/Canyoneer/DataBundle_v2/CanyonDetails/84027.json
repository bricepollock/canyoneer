  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>A short side entrance canyon of Mystery Springs Canyon in the Sierra\nAncha Mountains. It's not a destination canyon but rather a\nbeginner-friendly one for someone who has a capable 4x4 and 2 hours to\nkill after doing Parker Canyon. Similar to Phog Canyon but with more\nprickly pear cactus and a less friendly exit.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>An easy 15-minute walk across a couple of hills and a barbed wire\nfence. The first drainage you cross is Mystery Springs Canyon proper\nwhich has just one rappel of about 100 ft. It could be fun with some\nflow.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>Once in the drainage, rappel 1 is 20 feet on canyon left from webbing\naround a horn. There is minor bushwhacking to rappel 2 which is 10 feet\ndown a narrow hallway. The anchor is webbing around a small bush and\nrock. Rappel 3 is 70 feet from webbing off a tree on canyon right.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>After the third rappel, the exit is on canyon right up an obvious\nslope across from the waterfall. Make your way up and right around the\nmanzanita, catclaw, and many prickly pear working the slope on the left\nside of the rock fall</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n",
