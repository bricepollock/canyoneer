The waterfall is usually dry, but it was first descended in class B conditions during a rainstorm.  The approach and exit are a pretty grueling bushwhack, making the waterfall a much needed reward.\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Follow the Brooks Creek Trail up to the waterfall viewing point, from which you’ll be able to gauge the flow.  At many times, these falls are completely dry; the first descent was after a series of heavy rains and we saw 3 falls. Continue up the trail until you hit the road, turn left and continue up the road 0.5 miles before dropping into the drainage on the left around (37.56479, -122.48567).  At the time of writing, there is no trail leading down the drainage, and the bushwhacking intensifies from walking through shrubs to crawling down the creek to a few brief Class 3 scrambles.  In flowing conditions, the creek will become wet a short horizontal distance before the first rappel.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Some pre-placed webbing, but don’t expect it.

All of the vertical section is through razorgrass, thorny vines, and on unstable ground.  It’s not fun.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Red_tape\">Red tape<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Brooks Falls is within the park boundaries, there are no known park regulations that discourage canyoneering in the area. \n<\/p><p>Parking is available in San Pedro Valley State Park for $6 and limited hours. Note that the gate closes before sunset and park rangers take notice and fine cars left behind the gate after the parking lot closes.
