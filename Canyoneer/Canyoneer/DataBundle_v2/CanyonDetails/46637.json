The last waterfall is the most impressive drop touting at 270' foot rappel. It is visible from I-84.  This drainage is not a big one and the flow largely dries up by early to mid-summer.\n<\/p><p>While rappelling is not illegal in Crown Point State Park, the park manager has closed access to the areas below the Vista House due to safety concerns\/accidents from other \"extreme sports.\" The exit towards Mirror Lake also involves crossing the RR tracks (private property).\n<\/p><p>Please consider these restrictions prior to running this canyon.\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Park at the Vista House.

(Be aware that this is an active freight line and trains come barreling through here with little-to-no warning.  Walking on the tracks is also trespassing, so make your crossing short &amp; sweet.  This is not a good place to linger or go for a walk.)  Follow along the south side of I-84 toward Rooster Rock State Park.  There is a parking area directly off the exit ramp (eastbound I-84) providing access to a boat ramp on Mirror Lake.  If the gate to the boat ramp is closed, you can park on the shoulder.  You do not need to enter the park proper or pay a fee.<\/li><\/ul>\n<ul><li>The same track at the west end of Mirror Lake can be followed south.  While not shown on the map, it climbs and switchbacks up to eventually meet the parking area at the <i>Women's Forum<\/i> viewpoint at Chanticleer Point.  This is another option for a shuttle.  (Use extreme caution if hiking the Historic Columbia River Hwy back to the Vista House as there is little to no shoulder.)  Route gains about 800ft elevation.<\/li><\/ul>\n<ul><li>If you're an experience bushwhacker, make your way west along the base of the cliffs, circle around the great formation of Alpenjager and grovel your way up a steep dirty gully (full of trash thrown down from above over the years) back to the west side of the Vista House.
