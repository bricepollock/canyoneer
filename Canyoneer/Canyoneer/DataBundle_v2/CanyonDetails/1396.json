{"description":"<div class=\"mw-content-ltr mw-parser-output\" lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><p>There are 2 portions to this canyoneering adventure in Malibu Creek. First there's the canyon with a few pretty nice drops and beautiful views into Malibu Creek and even the ocean (at the drop-in). Then at the exit there's Rindge Dam, a massive structure built in the 1920s, currently in a state of decay. Some bushwhacking higher up in the canyon but not too bad. There doesn't seem to be too many canyoneering opportunities available in the Santa Monica Mountains but this is worth the trip.\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>From the parking area, looking down into Malibu Creek, the canyon is below you. It is a bit steep to drop-in directly from here but there is a use trail on one end of the parking area heading North West along the ridge. Follow this use trail down into the canyon. There may be multiple use trails but pay attention so you switchback into the canyon.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Rappel 1: 80ft from the anchor from a stout bush DCR.\n<\/p><p>After a 10ft down-climb the canyon narrows a bit and you arrive at the top of the main rappel\n<\/p><p>Rappel 2: 130ft bush DCR. This bush is a little exposed so the person rigging will probably want to be on belay.\n<\/p><p>Rappel 3: 45ft from tree anchor DCR.\n<\/p><p>Rappel 4: 90ft from bush DCL. Pretty nice rappel with a little free hang at the start.  If using a retrievable anchor, be extra careful of rope pull issues.\n<\/p><p>Rappel 5. 30ft. Cairn anchor, center canyon. There are also some bushes DCL you could use.\n<\/p><p>Shortly after the last rappel you will come to the junction with Malibu Creek.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<p><span style=\"color:red\">This exit is currently CLOSED.<\/span>  See  for details.\n<\/p><p>Turn right and boulder hop upstream in Malibu Creek eventually coming to Rindge Dam and the large swimming hole below it. If it's a weekend and it's a warm day, chances are there will be quite a few people here jumping off the dam and hanging out. Sadly this area is quite trashed.\n<\/p><p>The path out is DCL around the dam (to your right looking up at it). It's a steep use trail climbing around to the top of the dam. Then you have to climb down some old rebar ladders in the concrete, cross the water flow and climb up another ladder on the other side. Be very careful here in high water! If it's not safe you might search upstream for a better way to cross. There are a few use trails heading back up to the road.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Red_tape\">Red tape<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>It appears that parking is not allowed for quite a ways on Malibu Creek Road\/Las Virgenes before and after the indicated parking area on the kml. We parked off the road trying to get out of view and didn't get a ticket. Park here at your own risk.\n<\/p><p>It appears you can park at the intersection of Piuma Rd. and Malibu Creek Rd.\/Las Virgenes. This however is quite a walk.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Beta_sites\">Beta sites<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Trip_reports_and_media\">Trip
