Download the GPX format for map and waypoints for this routes, but be advised that GPS is limited in accuracy due to the many towering fins and walls.  Your GPS may not accurately represent your location in the Fiery Furnace.  This area is a maze connected by tight slot canyons, arches, and rock towers. You can book a ticket for the ranger guided tour (reservations needed well in advance) or you can also go on your own (hiking permit required from the Visitor Centre). To go in on your own you must be proficient at scrambling, route finding and tracking, as this is a REAL maze and it can be easy to get lost or trapped in some dead end passage, especially because many GPS receivers do not function nearly as well with interference from the tall walls.  <b>Take extra care<\/b> to avoid become lost or otherwise needing a rescue; see Red Tape below for more information.\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>The Fiery Furnace trailhead is well marked.

Look for footprints, rock discoloration and other disturbances to follow the route the rangers usually do. If you find yourself cliffed out look around and think. Sometimes is not obvious but there is a bypass that has only minor exposure. Before you do some major exposed traverses or downclimbs, make absolutely sure you can come back if need be.

The park offers either a Ranger-led tour, or self-guided options.  Either option does require an advanced reservation made through Recreation.gov (see details below).  For both the ranger-led tours and the self-guided permits, each person in your group must go through an orientation at the visitors center (hours vary by season) in order to enter the Fiery Furnace.  The orientation consists of an 8 minute orientation and safety video followed by a 5 minute ranger talk before you can pay for your self-guided permit or go on the tour.  Reservations and permits are issued up to 7 days in advance and often sell out. \n<\/p><p>Ranger-led tours must be booked with an advanced reservation through Recreation.gov.  Tours are $16 per person.

And, increasing numbers of rescues may cause park rangers to close access to canyoneers or others.  Be sure to put extra preparation and care into route planning and route finding, and have a backup plan in the fairly likely event that your GPS loses reception.  If you use rope to descend at any point, make absolutely sure you are confident in your location before pulling the rope as failing to do so is likely to lead to a rescue.  This is bad for the canyoneering community and is difficult for SAR teams, and the rescue is unlikely to be prompt.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Beta_sites\">Beta sites<\/h2><\/div>\n<ul><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external free\" href=\"http:\/\/www.gjhikes.com\/2011\/06\/arches-np-fiery-furnace.html\">http:\/\/www.gjhikes.com\/2011\/06\/arches-np-fiery-furnace.html<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http:\/\/roadtripryan.com\/go\/t\/utah\/moab\/fiery-furnace\">RoadTripRyan.com<\/a> &#160;: Fiery Furnace<\/li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http:\/\/climb-utah.com\/Moab\/furnace.htm\">Climb-Utah.com<\/a> &#160;: Fiery<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n<\/div><div class=\"mw-content-ltr mw-parser-output\" lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><pre>Furnace - Arches National Park\n<\/pre>\n<ul><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http:\/\/ropewiki.com\/User:Super_Amazing_Map?id=Fiery_Furnace_-_Moab_Area\">Super Amazing Map<\/a> &#160;: Fiery Furnace<\/li><\/ul>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Background\">Background<\/h2><\/div>\n\n\n<\/div>","url":"https:\/\/ropewiki.com\/Fiery_Furnace","technicalRating":2,"riskRating":null,"name":"Fiery Furnace","months":["Dec","Jan","Feb","Mar","Apr","May","Sep","Oct","Nov","Jun","Jul","Aug"],"timeRating":"II","rappelCountMin":0,"shuttleSeconds":null,"id":950,"longitude":-109.5609,"permit":"Yes","version":"4bfbb55331fedeb53af0f82e4a50b167e8c971f3285e0d060946a704e1605f5d","rappelLongestMeters":null,"quality":4,"waterRating":"A","rappelCountMax":0}
