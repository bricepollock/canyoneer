It sounds\nlike the trailhead will be permanently pushed back one mile from its\nprevious location to reduce impacts on the Kachess River.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Details: <a\nhref=\"https://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/okawen/news-events/?cid=FSEPRD1112265\">https://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/okawen/news-events/?cid=FSEPRD1112265</a>'''</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<p>Mineral Creek is a gem of a canyon (pun intended!). This route has\nstunning turquoise pools, jumps, orange colored rock, and an easy\napproach and exit. If you look closely, you may see an old mineshaft or\nveins of pyrite (fool's gold) in the rock!</p>\n<p>This route is half-equipped, it’s been bolted for for high-water\nconditions for flow avoidance. Bolt stations for rappelling in the flow\nhave not been installed. If you like small jumps and slides it’s a great\nlittle water park. If you like rappelling in the flow you will need to\nbring a drill as natural anchor options for wet rappelling are not\navailable.</p>\n<p>Mineral is a higher flow canyon in early season compared to many in\nthe vicinity, but water levels drop quickly in the late summer. It\nshares a trailhead with Incognito and the two can be combined with\nnearby <a href=\"Incognito_Canyon\" title=\"wikilink\"><strong>Incognito\nCanyon</strong></a> for a full weekend (an efficient team can do both in\none day, typically starting with Incognito first and Mineral second, due\nto the logistics of the hiking trails).</p>\n<p><strong>Sensitive species impact mitigation:</strong> Mineral Creek\nis a critical resource for a struggling population of <a\nhref=\"https://wdfw.wa.gov/species-habitats/species/salvelinus-confluentus#locations\">Bull\nTrout</a>. Bull Trout [<a\nhref=\"https://digital.lib.washington.edu/researchworks/bitstream/handle/1773/17072/Bull%20Trout.pdf?sequence=1#\">https://digital.lib.washington.edu/researchworks/bitstream/handle/1773/17072/Bull%20Trout.pdf?sequence=1#</a>:~:text=Bull%20trout%20spawn%20in%20the,spaces%20of%20larger%20rocks%20below.\nspawn in the fall], peaking in October-November, requiring up to 220\ndays of undisturbed gravel residence before emerging. To provide\nadequate buffer, it's best to travel through Mineral between July\n15-Sept 15 when the creek would not be host to Bull Trout redds.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p><strong>Getting to the Trailhead</strong> Take I-90 west to exit 80\nand follow Bullfrog Road through the small town of Roslyn\n(alternatively, take exit 84 to Cle Elum if coming from the east).\nFollow SR-903 (which soon becomes Salmon La Sac road) north out of\nRoslyn for a little over 14 miles. Turn left onto Forest Road 46 and\ncross the Salmon La Sac River. Drive 9.4 miles over Cooper Pass to the\nMineral Creek Trailhead. No recreation passes are required at the\ntrailhead. There are also no toilets available.</p>\n<p><strong>Getting to the Canyon</strong> Follow the trail from the\nparking area. Cross the Kachess River close to the point you first meet\nit, using an upstream log secured with metal cables. From the log the\ntrail continues up the hillside about 1/3rd of a mile until you reach\nthe T junction between the Mineral Creek Trail and the Little Kachess\nTrail. Turn right and hike for 1.2 miles until the trail intersects with\nMineral Creek.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p><strong>SUMMARY</strong></p>\n<p><em>DCR = Down Canyon Right</em></p>\n<p><em>DCL = Down Canyon Left</em></p>\n<p>Mineral Creek features jumps and slides - be sure to check depth for\neach of them. <strong>The pools are seductively beautiful but can be\nquite shallow!</strong></p>\n<p>Commitment Factor: Moderate. The upper canyon has many potential,\nthough steep, exit options. Once into the lower section, escape options\nare limited.</p>\n<p>Compared to the upper section, the lower sections obstacles come in\nquick succession. From some spots it's possible to look back and see\nyour last three rappels all in the same view.</p>\n<p><strong>Upper Section</strong></p>\n<p>The upper section has many water park features, all on small drops:\ndownclimb, slide, jump, slide, slide, jump, downclimb and some beautiful\nand easy creek walking and wading on generally grippy rock. There are no\nmandatory rappels. There is also an old mine adit DCR above the slide.\nIt is approximately 0.6 miles from the drop-in to the lower section.</p>\n<p><strong>Lower Section</strong></p>\n<p>It is possible to drop in early and run just the lower section of the\ncanyon, but the hillside is quite steep and brushy. Expect a rappel into\nthe creek.</p>\n<p><strong>R1</strong>: DCL - 50' wet rappel from bolts. A 15’ downclimb\non super grippy rock then a 15’ low angle slide. Or a low-angle rap into\na deep pool below large overhanging cliff face. This drop can be\nidentified by the large log spanning the canyon. Webbing for DCL anchor\noption to rappel in the flow, rigged off live alder roots.</p>\n<p><strong>J1</strong>: 12' from center canyon, or down-climb DCL.</p>\n<p><strong>R2</strong>: DCR -dry rappel 50' from a bolt station next to\na small alcove in the rock. NEEDS BOLTS DCL to be on the flow.</p>\n<p><strong>J2</strong>: 5’ downclimb or 5' technical jump into a short,\nnarrow V corridor that turns abruptly DCR. The walls of the corridor\nslope inward, creating a narrow gap to jump, so checking this jump is\nhighly recommended.</p>\n<p><strong>R3</strong>: DCL - 60' from a a bolt station. This rappel is\nknown as 'the Washing Machine' as the water circles around in a shallow,\nslippery bowl mid-rappel. This lower pool has been jumped from the\nmidpoint ledge, but it is quite shallow (about 6').</p>\n<p><strong>R4</strong>: DCR - 40' from a small tree.</p>\n<p><strong>R5</strong>: DCR - 40' traverse line over a logjam to a 50'\ndry rappel. Both the traverse line and the anchor station are bolted.\nWhen picking your specific rap line here watch for rope-eating cracks.\nNEEDS BOLTS DCL to rap in the flow.</p>\n<p><strong>R6</strong>: DCR - 20' dry rappel from a bolt station, use\nrope protection for abrasion . Jumping is possible here from multiple\nspots, but caution must be taken to clear a ledge below and to avoid\nlogs on the left. NEEDS BOLTS DCL to rappel in the flow.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>Follow the creek for a short distance until you reach a large\nlog-jam. This can be bypassed on DCR.</p>\n<p>Keep an eye out for blue flagging-tape left by the Department of Fish\n&amp; Wildlife.</p>\n<p>About 100 yards beyond the log-jam, exit up the bank DCR wherever is\neasiest. In 2021 there was some blue tape marking the exit point.</p>\n<p>Parallel the creek downstream (along what used to be the NF-4600\nroad, but now overgrown) until you reach the log you used earlier to\ncross the river.</p>\n<p>Walk back to the cars. Beer, song, and general merriment should\nensue.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<p><a\nhref=\"https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.2910147279111756&amp;type=3\">FB\nphoto album from first descent</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n<p>This canyon was first descended on July 26, 2020 by Jake Huddleston,\nKevin Steffa, Ryan Ernst, Barry Specht, Haruka Lipscomb, and Tiffanie\nLin.
