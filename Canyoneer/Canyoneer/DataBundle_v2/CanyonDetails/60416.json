Follow SR-903 (which soon becomes Salmon La Sac road) north out of Roslyn for a little over 14 miles.  Turn left onto Forest Road 46 and cross the Salmon La Sac River.  Drive 9.4 miles over Cooper Pass to the Mineral Creek Trailhead. No recreation passes are required at the trailhead. There are also no toilets available. \n<\/p><p><b>Getting to the Canyon<\/b>\nFollow the trail from the parking area. Cross the Kachess River close to the point you first meet it, using an upstream log secured with metal cables. From the log the trail continues up the hillside about 1\/3rd of a mile until you reach the T junction between the Mineral Creek Trail and the Little Kachess Trail. Turn right and hike for 1.2 miles until the trail intersects with Mineral Creek.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p><b>SUMMARY<\/b>\n<\/p><p><i>DCR = Down Canyon Right<\/i>\n<\/p><p><i>DCL = Down Canyon Left<\/i>\n<\/p><p>Mineral Creek features jumps and slides - be sure to check depth for each of them. <b>The pools are seductively beautiful but can be quite shallow!<\/b>\n<\/p><p>Commitment Factor: Moderate.

There are multiple old mines along the creek. It is approximately 0.6 miles from the drop-in to the lower section.
