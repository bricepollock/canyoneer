Creek likely can pack a punch during the spring run-off, but flow diminishes substantially heading into summer and eventually dries up.  Nice location for a little practice - particularly in combination with <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http:\/\/ropewiki.com\/Eightmile_Creek\">Eightmile Creek<\/a> down the road.\n<\/p><p>Creek is located close to Horsethief Butte - a popular area to train for rock climbing (and rappelling).\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Take I-84 to exit 87 at The Dalles.  Turn left off the exit and cross the bridge north over the Columbia River.  Head north about 3.5mi to a T-jct and turn right onto Hwy 14.  Follow Hwy 14 for 1.9mi to a large unsigned pullout on the south side of the highway.  There is room for several vehicles.\n<\/p><p>From the pullout walk carefully east along the shoulder of Hwy 14 for about 0.1mi.  On the far east side, look down to note the culvert where Fivemile Creek passes underneath Hwy 14 and empties into a concrete flume which channels the creek south for a hundred feet or so before dumping into a small hidden canyon.  Downclimb a loose rocky slope DCL of the flume and follow a small path to the top of R1.  (Dropping directly into the flume looks fun, but might be slippery \/ dangerous with any flow.)\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>R1 comes immediately at the south end of the flume.\n<\/p>\n<ul><li>R1: 25ft down a rocky chute into a punchbowl.  May be a swimmer \/ possible hydraulic in higher water.  Anchored off small bush DCL.  Can downclimb the chute directly if dry.<\/li>\n<li>R2: 12ft.  Anchored from a rock horn DCL.  Can be bypassed DCR.<\/li><\/ul>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>At the bottom, continue down the drainage, avoiding a large thicket of poison oak, to reach the bottom of the local valley.  Exit the drainage DCR and gradually head westward on a rising traverse.  Make your way upwards wherever is easiest to return to your car.  Beware loose rock as the slope is somewhat steep in places.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Red_tape\">Red tape<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>None.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Beta_sites\">Beta sites<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media<\/h2><\/div>\n<p><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http:\/\/parks.state.wa.us\/489\/Columbia-Hills\">Columbia Hills State Park<\/a>\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Background\">Background<\/h2><\/div>\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nParsed by mw‐api‐ext.codfw.main‐6779cc57fc‐rcgq6\nCached time: 20240914192007\nCache expiry: 2592000\nReduced expiry: false\nComplications: [show‐toc]\nCPU time usage: 0.006 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.007 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 21\/1000000\nPost‐expand include size: 0\/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 0\/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 2\/100\nExpensive parser function count: 0\/500\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0\/20\nUnstrip post‐expand size: 0\/5000000 bytes\nNumber of Wikibase entities loaded: 0\/400\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%    0.000      1 -total\n-->\n<\/div>","technicalRating":3,"permit":"No","riskRating":null,"id":48312,"url":"https:\/\/ropewiki.com\/Fivemile_Creek","timeRating":"I","longitude":-121.1155,"geojson":{"type":"FeatureCollection","features":[{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"coordinates":[[-121.11779272556305,45.64844900722168,0],[-121.11742794513702,45.648520258019225,0],[-121.11696124076843,45.6486065088634,0],[-121.11660718917847,45.64869275957476,0],[-121.11625850200653,45.64879776026153,0],[-121.11596345901489,45.648884010678394,0],[-121.1154967546463,45.64902651107618,0]],"type":"LineString"},"properties":{"name":"Approach"}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"name":"Descent"},"geometry":{"coordinates":[[-121.11549139022827,45.649022761070334,0],[-121.1153894662857,45.648887760693505,0],[-121.11534655094147,45.64877901015334,0],[-121.11531972885132,45.648666509372326,0],[-121.11534655094147,45.64851275793954,0],[-121.1153519153595,45.64837025623473,0],[-121.11534655094147,45.648272754859406,0],[-121.11537873744965,45.64817150325156,0],[-121.115443110466,45.648040250894894,0],[-121.11547529697418,45.64790149806917,0]],"type":"LineString"}},{"properties":{"name":"Exit"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"LineString","coordinates":[[-121.11553966999054,45.64789024782499,0],[-121.11577570438385,45.64784899691034,0],[-121.11657500267029,45.64789024782499,0],[-121.11710608005524,45.64795024910117,0],[-121.11738502979279,45.64799900009072,0],[-121.11756205558777,45.64806275132074,0],[-121.11766934394836,45.64815650299779,0],[-121.11772835254669,45.648317755515265,0],[-121.11776053905487,45.64838900647975,0]]}},{"properties":{"name":"Parking"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"coordinates":[[-121.11781418323517,45.648437757087464,0]],"type":"Point"}},{"geometry":{"coordinates":[[-121.11532982076568,45.648609959508555,0]],"type":"Point"},"type":"Feature","properties":{"name":"R1"}}]},"version":"0955c16b8603881790fa8cdbba87a9565896c5006161782e0d3f83ef8da13a20"}
