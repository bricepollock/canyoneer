There are two primary objectives here:\n<\/p><p>1) Lower Dog Creek (3C III) - This page describes the recommended route and visits the best part of the canyon, doing an out &amp; back from the bottom. This approach requires teams to be comfortable with some class 3-4 scrambling and\/or setting safety lines for protection.\n<\/p><p>2) Upper Dog Creek (3C IV) - A full descent of Dog starting from the radio towers atop Cook Hill. This option is long and strenuous and takes most of a day. The upper drainage is wild, overgrown, seldom-visited, and rugged. This route is described on a <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https:\/\/ropewiki.com\/Upper_Dog_Creek\">separate page<\/a>.\n<\/p><p>A number of other approaches to Dog have all been tried and none of them are good.\n<\/p>\n<ul><li>The Meditation Pool sequence in the lower canyon can be extremely dangerous in high flow.<\/li>\n<li>The checkpoint is the last waterfall on Dog Creek which is about a 1min walk from the exit parking area.<\/li>\n<li>Water Catchment: 3.75mi^2.<\/li><\/ul>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>The recommended route on Dog Creek is to do an out &amp; back from the bottom.  Hike up the creek bypassing all of the falls, then turn around whenever you like for a technical descent. Groups commonly turn around above the Meditation Pool sequence (R1). Pro: This approach allows all the falls to be scouted in advance. Con: Your team needs to be comfortable scrambling on, sometimes loose, class 3-4 terrain and route-finding. Consider setting up one or more safety lines for your team.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Hazards\">Hazards<\/h2><\/div>\n<ul><li>Poison oak. It's everywhere.  You'll undoubtedly encounter it on slopes away from the water.<\/li>\n<li>Wildlife. Bears, yellowjackets and rattlesnakes have all been encountered in the lower creek.<\/li>\n<li>Tourists. The lower falls are frequently visited by non-canyoner hikers in late summer. You may encounter them climbing up and down Class 4 terrain with no ropes, no helmets, and wearing flipflops. It's a scary sight.<\/li><\/ul>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Note that the bypass descriptions are from the POV of going downstream.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading3\"><h3 id=\"The_Meditation_Pool\">The Meditation Pool<\/h3><\/div>\n<p>Most canyon teams will come up the canyon from below, bypassing all of the falls, and turn around here to start their descent.\n<\/p><p>The creek narrows up and plunges over two drops into a deep pool. This section of narrows can be dangerous in high water. A hydraulic and strong current may be present. Historically, the Meditation Pool has been rather abused by day hikers.  Please remove any fixed ropes or other installations you find here. There's still some hardware and other junk affixed to the canyon walls.  Ropes are unnecessary to play in the pool or bypass this falls.\n<\/p>\n<ul><li><b>R1a:<\/b> 10ft from single bolt DCL.<\/li>\n<li><b>R1b:<\/b> 30ft of vertical height down a chute into the Meditation Pool. Rappel required: approximately 50ft from bolt station DCL per the horizontal distance. At the bottom of the chute, look carefully DCR (rappeller's left) to spot a narrow ledge just out of the flow and above the pool. This is a good place to set the length.  <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=6cX8p9WKi6U&amp;feature=youtube\">[1]<\/a> Video of the bottom of his rappel in high flow. This rappel is the signature photo of this page.<\/li><\/ul>\n<p>Bypass: From the top of the falls, backtrack up-canyon 100ft, then thrash out DCL. There's an animal trail if you can find it. Head up through the poison oak and traverse the rim, until you find a place to rappel back in downstream of the falls. Alternately, downclimb a dirty gulley (class 3-4).\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading3\"><h3 id=\"Lower_Narrows\">Lower Narrows<\/h3><\/div>\n<p>Below R1 the drops come in quick succession.\n<\/p>\n<ul><li><b>R2:<\/b> 20ft.

Bypass: Circle around the rock formation DCR and downclimb (class 3-4) to the top of R8. There is another old dubious bolt at the top this downclimb.<\/li>\n<li><b>R8:<\/b> <i>Dog Creek Falls<\/i>: 60ft from an unlinked bolt station atop a boulder DCL. Location of the anchor allows you to rappel in or out of the flow depending on preference. Visitors may be present in the pool below, so beware throwing your rope.  Bypass: Go 20ft DCR along the edge and downclimb (class 4).  A small tree marks the top of the downclimb.  Using this tree for an anchor is not recommended as it has a rotten core.<\/li><\/ul>\n<style data-mw-deduplicate=\"TemplateStyles:r1062633282\">@media all and (max-width:720px){.mw-parser-output .content .thumb>div:not(.thumbinner){display:flex;justify-content:center;flex-wrap:wrap;align-content:flex-start;flex-direction:column}}body.skin-vector .mw-parser-output div.thumb>div:not(.thumbinner){font-size:94%;text-align:center;overflow:hidden;min-width:100px}body.skin-minerva .mw-parser-output div.thumb>div:not(.thumbinner){margin:0 auto;max-width:100%!important}<\/style> \n<div class=\"thumb tright\">\n<div style=\"display:table;\">\n<span class=\"mw-default-size\" typeof=\"mw:Error mw:File\/Frameless\">\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<link rel=\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\" href=\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1062633282\"> \n<div class=\"thumb tright\">\n<div style=\"display:table;\">\n<span class=\"mw-default-size\" typeof=\"mw:Error mw:File\/Frameless\">\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<link rel=\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\" href=\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1062633282\"> \n<div class=\"thumb tright\">\n<div style=\"display:table;\">\n<span class=\"mw-default-size\" typeof=\"mw:Error mw:File\/Frameless\">\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Walk back to your car at the trailhead.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Red_tape\">Red tape<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>None.
