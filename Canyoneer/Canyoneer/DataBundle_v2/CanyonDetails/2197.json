  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>Dog Creek is is another nice canyon destination in the Columbia\nGorge. There are two primary objectives here:</p>\n<p>1) Lower Dog Creek (3C III) - This page describes the recommended\nroute and visits the best part of the canyon, doing an out &amp; back\nfrom the bottom. This approach requires teams to be comfortable with\nsome class 3-4 scrambling and/or setting safety lines for\nprotection.</p>\n<p>2) Upper Dog Creek (3C IV) - A full descent of Dog starting from the\nradio towers atop Cook Hill. This option is long and strenuous and takes\nmost of a day. The upper drainage is wild, overgrown, seldom-visited,\nand rugged. This route is described on a <a\nhref=\"https://ropewiki.com/Upper_Dog_Creek\">separate page</a>.</p>\n<p>A number of other approaches to Dog have all been tried and none of\nthem are good.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Meditation Pool sequence in the lower canyon can be extremely\ndangerous in high flow.</li>\n<li>The checkpoint is the last waterfall on Dog Creek which is about a\n1min walk from the exit parking area.</li>\n<li>Water Catchment: 3.75mi^2.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>The recommended route on Dog Creek is to do an out &amp; back from\nthe bottom. Hike up the creek bypassing all of the falls, then turn\naround whenever you like for a technical descent. Groups commonly turn\naround above the Meditation Pool sequence (R1). Pro: This approach\nallows all the falls to be scouted in advance. Con: Your team needs to\nbe comfortable scrambling on, sometimes loose, class 3-4 terrain and\nroute-finding. Consider setting up one or more safety lines for your\nteam.</p>\n<h2 id=\"hazards\">Hazards</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Poison oak. It's everywhere. You'll undoubtedly encounter it on\nslopes away from the water.</li>\n<li>Wildlife. Bears, yellowjackets and rattlesnakes have all been\nencountered in the lower creek.</li>\n<li>Tourists. The lower falls are frequently visited by non-canyoner\nhikers in late summer. You may encounter them climbing up and down Class\n4 terrain with no ropes, no helmets, and wearing flipflops. It's a scary\nsight.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<h3 id=\"the_meditation_pool\">The Meditation Pool</h3>\n<p>Most canyon teams will come up the canyon from below, bypassing all\nof the falls, and turn around here to start their descent.</p>\n<p>The creek narrows up and plunges over two drops into a deep pool.\nThis section of narrows can be dangerous in high water. A hydraulic and\nstrong current may be present. Historically, the Meditation Pool has\nbeen rather abused by day hikers. Please remove any fixed ropes or other\ninstallations you find here. There's still some hardware and other junk\naffixed to the canyon walls. Ropes are unnecessary to play in the pool\nor bypass this falls.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>R1a:</strong> 10ft from single bolt DCL.</li>\n<li><strong>R1b:</strong> 30ft of vertical height down a chute into the\nMeditation Pool. Rappel required: approximately 50ft from bolt station\nDCL per the horizontal distance. At the bottom of the chute, look\ncarefully DCR (rappeller's left) to spot a narrow ledge just out of the\nflow and above the pool. This is a good place to set the length. <a\nhref=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cX8p9WKi6U&amp;feature=youtube\">1</a>\nVideo of the bottom of his rappel in high flow.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Bypass: From the top of the falls, backtrack up-canyon 100ft, then\nthrash out DCL. There's an animal trail if you can find it. Head up\nthrough the poison oak and traverse the rim, until you find a place to\nrappel back in downstream of the falls. Alternately, downclimb a dirty\ngulley (class 3-4).</p>\n<h3 id=\"lower_narrows\">Lower Narrows</h3>\n<p>Below R1 the drops come in quick succession.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>R2:</strong> 20ft. Bypass: downclimb a gully DCL.</li>\n<li><strong>R3:</strong> 20ft. Bypass: downclimb slippery slope\nDCR.</li>\n<li><strong>R4:</strong> 20ft. Bypass on trail DCL. There are a couple\nmanky bolts in the DCL wall which can be used for a handline if\nneeded.</li>\n<li><strong>R5:</strong> <em>Fan Falls</em>: 25ft. Bypass on a trail\nstarting DCL near the top of R4.</li>\n<li><strong>R6:</strong> 50ft from single bolt in the canyon wall DCR.\nBypass: dirty trail DCL.</li>\n<li>15ft two-tier jumbly drop. Usually skipped. Bypass on dirty trail\nDCL.</li>\n<li><strong>R7:</strong> 35ft. Beware a pinch DCR side of the falls\nwhere a rope can get stuck. Bypass: Circle around the rock formation DCR\nand downclimb (class 3-4) to the top of R8. There is another old dubious\nbolt at the top this downclimb.</li>\n<li><strong>R8:</strong> <em>Dog Creek Falls</em>: 60ft from an unlinked\nbolt station atop a boulder DCL. Location of the anchor allows you to\nrappel in or out of the flow depending on preference. Visitors may be\npresent in the pool below, so beware throwing your rope. Bypass: Go 20ft\nDCR along the edge and downclimb (class 4). A small tree marks the top\nof the downclimb. Using this tree for an anchor is not recommended as it\nhas a rotten core.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>Walk back to your car at the trailhead.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<p>None. Please help keep the canyon clean and remove any trash or fixed\nropes you might find. Thanks!</p>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><img src=\"rwl_en.png\" title=\"rwl_en.png\" alt=\"rwl_en.png\" /><a\nhref=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20210527212206/www.canyoneeringnorthwest.com/DogCreek/Dog_Creek.php\">CanyoneeringNorthwest.com\n(archive.org)</a> : Dog Creek</li>\n<li><img src=\"rwl_en.png\" title=\"rwl_en.png\" alt=\"rwl_en.png\" /><a\nhref=\"http://hikearizona.com/decoder.php?ZTN=19482\">HikeArizona.com</a>\n: Dog Creek Falls</li>\n<li><img src=\"rwl_en.png\" title=\"rwl_en.png\" alt=\"rwl_en.png\" /><a\nhref=\"http://ropewiki.com/User:Super_Amazing_Map?id=Dog_Creek_-_Washington\">Super\nAmazing Map</a> : Dog Creek</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Quadcopter flying over Dog Creek narrows {{#ev:youtube|<a\nhref=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGb6D59SHko\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGb6D59SHko</a>}}</li>\n</ul>\n<p>{{#ev:vimeo|128194436}}</p>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n<p>Dog Creek has seen human visitation going back many years.
