  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>Not a major objective, but Curly Creek Falls is one of the most\nunique waterfalls in Washington State. Per the Northwest Waterfall\nSurvey: \"<em>Having two arches spanning the falls places Curly Creek\namong a globally exclusive list; there may be only a handful of\nwaterfalls on the entire planet able to make that claim.</em>\" It's\nsuspected that the geology of this area is the result of the creek\ncutting through a lava tunnel. This waterfall is something of a tourist\nattraction - with a viewpoint located high up on the embankment on the\nnorth side of the Lewis River. The creek runs high in the early season,\nbut dries up completely (or goes entirely underground?) somewhere in\nJuly / August.</p>\n<p>Curly is probably best to run when there's some water, but not too\nmuch.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>In high flow: rappelling the falls directly could be dangerous. With\nthe pothole full, the lower arch becomes a <strong>siphon</strong>.</li>\n<li>When dry, the falls presents a rather unusual feature in the Pacific\nNW: a <strong>keeper pothole</strong> at the bottom of R1.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Also: consider the height of the Lewis River before running this\nfalls. In higher flow it may be difficult to cross or follow the\nsouthern bank. See \"Exit\" below.</p>\n<h2 id=\"directions\">Directions</h2>\n<h3 id=\"lower_trailhead\">Lower Trailhead</h3>\n<p>From the junction of FR-90 (Lewis River Road) and Curly Creek Rd\nfollow FR-90 east for 0.9mi. Take a sharp left onto FR-9039 and drive\ndown the hill 0.6mi to a parking area on the left before the bridge.</p>\n<h3 id=\"checkpoint_1_lewis_river\">Checkpoint #1: Lewis River</h3>\n<p>Walk out onto the bridge to check the Lewis River. The river height\nmay be important as you'll likely need cross it or follow the south\nshore to get back to the lower parking area.</p>\n<h3 id=\"checkpoint_2_curly_creek\">Checkpoint #2: Curly Creek</h3>\n<p>From the lower parking area, drive across the bridge and up the hill\nfor 0.4mi. Turn off left into the parking area for Curly Creek. Walk in\non a short trail, turning right at the junction, to an obvious viewpoint\nof the falls. The view isn't great, but it's the best checkpoint for\nwater height on the creek.</p>\n<h3 id=\"upper_trailhead\">Upper Trailhead</h3>\n<p>Shuttle or walk the road back up to FR-90. Turn right and continue\nwest past Curly Creek Rd for 0.2mi and take the first right on an\nunmarked dirt road leading to a dispersed campsite. Park at first\nopportunity in pullout on the left.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>From the old campground, bushwhack northwesterly and downhill until\nyou intersect Curly Creek. Drop down into the creek wherever is easiest\nand make your way downstream to the top of the falls. Just before the\nfalls the creek passes through some interesting areas of water-carved\nbasalt. Expect a minor downclimb or three. Distance to the top of the\nfalls is about 0.25mi and takes about 10min. Do not eat any of the\npoisonous mushrooms along the way.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>Use caution as Curley Creek is a very unusual drop. Imagine the first\npitch as rappelling into a vertical silo with two holes punched out in\nthe side part way down.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>R1: 50ft. We anchored off a tree just above the creekbed DCR.\nConsider extending the powerpoint for a cleaner pull from below. Do NOT\nrappel all the way to the bottom of this pitch as it will deposit you in\nthe bottom of the silo in a <strong>keeper pothole</strong>. Instead,\nexit the rappel onto a not-that-wide ledge that leads to a short\ndownclimb to a larger ledge just below both arches. There is room for\n2-3 people here. Use caution when traversing the ledge as it can be\nslick. Confirm there are sufficient natural features present for the R2\nanchor BEFORE pulling your rope down. In September 2018 there were\nseveral options for anchors.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>R2: 65ft. From the ledge, we climbed down into a narrow person-sized\ntunnel just DCR and under the lower natural arch - and anchored off a\nlarge log firmly wedged in place among the rocks. (In high flow, this\ntunnel would be full of fast-moving water.) It is likely that this\nanchor will need to be replaced every year after the winter floods. We\nrappelled right out the mouth of the tunnel; it was quite easy to get on\nrappel. The rappel goes into a deep calm pool which is freezing COLD.\nThe pool looks deceptively shallow from above, but it's a swimmer. In\nSeptember, the pool at the bottom of the falls was far colder than the\nLewis River nearby. While Curly Creek appears dry in late season it's\nlikely that the creek goes underground and emerges via several springs\nat/near the foot of the falls. We found one small actively-flowing\nspring nearby.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"other_notes\">Other Notes</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The keeper at the bottom of the silo is about 8-10ft deep and has no\nexit that a human could pass through. If you should rappel in, getting\nout might require ascending a rope, a partner assist (maybe two\npartners), and/or spending an inordinate amount of time &amp; energy\nmoving rocks and piling them up high enough to escape. The bottom of the\nsilo is likely full of water when the creek is running at any\nstrength.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>It might be possible to rappel over the top of the uppermost arch\nand down, but the rope pull likely would be difficult... and it's likely\nnowhere near as fun. This might be the way to go in high water\nconditions, however. (Instead of trying to retrieve the rope from below,\nit might be better to tie the rope off, rappel - and just hike back to\nthe top of the falls after to get your rope.)</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Given the tourist viewpoint across the river, please use natural\ncolored webbing or black. Waterfall photographers do not appreciate\nbright red slings atop the drop. If possible, try to build your anchors\nso they are not in direct line of sight with the viewpoint (easy).</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>In late summer, water on the Lewis River is lower and you can follow\nthe south bank all the way back to your car (~0.4mi). Even in low water\nconditions there are short stints of swimming and you may need to hop\ninto the water briefly and pull yourself along a rocky wall. Expect a\nlittle wading, scrambling, some boulder hopping, talus slopes, and rocky\nslopes. Closer to the bridge, you can follow fishing trails along the\nbank which makes for easy travel. Just before the bridge, look for a\nmuddy trail on your right that leads steeply upwards back into the lower\nparking area.</p>\n<p>In high water it might be possible to exit up a steep rocky ramp\nright at the foot of Curly Creek Falls and exit atop the cliff, but we\ndid not explore that direction. (If feasible, this might enable an out\n&amp; back from the upper trailhead.) Another possibility might be to\ncross the Lewis River and exit to the Lewis River Trail higher up the\nembankment on the north side. Reportedly waterfall photographers use\nthis route to access the falls.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<p>None.</p>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<p><a\nhref=\"https://www.waterfallsnorthwest.com/waterfall/Curly-Creek-Falls-5276\">NW\nWaterfall Survey</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n<p>Falls was first run by Kevin Clark and Lisa Ripps in September\n2018.</p>\n",
