Per the Northwest Waterfall Survey:  \"<i>Having two arches spanning the falls places Curly Creek among a globally exclusive list; there may be only a handful of waterfalls on the entire planet able to make that claim.<\/i>\"  It's suspected that the geology of this area is the result of the creek cutting through a lava tunnel.  This waterfall is something of a tourist attraction - with a viewpoint located high up on the embankment on the north side of the Lewis River.  The creek runs high in the early season, but dries up completely (or goes entirely underground?) somewhere in July \/ August.\n<\/p><p>Curly is probably best to run when there's some water, but not too much.\n<\/p>\n<ul><li>In high flow:  rappelling the falls directly could be dangerous.  With the pothole full, the lower arch becomes a <b>siphon<\/b>.<\/li>\n<li>When dry, the falls presents a rather unusual feature in the Pacific NW:  a <b>keeper pothole<\/b> at the bottom of R1.<\/li><\/ul>\n<p>Also:  consider the height of the Lewis River before running this falls.  In higher flow it may be difficult to cross or follow the southern bank.  See \"Exit\" below.\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Directions\">Directions<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading3\"><h3 id=\"Lower_Trailhead\">Lower Trailhead<\/h3><\/div>\n<p>From the junction of FR-90 (Lewis River Road) and Curly Creek Rd follow FR-90 east for 0.9mi.

Turn off left into the parking area for Curly Creek.  Walk in on a short trail, turning right at the junction, to an obvious viewpoint of the falls.  The view isn't great, but it's the best checkpoint for water height on the creek.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading3\"><h3 id=\"Upper_Trailhead\">Upper Trailhead<\/h3><\/div>\n<p>Shuttle or walk the road back up to FR-90.  Turn right and continue west past Curly Creek Rd for 0.2mi and take the first right on an unmarked dirt road leading to a dispersed campsite.  Park at first opportunity in pullout on the left.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>From the old campground, bushwhack northwesterly and downhill until you intersect Curly Creek.  Drop down into the creek wherever is easiest and make your way downstream to the top of the falls.  Just before the falls the creek passes through some interesting areas of water-carved basalt.  Expect a minor downclimb or three.  Distance to the top of the falls is about 0.25mi and takes about 10min.  Do not eat any of the poisonous mushrooms along the way.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Use caution as Curley Creek is a very unusual drop.  Imagine the first pitch as rappelling into a vertical silo with two holes punched out in the side part way down.\n<\/p>\n<ul><li>R1:  50ft.  We anchored off a tree just above the creekbed DCR.  Consider extending the powerpoint for a cleaner pull from below.  Do NOT rappel all the way to the bottom of this pitch as it will deposit you in the bottom of the silo in a <b>keeper pothole<\/b>.  Instead, exit the rappel onto a not-that-wide ledge that leads to a short downclimb to a larger ledge just below both arches.  There is room for 2-3 people here.   Use caution when traversing the ledge as it can be slick.  Confirm there are sufficient natural features present for the R2 anchor BEFORE pulling your rope down.  In September 2018 there were several options for anchors.<\/li><\/ul>\n<ul><li>R2:  65ft.  From the ledge, we climbed down into a narrow person-sized tunnel just DCR and under the lower natural arch - and anchored off a large log firmly wedged in place among the rocks.  (In high flow, this tunnel would be full of fast-moving water.)  It is likely that this anchor will need to be replaced every year after the winter floods.  We rappelled right out the mouth of the tunnel; it was quite easy to get on rappel.  The rappel goes into a deep calm pool which is freezing COLD.  The pool looks deceptively shallow from above, but it's a swimmer.  In September, the pool at the bottom of the falls was far colder than the Lewis River nearby.  While Curly Creek appears dry in late season it's likely that the creek goes underground and emerges via several springs at\/near the foot of the falls.  We found one small actively-flowing spring nearby.<\/li><\/ul>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading3\"><h3 id=\"Other_Notes\">Other Notes<\/h3><\/div>\n<ul><li>The keeper at the bottom of the silo is about 8-10ft deep and has no exit that a human could pass through.  If you should rappel in, getting out might require ascending a rope, a partner assist (maybe two partners), and\/or spending an inordinate amount of time &amp; energy moving rocks and piling them up high enough to escape.  The bottom of the silo is likely full of water when the creek is running at any strength.<\/li><\/ul>\n<style data-mw-deduplicate=\"TemplateStyles:r1062633282\">@media all and (max-width:720px){.mw-parser-output .content .thumb>div:not(.thumbinner){display:flex;justify-content:center;flex-wrap:wrap;align-content:flex-start;flex-direction:column}}body.skin-vector .mw-parser-output div.thumb>div:not(.thumbinner){font-size:94%;text-align:center;overflow:hidden;min-width:100px}body.skin-minerva .mw-parser-output div.thumb>div:not(.thumbinner){margin:0 auto;max-width:100%!important}<\/style> \n<div class=\"thumb tright\">\n<div style=\"display:table;\">\n<span class=\"mw-default-size\" typeof=\"mw:Error mw:File\/Frameless\">\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<link rel=\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\" href=\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1062633282\"> \n<div class=\"thumb tright\">\n<div style=\"display:table;\">\n<span class=\"mw-default-size\" typeof=\"mw:Error mw:File\/Frameless\">\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>{{pi\n<\/p>\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nParsed by mw‐api‐ext.codfw.main‐6779cc57fc‐m2hmp\nCached time: 20240914192121\nCache expiry: 2592000\nReduced expiry: false\nComplications: [show‐toc]\nCPU time usage: 0.035 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.043 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 206\/1000000\nPost‐expand include size: 1420\/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 111\/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 8\/100\nExpensive parser function count: 0\/500\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0\/20\nUnstrip post‐expand size: 1058\/5000000 bytes\nLua time usage: 0.003\/10.000 seconds\nLua memory usage: 635189\/52428800 bytes\nNumber of Wikibase entities loaded: 0\/400\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%   30.550      1 -total\n 99.74%   30.470      2 Template:Pic\n 50.65%   15.473      2 Template:Str_number\/trim\n-->\n<\/div><div class=\"mw-content-ltr mw-parser-output\" lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><p>c|archOut.jpg ~ Looking out from the lower arch tunnel.

Even in low water conditions there are short stints of swimming and you may need to hop into the water briefly and pull yourself along a rocky wall.  Expect a little wading, scrambling, some boulder hopping, talus slopes, and rocky slopes.  Closer to the bridge, you can follow fishing trails along the bank which makes for easy travel.  Just before the bridge, look for a muddy trail on your right that leads steeply upwards back into the lower parking area.\n<\/p><p>In high water it might be possible to exit up a steep rocky ramp right at the foot of Curly Creek Falls and exit atop the cliff, but we did not explore that direction.  (If feasible, this might enable an out &amp; back from the upper trailhead.)  Another possibility might be to cross the Lewis River and exit to the Lewis River Trail higher up the embankment on the north side.  Reportedly waterfall photographers use this route to access the falls.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Red_tape\">Red tape<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>None.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Beta_sites\">Beta sites<\/h2><\/div>\n<p><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https:\/\/www.waterfallsnorthwest.com\/waterfall\/Curly-Creek-Falls-5276\">NW Waterfall Survey<\/a>\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Background\">Background<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Falls was first run by Kevin Clark and Lisa Ripps in September 2018.\n<\/p>\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nParsed by mw‐api‐ext.codfw.main‐6779cc57fc‐jlh8x\nCached time: 20240914192122\nCache expiry: 2592000\nReduced expiry: false\nComplications: [show‐toc]\nCPU time usage: 0.005 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.006 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 15\/1000000\nPost‐expand include size: 0\/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 0\/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 2\/100\nExpensive parser function count: 0\/500\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0\/20\nUnstrip post‐expand size: 0\/5000000 bytes\nNumber of Wikibase entities loaded: 0\/400\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%    0.000      1 -total\n-->\n<\/div>","waterRating":"C","shuttleSeconds":null,"rappelCountMin":1,"latitude":46.0587,"vehicle":"Passenger","geojson":{"type":"FeatureCollection","features":[{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"coordinates":[[-121.96940396232088,46.056054034524394,0],[-121.97000477714022,46.0566198760815,0],[-121.97073433799227,46.057155931155656,0],[-121.97129223746737,46.057394176184935,0],[-121.97185013694246,46.05784088284427,0],[-121.97232220572909,46.05816846543102,0],[-121.97266552848299,46.05849604607437,0],[-121.97288010520418,46.05879384497285,0]],"type":"LineString"},"properties":{"name":"Approach"}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"name":"Exit"},"geometry":{"coordinates":[[-121.9730088512369,46.05934476870087,0],[-121.97193596763094,46.059553224894245,0],[-121.97094891471346,46.05940432769356,0],[-121.97026226920565,46.05940432769356,0],[-121.96970436973055,46.05952344548623,0],[-121.96910355491121,46.059880797322336,0],[-121.9686314861246,46.06020836780705,0],[-121.96798775596102,46.06059549405619,0],[-121.96742985648592,46.06098261759097,0],[-121.96682904166659,46.06145907359995,0],[-121.96648571891268,46.061846191079745,0]],"type":"LineString"}},{"properties":{"name":"Shuttle"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"LineString","coordinates":[[-121.9654986659952,46.062099304887376,0],[-121.96545186448861,46.06202297380338,0],[-121.96521999999999,46.06203,0],[-121.96437000000003,46.06218,0],[-121.95911000000001,46.06328,0],[-121.95850999999999,46.06337,0],[-121.95299999999997,46.06366,0],[-121.95299999999997,46.06366,0],[-121.95461,46.06207,0],[-121.95515,46.06165,0],[-121.95591000000002,46.06123,0],[-121.95679000000001,46.06093,0],[-121.96107999999998,46.06029,0],[-121.96174000000002,46.06015,0],[-121.96204,46.06003,0],[-121.96222,46.05984,0],[-121.96231999999998,46.05968,0],[-121.96233000000001,46.05941,0],[-121.96215999999998,46.05868,0],[-121.96217999999999,46.0584,0],[-121.96231,46.05817,0],[-121.96247,46.05799,0],[-121.96247,46.05799,0],[-121.96293000000003,46.05758,0],[-121.96325999999999,46.05739,0],[-121.96620000000001,46.05628,0],[-121.96620000000001,46.05628,0],[-121.96823999999998,46.05558,0],[-121.96866478075691,46.0553888486594,0],[-121.96906063956698,46.0558753465123,0]]}},{"properties":{"name":"Checkpoint 1"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"coordinates":[[-121.9665,46.062,0]],"type":"Point"}},{"geometry":{"coordinates":[[-121.97360000000003,46.0598,0]],"type":"Point"},"type":"Feature","properties":{"name":"Checkpoint 2"}},{"properties":{"name":"Curly Creek Falls"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[[-121.97300000000001,46.059,0]]}},{"geometry":{"coordinates":[[-121.9658,46.0621,0]],"type":"Point"},"properties":{"name":"Lower Trailhead"},"type":"Feature"},{"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[[-121.96949999999998,46.0558,0]]},"properties":{"name":"Upper Trailhead"},"type":"Feature"}]}}
