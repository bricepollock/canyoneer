  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>This is pretty section of narrows with quite a bit of water, but is\nnon-technical and only yields a handful of slides in the canyon. The\nprimary reason for posting is to make sure no one else wastes their time\nhiking up there to explore the canyon if they are looking for a\ntechnical canyon.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>Drive to Three Forks TH west of the seasonal town of Platoro, CO.\nFrom Platoro drive west/north on County Road 250 for 5 miles then left\nonto Forest Road 247 for 5 miles and park at the end of Fdr-247.\nStarting elevation is 10,200 feet. Follow the Conejos River Trail past a\nsign for South San Juan Forest for about 2 miles to a sign for Three\nForks, stay straight on Trail #712 for about 1/4 mile to a fork; take\nthe right fork (north) Trail #714. The trail will switchback steeply\nthrough the forest for about a half mile. Once the trail flattens and\nyou can start to glimpse the river, leave the trail to start your\ndescent.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>Several slides leading into chest deep boils.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>Once the watercourse flattens out and before the confluence with the\nMain Fork Conejos River, exit left to find the trail you came in on.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<p>First descent 9/5/15 Kelton Manzanares, Logan DeGrand, and Stephanie\nMinnaert <a\nhref=\"https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.1470292059966128&amp;type=1&amp;l=63ccba4d4f\">https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.1470292059966128&amp;type=1&amp;l=63ccba4d4f</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n",
