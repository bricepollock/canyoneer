  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>Popular gorge walking site used by numerous centres across the whole\nof the North of England. Can get extremely (!) busy during the Summers.\nRecent (2016) damage to trails during Summer seasons may jeopardise\nfuture access.</p>\n<p>Gorge itself is short and easy, but very scenic.</p>\n<p>One 10m rappel to start (Ashgill Force). Anchor bolts are messy, and\nseem to have been placed without much of a plan. There are over 6 bolts\n- some must be around or over 15 years old now ('ownership' of these\nbolts is actually a source of contention between local outdoor\nproviders).</p>\n<p>After the rappel, follow the stream for 2 jumps and a short slide.\nAsh Gill then joins the South Tyne, which is a good high water kayak\ngorge run.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><img src=\"rwl_en.png\" title=\"rwl_en.png\" alt=\"rwl_en.png\" /><a\nhref=\"http://canyonguides.org/guide-book/canyon-locations-map?id=Ash_Gill\">UK\nCanyonGuides.org</a> : Ash Gill</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n",
