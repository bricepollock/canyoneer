class=\"mw-content-ltr mw-parser-output\" lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><p>Seven Teacups, often abbreviated 7TC, is a short section of Dry Meadow Creek just before it joins the Kern River and is one of the best Class C canyons in California. This canyon is best descended in summer or fall, or whenever the flow is not extremely high as there are flow-related challenges.  The technical descent is relatively short and, because the terrain is relatively forgiving with short jumps and multiple escape points, this canyon makes for a perfect practice ground before attempting longer and more difficult Class C Sierra canyons. But note that once you get into teacup2 and pull the rope, it is extremely difficult to escape the watercourse until after some of the most challenging features in the canyon: the approach to, and descent of, the corkscrew waterfall. In higher flow, safe descent usually requires advanced swiftwater techniques.\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading3\"><h3 id=\"Current_conditions\">Current conditions<\/h3><\/div>\n<p>When judging flow, remember that trip reports are subjective and often influenced by the skill level of their authors. Actual gauge measurements are good indications, but 7TC itself is not gauged so the other gauges may not accurately reflect the flow level in 7TC. Ultimately, every canyoneer is individually responsible for making the decision to enter a canyon and should not assume the beta they read (including on this page) will accurately reflect the conditions they will actually encounter in the canyon.\n<a href=\"\/w\/index.php?title=Template:DisplayConditions&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Template:DisplayConditions (page does not exist)\">Template:DisplayConditions<\/a>\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading3\"><h3 id=\"References\">References<\/h3><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>There are multiple approaches to Seven Teacups.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading3\"><h3 id=\"Brennen\">Brennen<\/h3><\/div>\n<p>Described by Chris Brennen, this route starts at the Jeep trail at 35.9766°, -118.4996° and follows a sometimes-faint trail with full sun exposure 1.83 miles to the first water of Dry Meadow Creek.  It can be difficult to navigate, so a GPS is recommended.  After the initial 300ft of elevation gain on a 13% grade, the remainder of the route is slightly down hill with a few ups and downs as one navigates along the dry gully.  This approach has the least amount of hiking, but most sections of it are cross country which can be quite hard if there has not been any forest fire in a while.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading3\"><h3 id=\"Full_loop\">Full loop<\/h3><\/div>\n<p>For canyoneers without access to two cars to make the shuttle, the road from Johnsondale Bridge to the start of the Brennen approach adds 1.4 miles and 500ft of elevation gain for a total approach of 3.3 miles and 800ft of elevation gain. This has the worst of both worlds and is definitely not recommended.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading3\"><h3 id=\"Bottom-up\">Bottom-up<\/h3><\/div>\n<p>The easier and most popular approach is bottoms up. Instead of the Brennen route which circles around the hills on the west side of the Kern, Seven Teacups can also be approached by reversing the exit route to the confluence of Dry Meadow Creek with the Kern, going slightly farther upstream and crossing the Kern (be careful of Respect, a class IV  rapid a short distance downstream of the Dry Meadow Creek confluence), then climbing steeply (34% grade) 300ft up the west bank of the Kern around the Seven Teacups section on its north side.  This bypass route is shown in orange on the map and enters Dry Meadow Creek shortly before the Seven Teacups section, bypassing 0.18 miles of creek travel in Dry Meadow Creek relative to the Brennen approach.  This approach is 2.55 miles long and has slightly over 500ft of elevation gain.\n<\/p><p>When the flow of the Kern is strong, setting a rope across the river may aid in crossing it.  Again, be careful of the class IV  rapid just downstream of the Dry Meadow Creek confluence.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading4\"><h4 id=\"3rd_Class_Variation\">3rd Class Variation<\/h4><\/div>\n<p>A slight variation to the Bottom-up approach is to climb the knobby face directly to the north of the canyon.  Amazing knobs and good friction makes this steep face an extremely pleasant climb for those that are equipped with good shoes and are comfortable with some exposure.  Once on the top of the face, continue past some bushes and trees to a (comparatively) featureless slab.  Climb the shallow gulley on the left (4th Class), or trend right and climb the obvious right facing dihedral (3rd Class) to the top.  From here, you can traverse left back to the water course, dropping in wherever you desire.  \n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading3\"><h3 id=\"4WD\">4WD<\/h3><\/div>\n<p>For those that have a 4WD vehicle, it may be possible to bypass crossing the Kern river completely. There is <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https:\/\/tinyurl.com\/gkvhnox\">a gate at the start of the 2WD route<\/a> marked on the map that is sometimes closed. When it is open, this might be the only option to run 7 Teacups when the Kern is flowing 3000cfs or higher. Usually it is possible to reach the Dry Meadow Primitive Campground area with a passenger vehicle, but high clearance 4WD (or hiking) is required for the rest of the approach. The last mile is especially rough.  The gate is probably open between Memorial Day and Labor Day.  Outside of that range, it is typically closed.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Walk, wade, swim and rappel down the water course. Jumps and slides are often appropriate, but always have one person check the depth first and that there are no hidden rock ledges.

The serious consequences of being trapped on rope under the waterfall can be mitigated by using a contingency anchor (such as a <a href=\"\/w\/index.php?title=Figure_8_block&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Figure 8 block (page does not exist)\">Figure 8 block<\/a>) and manning the station from the top being ready to cut the rope in case of emergency.<\/li>\n<li>Guided rappels will be difficult here due to lack of downstream anchors.<\/li>\n<li>Some spots in the pool are over the head while others are just knee deep, and they change seasonally, so always send a person down to check for depth before anyone jumps.<\/li>\n<li>Once in teacup 4, the RDC edge of the pool may be difficult to escape but it is possible to exit by carefully climbing out the edge of the next waterfall (at the end of a short corridor with two small potholes).<\/li>\n<li>Historically, some chose to climb up on canyon left to the LDC lip of teacup4 (inaccessible from teacup3) to do an optional 20'  jump into teacup4. As of August 2019 the water is deep enough for this to be safe, but <b>always<\/b> check the depth before anyone jumps.<\/li><\/ul><\/li>\n<li><b>Teacup5<\/b>, <b>Teacup6<\/b> and <b>Teacup7<\/b>: These teacups can be down climbed on canyon right that, albeit quite steep, is not too hard.  There is a single bolt DCR (installed summer 2019) that can be used to get down the steep slab.  They can also be jumped by climbing the edge of each waterfall and pushing off from the edge. Waterfalls tend to accumulate rocks and debris under the whitewater areas but are usually deepest in the center of the pool. Approach the edge of a waterfall only if determined to jump, as hesitating at the edge may cause you to slip and fall on rocky ledges with severe consequences.<\/li>\n<li><b>Tall Rappel<\/b> (labeled <b>1st big rappel<\/b> in Satellite view): ~60' rappel rigged off of double bolt anchor on LDC, behind 3 trees.  Here, the waterfall comes in from the right, into a small pothole and a pinch point with a boulder, known as the Washing Machine. In high flows, this feature could cause difficulties, in which case it can be bypassed by traversing high on canyon left and down climbing down the slabs on LDC.<\/li>\n<li><b>Nuisance Rappel<\/b>: 15' Nuisance rappel off of single bolt.<\/li>\n<li><b>Left Turn<\/b>: Here, the canyon will turn 90 degrees to the left after a big waterfall. This waterfall can be bypassed by down climbing a series of ledges on canyon left, but is more fun to rappel by using two bolts hidden inside a dry small pothole 50' at the top of the drop. This will produce a dry rappel if staying canyon left or wet if staying on canyon right. The wet rappel can be dangerous in moderate to high levels water, so make sure you gauge the water level appropriately before you commit to the wet rappel - anchor has been removed. Wet or dry, you will land in a large pool with a long swim.

From an anchor on canyon right, rappel as far right as possible along the walls of the canyon until you find a metal chain with a hook anchored in one small pothole along the wall. This will provide a redirection point to safely land into the narrow slot below. If you don't use this redirection you will have to negotiate your way through a very narrow slot with multiple hazardous hydraulics that cannot be seen until one is over the edge. If doing the canyon with novices, it is best to station someone at the pothole with the hook to assist people going through the redirection.\n<ul><li>More experienced canyoneers can bypass this rappel by climbing up a class 2 slab LDC, dropping into the dry gully, and swimming the pothole (not suggested in anything higher then moderate conditions) to a short 15' stem.

Some of them can be booked in advance, some are first come first served. Some of them are private and relatively expensive but have incredibly nice facilities, some of them are US Forest and moderately equipped, some of them are free and have nothing more than a porta potty. Please be aware that ALL campgrounds in the area get completely full for memorial day and major weekends in June, with mariachi fiestas up to 3am and beyond in most camps. If you are looking for a quiet camp, try getting as far away possible from the main campgrounds, especially the ones near the lake or river, and choose the secluded primitive locations.\n<\/p><p><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https:\/\/www.fs.usda.gov\/Internet\/FSE_DOCUMENTS\/fseprd1031274.pdf\">FS Order 0513-22-05<\/a> explicitly prohibits camping around the Johnsondale Bridge. \n<\/p><p>For US Forest campgrounds:\n<\/p>\n<ul><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external free\" href=\"http:\/\/www.dbw.ca.gov\/Pubs\/KernRiver\/KernMap.pdf\">http:\/\/www.dbw.ca.gov\/Pubs\/KernRiver\/KernMap.pdf<\/a> Map or Kern River US Forest Campgrounds<\/li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external free\" href=\"http:\/\/www.kernvalley.com\/news\/kerncmp.htm\">http:\/\/www.kernvalley.com\/news\/kerncmp.htm<\/a> Upper Kern US Forest Campgrounds<\/li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external free\" href=\"https:\/\/www.fs.usda.gov\/recarea\/sequoia\/recreation\/recarea\/?recid=79571\">http:\/\/www.fs.usda.gov\/recarea\/sequoia\/recreation\/recarea\/?recid=79571<\/a> Kern River US Forest Information<\/li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external free\" href=\"https:\/\/www.fs.usda.gov\/Internet\/FSE_DOCUMENTS\/stelprd3801985.pdf\">http:\/\/www.fs.usda.gov\/Internet\/FSE_DOCUMENTS\/stelprd3801985.pdf<\/a> US Forest Visitor Guide<\/li><\/ul>\n<p>For private campgrounds and motels, search for lodging near \"Kernville, CA\" on:\n<\/p>\n<ul><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external free\" href=\"https:\/\/yelp.com\">http:\/\/yelp.com<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external free\" href=\"http:\/\/tripadvisor.com\">http:\/\/tripadvisor.com<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external free\" href=\"http:\/\/www.gotokernville.com\">http:\/\/www.gotokernville.com<\/a><\/li><\/ul>\n<p>There are also campgrounds in the Forks of the Kern area, the area n\n<\/p>\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nParsed by mw‐api‐ext.codfw.main‐6779cc57fc‐59b4k\nCached time: 20240914192119\nCache expiry: 2592000\nReduced expiry: false\nComplications: []\nCPU time usage: 0.009 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.013 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 13\/1000000\nPost‐expand include size: 18\/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 0\/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 2\/100\nExpensive parser function count: 0\/500\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0\/20\nUnstrip post‐expand size: 0\/5000000 bytes\nNumber of Wikibase entities loaded: 0\/400\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%    1.327      1 Template:Pics\n100.00%    1.327      1 -total\n-->\n<\/div><div class=\"mw-content-ltr mw-parser-output\" lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><p>orth of the Johnsondale bridge.

It's first come first served and completely free. This camp is overlooked by the party goers because away from the river and lack of shade and scorned by families because lack of picnic tables and developed bathrooms. One might be able to find a spot in Chico Flat even late on Friday night of Memorial Day weekend. You may park your vehicle at the ugly campground but then walk 100 yards towards the river to find serene spots on the beach or under shady trees where you can set out your tent.
