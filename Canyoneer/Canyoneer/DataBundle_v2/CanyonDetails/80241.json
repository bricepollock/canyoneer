As the finish to the trifecta (second hamongog &amp; upper fort creek), we saved the best for last.  Two team members joined us for this final route.  It turned out to be better than imagined, and what I think is one of the best in the region.  This route will require a lot of effort compared to anything else in the Wasatch.  2  hour approach, 2000' vert, thick vegetation, bees (we all got a few stings), etc.  But well worth it for the adventurous soul.  \n<\/p><p>The canyon was ghosted using a fiddle (rated 4 for advanced rigging currently).  Future teams may decide to place webbing, though it isn't necessary.  So please try to keep it as pristine as possible. \n<\/p><p>Second descent 8\/12\/23 as a team of 4, doing the full drainage from Lake Hardy.\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>The main road is North Three Falls Way, and the turn off to the trailhead has a \"no trespassing\" sign (north aspen drive).  Driving this dirt road takes you to the TH parking, which appears to be legal by all the locals.  This is where we parked.  Starting your hike past the gate, you will stay on the dirt east of Schoolhouse Springs.  From the SHS approach it is 2.1 miles and 2100' of gain to get to the drainage, hiking up to the First Hamongog and then continuing east up past the East Hamongog.  When you get to the creek, head down the drainage, paralleling the creek until (with some small downclimbs) until you get to rap1.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>r1: 30'\n<\/p><p>r2: 30'\n<\/p><p>r3: 80' (2-stage)\n<\/p><p>r4: 40'\n<\/p><p>r5: 100'\n<\/p><p>r6: 100'\n<\/p><p>r7: 60'\n<\/p><p>r8: 100'\n<\/p><p>r9: 80'\n<\/p><p>r10: 80'\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>After a few exploration runs, an easy exit option was found by heading directly south up and over to Dry Creek.
