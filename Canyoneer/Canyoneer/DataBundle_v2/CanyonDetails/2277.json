Many of them can be downclimbed. The creek frequently flows over bedrock and can be slippery. There are two points of special interest:\n<\/p>\n<ul><li>Sweet Creek Falls: It's about 1.2mi from the Homestead Trailhead and has a vewing platform. The trial fords the creek below the falls and continues upstream on the west side. The falls is about 35ft into a deep pool, followed by two shorter drops. Rappel from a tree DCR set some distance back. Rappelling the chute directly may not be safe per a chockstone creating a sieve-like obstruction. This is a high-tourist area, so please do not leave fixed anchors. Below the pool, downclimb DCL on slippery rock. (alternately you could rappel from a short tree DCR.)<\/li><\/ul>\n<ul><li>Elk Wallow Gorge: The trail here becomes a catwalk which is bolted to the canyon walls. A tributary, Elk Wallow Creek, enters Sweet Creek in the Gorge - the waterfall is known as Annice Falls (35ft). This area is adjacent to the Sweet Creek Trailhead.<\/li><\/ul>\n<p><b>Other Notes:<\/b>\n<\/p>\n<ul><li>Per LIDAR, the best section looks to be starting just above Sweet Creek Falls and exiting at the Homestead Trail.<\/li><\/ul>\n<ul><li>Beaver Creek Falls is a small scenic waterfall at the confluence of Sweet Creek and Beaver Creek. It may not be worth your time.<\/li><\/ul>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Follow the trail back to your car.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Red_tape\">Red tape<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>A Northwest Forest Pass may be required for parking (?).\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Beta_sites\">Beta sites<\/h2><\/div>\n<ul><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20210527212206\/www.canyoneeringnorthwest.com\/SweetCreek\/Sweet_Creek.php\">CanyoneeringNorthwest.com (archive.org)<\/a> &#160;: Sweet Creek<\/li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http:\/\/summitpost.org\/sweetwater-falls-gorge\/842377\">SummitPost.org<\/a> &#160;: Sweetwater Falls Gorge<\/li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https:\/\/www.oregonhikers.org\/field_guide\/Sweet_Creek_Hike\">Oregon Hikers -
