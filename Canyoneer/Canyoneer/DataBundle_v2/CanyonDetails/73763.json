From there, find a way down through the forest to reach\nthe riverbed at a height of 780m (hasn't been tested yet)</p>\n<p>If you come from Monte Ceneri, just go to the start of the normal\nTrodo, but then walk up the river, take the tributary river uphill that\nis on the eastern side. That way you'll get around a small hill and can\ndo the second interesting section of Trodo Sup.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>It is possible to do it from the very top of the Valley, but only\ngets interesting from 780m above sea level on. There are two nice parts\nwith both 4 Waterfalls in it, in between there is 15 minutes of walking.\nAt the end, it's just 5 minutes of walking before reaching the start of\nTrodo Inf.</p>\n<p>There are some nice little jumps, with big enough pools to try\ntricks.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n",
