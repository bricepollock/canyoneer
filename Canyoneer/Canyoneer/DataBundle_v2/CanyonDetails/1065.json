Short and sweet, there are only 2-3 rappels. This canyon is best done in the spring when others in the area are running high.  The lower part of the gorge contains a short tourist trail with a geological anomaly known as the Boulder Cave. In aeons past, a large section of the overhanging cliff wall fractured off and bridged the creek, creating a 300ft long cave you can hike through.\n<\/p>\n<ul><li>Devil's Creek is easily combined with West Quartz Creek; another short creek located a mere 15min away.<\/li>\n<li>Devil's Creek is not to be confused with the nearby <a href=\"\/w\/index.php?title=Devils_Canyon&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Devils Canyon (page does not exist)\">Devils Canyon<\/a>.<\/li><\/ul>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>A well-maintained trail leads about 0.5mi from the parking area to the upper cave entrance. The upper section is accessed by hiking 0.5mile further upstream bushwacking through game trails. It may not be worth it. If you plan to do the whole canyon, it might be better to shuttle up to the top.

The falls goes through a pinch to a small pool, then drops free into a second pool. There is one sharp edge, so creep the rope. <i>Since there is no anchor at the last waterfall, you'll need 2 x 200ft ropes to be able to rappel to the very end.<\/i> (??)<\/li><\/ul>\n<p>The rappel drops into a beautiful little grotto.
