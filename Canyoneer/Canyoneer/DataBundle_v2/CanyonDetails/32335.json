  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>The Class 4 rating is for the final rappel which requires a safety\nline, or belay, to reach the bolts.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Trailhead:</strong> <em>38.09793, -108.81239</em></li>\n<li><strong>Drop In:</strong> <em>38.10765, -108.80267</em></li>\n<li><strong>First Rappel:</strong> <em>38.10236, -108.80724</em></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>From the Trailhead, follow a faint trail north along the dry creekbed\nfor about 500 feet, then veer right and up a large ramp and to a very\nunique sandstone tower that looks like two dog-head towers. Flank these\ntowers to the right at their base at 38.09952,-108.80772 and gain a flat\narea at 38.09768, -108.80560. From the flat area work your way east\nalong the bottom of the red sandstone wall and find a crack to climb up\nat 38.09740, -108.80424. Once on top of the red layer you need to find a\nway up through the white layer to gain the top of the cap rock. Just to\nthe right is a crack that is not too difficult but slightly exposed.\nOnce on top, head due north for about 1/2 mile and you will run into an\nold dirt road at 38.10387, -108.79978. Take the dirt road west about 1/4\nmile to the head of the canyon.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>The descent begins with several interesting pool crossings. Most can\nbe avoided on the right. Some simple stemming and down climbing is\nrequired. The first rappel is 150 feet and is bolted on the left. There\nis a small pool at the bottom of the rappel that can be easily avoided\nunder most conditions. From the bottom of the first rappel to the second\nrappel is a multi-tier ramp with water or ice in the middle. It can be\ndownclimbed but setting up a handline may be needed. The bolts for the\nsecond rappel are out on the right in a position suitable for\nice-climbing. To reach these bolts there may be a safety line in place,\nor you can self-belay the first person out from a set of bolts about 30\nfeet back on the left. The second rappel is 160 feet and is free-hanging\nfor about 100 feet. In winter these ledges can be icy and the degree of\ndifficulty and danger is much higher.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>Boulder hop down the drainage and around several pools for about\n20-30 minutes, then pop out left to the trail you came in on.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<p>2.16.2017: group of 7, sunny and dry, 5 hours. No ice. Upper section\npools were full. Pool at the bottom of the final rappel was dry. Someone\nhad left a long piece of webbing as a safety line to get to the bolts\nfor the final rappel.</p>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n",
