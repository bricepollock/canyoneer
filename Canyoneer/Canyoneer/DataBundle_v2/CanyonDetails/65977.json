It likely remains class B throughout the year with bouts of swiftwater during rains and in the spring, although it is not believed to be highly snowmelt driven.\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Located entirely within the Auburn State Recreation Area (Auburn SRA). Parking coordinates are given, for the shuttle it's at Gate 144 to Auburn SRA. Shuttle to the Knickerbocker side of the North Fork American by returning to Auburn and taking Highway 49 south. Park near the Cool Church.\n<\/p><p>The trails are a bit maze-y on the approach, so have a map handy. The trail crosses a fork of Knickerbocker but continue past to the second crossing. At the second crossing, about a mile in, you should be able to assess waterflow\/conditions.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Proceed downcreek, taking the path of least resistance when presented with brambles\/branches\/poison oak.

During summer, the flows are generally determined by the Oxbow recreational releases (<a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https:\/\/www.dreamflows.com\/Pages\/OxbowSchedule.php\">Schedule<\/a>). Scramble up the hillside to the road, then take the road and the Cardiac Bypass trail to your car.\n<\/p><p>Float exit: Bring a pfd, tube, or just rely on the buoyancy of your pack and float down to the easy trail that leads to the Oregon Bar river takeout. The river is very mild (no rapids) between the end of the canyon and the takeout point. It should be safe all summer as long as the dam is in release mode (<a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https:\/\/www.dreamflows.com\/graphs\/day.796.php\">Dreamflows gauge<\/a>). Always check levels and rely on your own judgement. Note, it costs $10 to leave a car at this exit point. It's a small lot, so it's recommended to leave any additional vehicles at the Parking Exit marked on the map.\n<\/p><p>No-shuttle exit (untested): Turn right at exit of canyon and make your way northwest along the riverbank to the marked trail.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Red_tape\">Red tape<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Auburn SRA closes at night, so carefully consider where you leave your car.
