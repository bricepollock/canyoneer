  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>A quick, but interesting and scenic section of non-technical\nconglomerate narrows near the Verde River. Easy, almost zero exposure\nbridging and climbing moves add some fun and will keep your feet dry if\nthe slot is holding water.</p>\n<p>How you get there depends a bit on where in Phoenix you are coming\nfrom. Navigate to the Needle Rock Beach Recreational area at 33.772111,\n-111.664977; drive all the way down Needle Rock Road to park at a sandy\nparking lot at the end of the road.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>From the parking area, hike up Camp Creek wash which is also 4x4\ntrail 413 - or of course you can drive right up to the canyon if you\nhave the proper vehicle. Hike northwest for 1 mile on this sandy, gravel\nroad to enter the canyon from the bottom. Locating the correct wash to\nbegin to hike up is the only trick, the wash leading to the narrows is a\nnice, clear gravel driveway of a wash with very little brush with and a\nfloor the same shade of tan and orange as the road - as opposed to the\ngray rocks in the washes of a few dead ends in the area.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>Explore the narrows climbing around and over the shallow pools as you\ngo until the canyon opens up at a confluence of the upper branches.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>Return the way you came.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<p>A Tonto pass ($6 per day) is required for use of this area - day use\nonly.</p>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a\nhref=\"https://www.facebook.com/pat.winstanley.7/media_set?set=a.1023365071055523.1073742049.100001461198708&amp;type=3&amp;uploaded=14\">https://www.facebook.com/pat.winstanley.7/media_set?set=a.1023365071055523.1073742049.100001461198708&amp;type=3&amp;uploaded=14</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n",
