The mid-way anchor station gets drenched by the rooster tail landing beside it. On a sunny day this station becomes a Rainbow Room - the water-filled air bursting to life with rings of chromatic light.\n<\/p><p>It is best run early in the season, or late after rain has replenished flows. By mid-summer it'll likely be running low and lack some character.\n<\/p><p>Access is mostly straightforward, making use of old forest roads.\n<\/p><p><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https:\/\/ropewiki.com\/Hungry_Bear_(Lower)\">Lower Hungry Bear<\/a>, the section below the approach road, has yet to be descended.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p><b>Drive<\/b>\n<\/p>\n<ul><li>From Sultan, take the Sultan Basin Rd 13 miles north to Olney Pass.<\/li><\/ul>\n<ul><li>Register at the gated entrance to the Spada Lake area.<\/li><\/ul>\n<ul><li>Take South Shore Rd 4.5 miles to small turn out on the right hand side.

This dense bushwacking can be avoided. Walk 30 yards past the old logging road to a culvert. Walk up the clean ditch from the culvert 50 feet up to the old logging road and proceed left.<\/li><\/ul>\n<ul><li>Follow the gently rising, overgrown road, east for 1.2 miles, crossing multiple wash-outs.<\/li><\/ul>\n<ul><li>Before the road bends Southeast, leave the road and head South and directly uphill through clear forest.<\/li><\/ul>\n<ul><li>Gain 600' until you reach the 2,585 feet elevation and a broad flat band. This is upper old logging road.<\/li><\/ul>\n<ul><li>Follow this upper road Southeast for 700' until it brings you to a dismantled bridge crossing at Bear Creek. BE CAREFUL OF LARGE SPIKES STICKING UP FROM THE BRIDGE DEBRIS. From here, the fastest and cleanest way to the creek is to head left down a gently curving slope to the creek. You will be below the first rappel. To access the first rappel requires a thick bushwack from the bridge debris right and up 30 yards.<\/li><\/ul>\n<p>There is very limited space to gear-up spot at the drop-in. There is a better open spot just on the creek side of the bridge debris pile.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p><b>NOTE:<\/b> Teams may prefer to back up single bolt anchors with meat anchors, or contribute to the canyon by installing second bolts where appropriate.\n<\/p>\n<ul><li><b>R1<\/b> – 25' from single bolt DCR.<\/li><\/ul>\n<ul><li><b>R2<\/b> – An easy, low-angle downclimb is recommended. Or rappel 30' from bolts DCR.<\/li><\/ul>\n<p>There is an exit just prior to the next drop, which is the headline two-stage rappel. The commitment zone begins with R3. \n<\/p>\n<ul><li><b>R3<\/b> – 90' from bolts DCL. Extending the rappel rope 100' in order to do a J-Tie is recommended. Visibility and sound are limited. There is an optional redirect bolt 10' down DCR to rappel in the flow. Rappel to the next anchor (R4) at the base of the rooster tail, which can be seen from the top, once the rappeller reaches the bottom of this pitch.<\/li><\/ul>\n<ul><li><b>R4<\/b> – 90' from bolts DCL, set back &amp; high up from the lip (needs slight climb up to them). A 200' rope is required for a better rope pull angle. In low-to-moderate flow the rebelay is out of the flow. In high flow this station will be in the forceful spray of the rooster tail, so plan on moving your party through quickly. Note, it may be possible to rappel from R3 the full 200' in one pitch, but the rope pull is unlikely.<\/li><\/ul>\n<ul><li><b>R5<\/b> - easy downclimb DCR is recommended. Or 20' nuisance rappel from single bolt DCL with awkward start onto a slippery log. This is followed by an easy 6' downclimb which can be done either in the flow or dry DCR.<\/li><\/ul>\n<ul><li><b>R6<\/b> - 40' from single bolt DCR, crack rappel. Keep foot out of the middle of the crack. This is followed by two small down-climbs. The first very straightforward, the second may be protected using a webbing handline around a log.<\/li><\/ul>\n<ul><li><b>R7<\/b> 70' from single bolt DCR. The whole flow is channeled through a staircase slot then down a series of ramps, forming rooster tails in places. Stemming on rappel is a good technique here.<\/li><\/ul>\n<p>It is possible to exit the canyon after R7 by scrambling up hill DCR, then descending on the ridge above the creek until intersecting with the old road. This is the only reasonable exit point (before the old road) after committing to R3. \n<\/p>\n<ul><li><b>R8<\/b> - 30' from single bolt DCR, nearly vertical. This is followed by a short downclimb, either in the flow DCL or easier DCR dry.<\/li><\/ul>\n<ul><li><b>R9<\/b> - 25' from boulder wrap, in the flow.
