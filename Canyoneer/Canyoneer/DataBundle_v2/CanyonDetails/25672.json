  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>Can be done as a Class II route if turning around at the rappel. If\ncontinuing down to the river it is Class IV due to the anchor problem.\nThere is scant material to work with. A water trap or sandtrap, if dry,\nmay work but must be bomber as you ascend up the 80 foot free hang to\nexit. A knot chock may be possible in the crack on right.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>Drop into the drainage where it crosses the White Rim Trail, a rocky\n4X4 road. The short slot is roughly 1,200 feet in length.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>Immediately you encounter a small downclimb, quickly followed by more\ndownclimbs, ranging from 5 feet up to 20 feet. Several pools can be\nstemmed over if wet. You must be able to reverse any move as this is a\ndown and back route.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>Reverse your course. All climbs are easily done with a partner\nassist.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<p>A back country day use permit from Canyonlands National Park is\nrequired and can be obtained online.</p>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><img src=\"rwl_en.png\" title=\"rwl_en.png\" alt=\"rwl_en.png\" /><a\nhref=\"http://americansouthwest.net/slot_canyons/holeman-slot/index.html\">AmericanSouthwest.net</a>\n: Holeman Slot; Utah</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n"
