The name “labyrinth” comes from the large number of odd rock formations in the area which form something of a natural maze.  This creek is not a major objective, but might be a good one when other creeks in the area are running high.  Labyrinth Creek dries up completely by mid-summer, so don't bother after that.  The creek can be fairly brushy in the late season.  Hit this one when it has good flow.\n<\/p><p>Beware poison oak throughout the area.\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading3\"><h3 id=\"Directions\">Directions<\/h3><\/div>\n<p>Head east on I-84 and cross the Hood River Bridge into Washington State.

Along the way pass the base of Rowland Lake Falls which is a good place to check the flow.  Eventually the cliffs subside and follow the obvious trail upwards, keeping right at all junctions.  The trail winds upwards and eventually parallels the creek.  Continue upwards, passing a small cave (goes back 20ft).  Note the waterfall directly ahead through the trees;  this is R2.  Follow the trail as it switchbacks up above the falls and head over to the creek when you see the slide (R1).\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Please do not leave anchors visible from the trail to discourage the unprepared from attempting to follow you. \n<\/p>\n<ul><li>R1:  15ft.
