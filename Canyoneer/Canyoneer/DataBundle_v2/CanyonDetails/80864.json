  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>Two known pitches, a possible third exists further downstream. The\nfirst is ~25m off a tree Creek Right into the crevice. The second is\n~40m down the main pitch.</p>\n<p>No existing natural anchors exist for this second pitch, however it\ncan be descended by using ~90m of rope attached to the tree atop the\nfirst pitch. This option will only work for a bounce trip.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>Can be done as a bounce trip (climb back up ropes).</p>\n<p>If intending on a through trip, be prepared to build a natural anchor\nusing rocks above the second pitch. Also be prepared for a possible 3rd\npitch futher downstream. A possible exit may exist downstream up one of\nthe ridges. Alternatively one could continue down the creek to the\nCasuarina camping area, however this would require a car shuffle.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n",
