{"waterRating":"B","rappelLongestMeters":27.43,"id":40971,"vehicle":null,"technicalRating":4,"riskRating":null,"longitude":-110.5336,"name":"Teeny Tiny Loop","timeRating":"III","description":"<div class=\"mw-content-ltr mw-parser-output\" lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><p>Tiny has an upper pothole section, an open middle section that makes a 90 degree left turn, and a bottom section consisting of two highly scenic, fee-hanging rappels. In the upper section there are countless ways to get through the series of about 10 potholes; two sandtrap rappels usually get it done most efficiently- after stemming over the first one and partner-capturing into the second one, set up a sandtrap rappel from the 3rd pothole of 40 foot through two potholes, then set up another sandtrap for a 50 foot 3-tier rappel. The exit described in Bluugnome seems to exit at the 1\/2 way point and misses two very worthwhile rappels. The penultimate rappel is anchored off a sandtrap and goes 85 feet down 3 tiers. Continue hiking down the drainage to a spectacular pouroff which can be anchored off a massive horn or numerous boulders and drops 75 feet, all free-hanging. Hike 5 minutes down the open wash at the bottom to a scramble up LDC to head directly to the viewpoint, or do an easy walk out RDC to head over to the Euphrates exit. Exiting this way takes 1 hour to 1 hour 15 minutes.\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<div
