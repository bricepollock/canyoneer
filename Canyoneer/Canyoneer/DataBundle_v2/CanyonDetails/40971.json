In the upper section there are countless ways to get through the series of about 10 potholes; two sandtrap rappels usually get it done most efficiently- after stemming over the first one and partner-capturing into the second one, set up a sandtrap rappel from the 3rd pothole of 40 foot through two potholes, then set up another sandtrap for a 50 foot 3-tier rappel. The exit described in Bluugnome seems to exit at the 1\/2 way point and misses two very worthwhile rappels. The penultimate rappel is anchored off a sandtrap and goes 85 feet down 3 tiers. Continue hiking down the drainage to a spectacular pouroff which can be anchored off a massive horn or numerous boulders and drops 75 feet, all free-hanging. Hike 5 minutes down the open wash at the bottom to a scramble up LDC to head directly to the viewpoint, or do an easy walk out RDC to head over to the Euphrates exit. Exiting this way takes 1 hour to 1 hour 15 minutes.\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Red_tape\">Red tape<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Beta_sites\">Beta sites<\/h2><\/div>\n<ul><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http:\/\/bluugnome.com\/cyn_route\/ticaboo\/ticaboo_teeny-tiny\/ticaboo_teeny-tiny.aspx\">BluuGnome.com<\/a> &#160;: Teeny Tiny Loop<\/li><\/ul>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Background\">Background<\/h2><\/div>\n\n\n<\/div>","months":["Mar","Apr","May","Sep","Oct","Nov"],"waterRating":"B","quality":4,"permit":"No","riskRating":null,"rappelCountMax":6,"longitude":-110.5336,"name":"Teeny Tiny Loop","version":"ddde8b0b8d7124cb8908485813d478cd471413d4fb8c0eaff5d148e94275da93"}
