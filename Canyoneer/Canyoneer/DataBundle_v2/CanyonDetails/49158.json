  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>ACCESS TO THIS CANYON IS PROHIBITIVE DUE TO THE REQUIRED RIVER\nCROSSING WHICH HAS BEEN THE SITE OF A CANYONEER FATALITY. The canyon is\nhigh quality with big beautiful waterfalls, beautiful deep potholes,\nslides, jumps, and plenty of excitement. In addition to the river\ncrossing, a heinous approach hike involving a 2600â€™ gain up steep,\ngrassy, pokey seed cover, sometimes overgrown and mostly hot and exposed\nto the sun is required. Access necessitates crossing the Middle and\nSouth Forks of the Kings River. There is nowhere to cross these rivers\nabove or below the confluence anywhere near Deer Canyon. It could likely\nbe possible (at least in low water years) to wait until the fall when\nflows on the Kings River have subsided substantially, but at this point\nDeer Canyon would almost certainly be dry and unexciting.</p>\n<p>SWIFTWATER TRAINING AND EXPERIENCE SWIMMING IN CLASS V RAPIDS IS\nREQUIRED OF ANYONE ATTEMPTING THIS ROUTE. On August 3rd, 2017, ropewiki\nand the canyoneering community lost not only a truly incredible person,\nbut one of our best, most skilled, and most prolific explorers at the\nriver crossing just below the confluence of the Middle and South Forks.\nIf the thought occurs to you to attempt this canyon, please respect the\nseriousness of this river crossing, and take the following advice:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>NEVER clip yourself into a rope crossing swift water, except perhaps\nwith the use of a rescue life jacket, and full knowledge of how to use\nit.</li>\n<li>Be fully prepared to swim whatever is downstream of your crossing if\nyou do not make it to the other side. This means wearing a\nspecial-purpose life jacket and having experience swimming in Class V\nwhitewater. There are Class V rapids throughout this section of\nriver.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The safest way to get across this river may be to have an experienced\nkayaker bring a fast whitewater kayak down to the river to ferry all\nother party members across individually (with life jackets). But that\nidea still carries a fair amount of risk.</p>\n<p>This is a very long canyon and is not advisable as a day trip. It\nwould be a far better idea to set a base camp at the river and go from\nthere. The canyon can be descended with some long awkward multi-stage\nrappels off of natural anchors, but a proper descent deserves some bolts\ninstalled by experienced canyoneers. With bolts installed, the longest\nrappel would probably be no more than 120 feet.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>Yucca Point Trail makes a convenient descent down to the confluence\nof the Middle and South Forks of the Kings River. This is where you will\nencounter the problem of getting to the other side.</p>\n<p>Note that a rock on the south side of the crossing makes it easy to\nget out to Deer Canyon, and very difficult to get back.</p>\n<p>If you can make it across the river, heading straight up the ridge on\nthe other side seems to be the best way up. Particularly the first 800\nfeet or so is awful. You'll climb to the top of the ridge at 4800 feet,\nfollow it down to a pass, then make your way down the North East slope\nto the creek. As this area is growing back in after the Rough Fire in\n2015, you will want to carefully scout your approach from Highway 180\nbefore you leave your vehicles. In all likelihood, this is going to get\nworse as the years go on.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>The canyon begins quickly with two waterfalls. The second can be\nrappelled through a narrow crack that makes for a challenging rappel and\ncan grab ropes. It might be better avoided.</p>\n<p>Boulder hopping follows and then eventually a really really fun\n(maybe slightly sketchy) S-turn slide. It looks scary, but seems to work\nout well.</p>\n<p>Further down is a rappel at a large boulder, and then a rappel into a\n90 degree left hand bend.</p>\n<p>What follows is the first of 3 gorges that can be descended top to\nbottom through long multi staged rappels. The last one of these is an\nawesome narrow slot that descends ~5 waterfalls, and will need 260 feet\nrope to descend in that way. Again, bolts would make this better.</p>\n<p>Another big drop follows, then the canyon slacks off into some hiking\nfor a long while, up to the top of a large waterfall you can see from\n180. We cut out of the canyon here, quite easily, to the East ridge by\ntraversing over, and followed the ridge down to the river, but it would\nbe worth continuing down if time allows.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>From the confluence of Deer Creek and the Middle Kings, you will need\nto cut up on some narrow sketchy deer trails to cut west along the river\ntoward the confluence. You'll likely drop down to the river bed a second\ntime, and soon have to cut onto deer trails for just a bit further to\nmake your way back down to the confluence.</p>\n<p>Again you will be faced with the challenge of cross the river, which\nagain, will be substantially more difficult from this side.</p>\n<p>Once across, return on the Yucca Point Trail.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n",
