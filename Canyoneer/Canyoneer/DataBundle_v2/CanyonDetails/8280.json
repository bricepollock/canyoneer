You MUST be prepared to ascend up ropes in order to exit the canyon.\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>When leaving a vehicle at the exit go and inspect the status of the static ropes at the exit. Do not count on finding any static ropes, be prepared to set up your own ropes (200ft to 300ft) so you can later safely climb out of the canyon to exit. The top of the fixed line for the exit can be found on a stout tree at 20.82843, -156.13426.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>The section above the highway includes one rappel into a large pool followed by several small jumps up to 20 feet and a gentle stream float in the right conditions. The section below the highway includes 4 more rappels, including the one at the bridge. A couple of these can be jumped mid-way down from ledges.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Make sure you station static ropes at the exit point at the beginning of the trip so you will be able to climb up to exit. The fixed rope for the exit ascent can be found at 20.82816, -156.13376. There is a conspicuous, large, blank white sign on a tree on canyon left marking the start of the early exit.\n<\/p><p>Continuing down-canyon past the fixed-line exit noted above involves exiting through the neighborhood of Wailua. Although most of the residents of Wailua are friendly, there are a minority of known hostile residents in the neighborhood who will use bully tactics. You have been warned.  In addition, the lower section to the beach is highly committing at the final sequence and involves big waterfalls. A 300-foot rope is needed for the final rappel, plus longer ropes to ensure the pull.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Red_tape\">Red tape<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Beta_sites\">Beta sites<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media<\/h2><\/div>\n<ul><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/media\/set\/?set=a.10150102420631103.301371.669366102&amp;type=1&amp;l=f36fa7dd8a\">Facebook Album<\/a><\/li><\/ul>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Background\">Background<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Although the drainage to the ocean is on Forest Reserve land and it is possible to hike on the old Kings Road trail from Wailua Iki Bay to Wailua Nui Bay to the west and reach a public beach there for your exit vehicle, this is a high-risk plan as the homeowners in Wailua Homesteads may have a different interpretation of what is legal access. It is not recommended to park on the beach as it is rocky, there isn't enough room to turn a vehicle around, and it would be a target all day and draw attention. It is probably better to park on the Hana Highway a short distance away from Wailua Road.\n<\/p>\n\n\n\n<\/div>","shuttleSeconds":null,"geojson":null,"rappelLongestMeters":45.72,"url":"https:\/\/ropewiki.com\/Carpool_(Lower_W._Wailua_Iki_Stream)","longitude":-156.1397,"vehicle":"Passenger","version":"ab2228249c45920e1c02b5e236906ead6ef108dddc15d4e709787afd04adb269","name":"Carpool (Lower W.
