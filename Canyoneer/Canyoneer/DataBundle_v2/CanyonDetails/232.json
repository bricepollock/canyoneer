A big 270-foot rappel. A 50-foot free-hang rappel at the finish. Very scenic approach.\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>To get out of Grand Wash to Bear Canyon, there are two key up-climb points. Following the prescribed waypoints will save you a lot of time. There are many ways to get up but any others will require more energy. To get from Bear Canyon up to the platform leading to Na Gah Fork, there is one point where the cairns seem to peter out at a cliff band. Instead of climbing all the way up and continuing west, you need to stay one level down and follow the ledge to the left and head east for a couple hundred yards, counterintuitive to the direction you are going overall. The up-climb involves stemming up a chimney. If no errors are made in route-finding, the approach should take 90 minutes.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Getting to the 2nd rappel, the big one, involves hiking past the initial drop and up the left side of the drainage for a couple minutes and then climbing down and back to get to the anchor. It would be easier and more fun to rappel off a tree canyon right at the pour-off to get down to the level of the anchor for the big rappel. The rope pull for the big rappel is best done from the chockstone about 100 feet above the floor. Everyone but LAMAR can rappel down to the floor and enjoy the 270 foot ride. LAMAR should stop on the chockstone 100 feet from the deck, pull the rope, and then use the chockstone anchor for the final 100 feet. The final rappel is set up for a courtesy anchor and is a nice free-hang.\n<\/p>\n<ul><li><b>R1<\/b>: 15ft - Anchored from a tree above the drop or, alternatively, a knot chalk on the LDC side.<\/li><\/ul>\n<ul><li><b>R2<\/b>: 275ft - Anchored from a rock near the top. The last 50 feet of the rap are down climbable so a shorter rope could be used if needed.<\/li><\/ul>\n<ul><li><b>R3<\/b>: 20ft - Anchored using a pinch point between a boulder and the canyon wall.<\/li><\/ul>\n<ul><li><b>R4<\/b>: 30ft - Anchored from a tree root and a bolt on the RDC side of a ledge.<\/li><\/ul>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Easy hike down the wash for 15 minutes.

Permits have a group-size limit that varies depending on the canyon or route.  A separate permit is required for each canyoneering route.  Currently, there is no quota limit nor permit cost, though that is likely to change at some point in the future.  Permits can be obtained onsite through a self-serve kiosk located just outside of the visitor center or by sending and email to care_permits@nps.gov using the following format:\n<\/p><p><b>Subject: <\/b> Name of canyoneering route and date you will be canyoneering. \n<\/p><p><b>Email Body: <\/b>\nDate of visit (single day only): \nCanyoneering route (single route only): \nNumber of people: \nVehicle location: \nNumber of motorized vehicles: \nVehicle description(s): \n<\/p><p>If you plan to camp overnight as part of a canyoneering trip, you are required to obtain a free backcountry permit, available at the visitor center. \n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading3\"><h3 id=\"Additional_Access_Information:\">Additional Access Information:<\/h3><\/div>\n<ul><li>CRNP canyoneering permit information webpage: <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external free\" href=\"https:\/\/www.nps.gov\/care\/planyourvisit\/canyoneering.htm\">https:\/\/www.nps.gov\/care\/planyourvisit\/canyoneering.htm<\/a><\/li>\n<li>Other: <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external free\" href=\"http:\/\/www.americancanyoneers.org\/access-capitol-reef\/\">http:\/\/www.americancanyoneers.org\/access-capitol-reef\/<\/a><\/li><\/ul>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading3\"><h3 id=\"Group-Size_Limit:\">Group-Size Limit:<\/h3><\/div>\n<p>Canyoneering groups are limited to a maximum of 8 people for this Canyon.\n<\/p><p>Groups larger than 8 or 12 sharing the same affiliation (school, church, club, scout group, family, friends, etc., or combination thereof) may divide into groups smaller than 8 or 12, provided they do not occupy the same canyon, drainage, general area or the same route on the same day.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading3\"><h3 id=\"Park_Entrance_Fee:\">Park Entrance Fee:<\/h3><\/div>\n<p>The Scenic drive is the only area of Capitol Reef where an entry fee or park pass is required.
