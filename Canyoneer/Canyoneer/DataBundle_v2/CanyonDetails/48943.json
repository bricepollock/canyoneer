  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>A gigantic tension fault-crack located north of Oakridge, OR. This is\nnot your typical canyon. It is not an aquatic canyon.</p>\n<p><font color=\"red\">WARNING!</font> Much of the Hellhole is composed of\nloose, crumbling, slippery rock. People have died here. Visiting on a\nwet day is not recommended. Wear a helmet; rockfall is a real threat.\nBring ropes and be on your game. Setting a rim rope ahead of time is\nrecommended to allow a safe escape.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>Follow a well-established user trail about 5min to the rim. The trail\nruns for a fair distance east and west on the north side of the rim\nleading to various not-really viewpoints. Given the sheer walls it's\ndifficult to get a clear view to the bottom. Beware getting too close to\nthe edge; it's a long way to the bottom. Beware kicking down rocks when\nyou rappel in. Area is very unstable.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<p>None.</p>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<p><a\nhref=\"http://www.opb.org/television/programs/ofg/segment/hell-hole/\">Oregon\nField Guide - 1997</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n<p>The Hellhole has been visited for many years, dating back at least as\nfar as the 1930's. It was likely discovered by local loggers. It was\nfirst evaluated for canyoning potential in Oct 2019 by Kevin Clark,\nVandy Bennett and Leah Sorenson.</p>\n",
