This is not your typical canyon.  It is not an aquatic canyon.\n<\/p><p><font color=\"red\">WARNING!<\/font> Much of the Hellhole is composed of loose, crumbling, slippery rock.  People have died here.  Visiting on a wet day is not recommended.  Wear a helmet; rockfall is a real threat.  Bring ropes and be on your game.  Setting a rim rope ahead of time is recommended to allow a safe escape.\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Follow a well-established user trail about 5min to the rim.  The trail runs for a fair distance east and west on the north side of the rim leading to various not-really viewpoints.  Given the sheer walls it's difficult to get a clear view to the bottom.  Beware getting too close to the edge;  it's a long way to the bottom.  Beware kicking down rocks when you rappel in.  Area is very unstable.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Red_tape\">Red tape<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>None.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Beta_sites\">Beta sites<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media<\/h2><\/div>\n<p><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http:\/\/www.opb.org\/television\/programs\/ofg\/segment\/hell-hole\/\">Oregon Field Guide - 1997<\/a>\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Background\">Background<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>The Hellhole has been visited for many years, dating back at least as far as the 1930's.
