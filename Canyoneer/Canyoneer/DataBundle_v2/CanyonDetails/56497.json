Note: the approach roads to this canyon was overrun by the Big Hollow fire in 2020, although the canyon itself was not touched. You may wish to check on status of the access roads before planning a trip here.<\/b>\n<\/p><p>A series of falls in a short spectacular narrows on Paradise Creek.  This destination has a very high pay-to-play.  That said, this section of the creek would get run all the time if it wasn't such a bear to get in and out.  You've been warned: the exit is brutal.\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Expect the approach to take at least an hour.  Getting through the clear cut up at the top is the worst part.  Once into open forest, travel goes a lot faster.\n<\/p><p>Alternatively, walking up the creek via Wind River rd isn’t terrible. Very mellow until you hit the landslide area. Creek bed could be a distraction as it is loaded with agates.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<ul><li>R1:  10ft.  Short into deep pool.<\/li><\/ul>\n<p>Just ahead the creek starts to narrow up.  Enter a nice narrows section.\n<\/p>\n<ul><li>R2:  60ft two-stage rappel, tree DCR.  Drops to shallow pothole and then turns a corner for the second tier.<\/li>\n<li>R3:  20ft from cairn into a quasi-swimmer.  Beware large log leaning against the falls.<\/li>\n<li>R4:  40ft low angle rappel through a nice narrows.  Might be downclimbable, but probably safer to rappel. Chest-deep pool at the bottom.  Very pretty spot. Single Bolt DCL<\/li><\/ul>\n<p>Below, encounter a 4ft step. Downclimb on either side.  Just around the corner, the walls soar a hundred feet overhead.  Pass through a nice bedrock section to reach the top of the next drop.  Climb \/ slide down a couple of large logs wedged in the opening.  These logs form the anchor for the next rappel.\n<\/p>\n<ul><li>R5:  125ft. Single Bolt DCL.<\/li>\n<li>R6:  60ft.  Anchor on a tree DCL.<\/li>\n<li>R7:  40ft messy rappel. Single Bolt DCL.   (Can skip the rappel by exiting the canyon completely... directly up very steep slopes DCR.)<\/li><\/ul>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Get ready for a serious workout as you need to ascend \/ bushwhack up some Very Steep slopes DCR up about 1000ft to get back to the plateau and make your way back to the car.  Literally going on all fours is easier in some place as it's so steep.\n<\/p><p>Another equally unpleasant option might be stream-walking ~2mi the road at the Paradise Creek campground.
