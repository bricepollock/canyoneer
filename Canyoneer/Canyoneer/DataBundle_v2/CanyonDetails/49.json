If you don't have much Class C experience,\ngo do <a href=\"Seven_Teacups\" title=\"wikilink\">Seven Teacups</a> or do\n<a href=\"Big_Creek\" title=\"wikilink\">Big Creek</a> first to gain\nexperience. And DEFINITELY try to hook up with someone that has done\nthis canyon to go with you; it may well save you a trip to the hospital\nand months of rehab. Some of the injuries that have happened:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Several people have plummeted tens of feet off cliffs after slipping\nfrom the edges</li>\n<li>Several people broke legs, ribs, ankles and knees while doing some\nof the slides</li>\n<li>Several people twisted or dislocated ankles and fingers while\nwalking in the stream</li>\n<li>At least two people have fractured vertebrae in their backs on high\njumps -- on the 52' initial and and 32' Black Hole, and both were very\nexperienced canyoneers.</li>\n<li>A person jumped from 6' into pool of water, and hit knee on edge of\nunseen rock 2-3' below surface. Snapped ligaments in back of his\nknee.</li>\n<li>A person attempted to swim through the waterfall into the Rainbow\nRoom, panicked in the water and sunk 10' below surface needing a\nlifeguard rescue.</li>\n<li>A person rappelled straight down the big waterfall (without using\nthe rebelay), had trouble getting off rope at bottom because his pack\nhad no buoyancy. He started gasping and dropped pack to bottom of pool\nlosing the entire pack and all contents.</li>\n<li>A person had their rope sever completely on the sharp edge of the\nBig Kahuna rappel, free-falling 35'. Luckily landed into water</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There have been multiple helicopter rescues over the years in this\ncanyon due to injuries. DO NOT take any chances if you do not intimately\nknow the canyon. ALWAYS have someone in your group rappel first on rope\nto scout out a safe place for the others to jump.</p>\n<h3 id=\"water_flow\">Water Flow</h3>\n<p>Gauge readings from the sensor in between <a href=\"Jump_Trip_(Upper)\"\ntitle=\"wikilink\">Upper Jump Trip</a> and <a href=\"Jump_Trip_(Lower)\"\ntitle=\"wikilink\">Lower Jump Trip</a> may be found at <a\nhref=\"http://www.dreamflows.com/graphs/day.450.php\">Dreamflows</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>The drive to Jump Trip is often long (5-6 hours from both Los Angeles\nand the Bay Area), and the additional necessity of setting a long car\nshuttle can make for challenging logistics.</p>\n<h3 id=\"drive_to_campground\">Drive to campground</h3>\n<p>Note that cell service is poor or non-existent in the entire Jump\nTrip area. The nearest reliable cell service is at a turnout atop a hill\non Trimmer Springs Rd at 36°53'01.3\"N 119°12'58.0\"W, marked with a sign\nas \"Cell Site\".</p>\n<h4 id=\"black_rock_campground\">Black Rock campground</h4>\n<p>Black Rock campground is currently open, with no fee for camping\nuntil further notice. There is usually water at the campground during\nthe summer, but at times it is turned off. Due to the forest fire in\n2016 there is now limited shade.</p>\n<p><a\nhref=\"http://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/sierra/recreation/camping-cabins/recarea/?recid=66085&amp;actid=29\">Black\nRock campground</a> is a $14/night + $5/additional vehicle campsite\nlocated near the trail head of <a href=\"Jump_Trip_(Upper)\"\ntitle=\"wikilink\">Upper Jump Trip</a> and the Black Rock Reservoir. It is\ncooler at 4300 ft elevation with shade from many pine trees, but insects\nare often a problem.</p>\n<p>Drive to Balch Camp; this is roughly 1.5 hours from civilization\noutside the mountains and cell reception is very poor over most of this\nentire distance. At Balch Camp, take two vehicles up the road on the\nright (LDC of the east fork of the river) leading to the power house and\npark one vehicle in the large dirt area on the river side of the road\njust before the gate and fences of the power house. Return to Balch Camp\nin the second vehicle and take the next turn on the right to cross just\none bridge and start heading up the mountain. After a few switchbacks,\nthe road will parallel the entire Jump Trip route (Lower and Upper) as\nyou ascend with the mountain on your left. The set of two penstocks (not\nthe single one) indicates the end of Lower Jump Trip. If this is your\nfirst trip, and especially if you are arriving after dark, be very\ncareful on the section of road following the first scary bridge,\nparticularly on a sharp left turn. Ten miles and ~30 minutes after the\nbridge in Balch Camp, take the right fork onto a dirt road. 1.2 miles\nlater, you will arrive at Black Rock campground. There are sites to the\nleft and to the right of the road you drove in on; see the <a\nhref=\"http://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/sierra/recreation/camping-cabins/recarea/?recid=66085&amp;actid=29\">Forest\nService web site</a> for details (or just search for Black Rock\ncampground if that link is broken).</p>\n<h4 id=\"kirch_flat_campground\">Kirch Flat campground</h4>\n<p><a\nhref=\"http://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/sierra/recreation/camping-cabins/recarea/?recid=45504&amp;actid=29\">Kirch\nFlat campground</a> is on the main Kings River before you drive up the\nNorth Fork. As of 2023, camping is free but the seasonal camp host is\nstrictly enforcing rules. It is an alternative to Black Rock. It is\napproximately 40 minutes closer to civilization than Black Rock making\nfor a shorter drive in and a MUCH easier meeting point for people\narriving (typically after dark), but will also be a longer drive up to\nbegin either Upper or Lower Jump Trip in the morning. Also, it is at\n1300 ft elevation making it much warmer than Black Rock. Partial shade\nat many of the sites and proximity to the river somewhat mitigates the\nheat. The campground is first-come and may fill up on weekends. There is\nno potable water here.</p>\n<h3 id=\"hike_drop_in\">Hike Drop-In</h3>\n<p>In the morning, drive 2.4 miles from Black Rock (or 13.6 miles from\nKirch Flat) to the wide dirt parking area with a gated dirt road on its\nsoutheast side (36.909594, -119.053449). Hike on the old road bed beyond\nthe gate 0.8 miles (-540 ft elevation) to the cliffs above the water --\nthis is the exit of <a href=\"Jump_Trip_(Upper)\" title=\"wikilink\">Upper\nJump Trip</a> and the start of Lower Jump Trip.</p>\n<h3 id=\"express_drop_in\">Express Drop-In</h3>\n<p>For a much shorter, steeper and quicker drop-in directly to the\nEntrance Exam, park at 36.90346, -119.05374 right near the \"winding\nroad\" yellow diamond road sign. Hike down the boulders immediately\nbeyond the road sign (facing sign, toward Blackrock), down a granite\nslab with Manzanita on the right. Follow the well trimmed trail down\nsteeply to the grassy area above the Entrance Exam shelf.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<h3 id=\"first_section\">First section</h3>\n<p>The first 0.8 miles of Lower Jump Trip contain many of the best parts\nof the entire canyon. Any time there is a jump, all but one member of\nyour group can easily avoid it by having one person meat-anchor a\nrappel. Before jumping, always have a member of your team check the\ndepth of the pool below.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Drop in (aka Entrance Exam)</strong>: Rappel from two bolts\nRDC about a hundred yards to the pool below. Alternately, find a spot\nRDC slightly up canyon of the bolts and <a\nhref=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nd3qQK8Rmu0\">jump 52' into the\npool</a>. This jump is referred to as the 'Entrance Exam'. The entry for\nsuch a large jump must be excellent to avoid injury. A third option, and\nthe original jump, was into the small pothole on the right side of the\nwaterfall, 15' - 20'. It is a narrow landing zone made narrower by a\nboulder hidden in the waterfall froth. Not recommended. There is also a\nbolted anchor to rappel in here, ~30'. Finally, a fourth recent\nvariation is to edge around to the right below the cliff above you,\nuntil you are facing the waterfall. Then it is a clean drop just by\nstepping off, 20-30'.</li>\n<li><strong>First jump</strong>: A hundred yards down canyon of the drop\nin, jump approximately 24' from the ledges on the LDC of the waterfall.\nIt is also possible to jump on the right from the top of the waterfall\nitself, but you must jump far enough horizontally to clear the\nrocks.</li>\n<li><strong>Split falls</strong>: AKA \"Jungle Ride\". On the other side\nof the pool from the first jump, there is a 25' jump that is from\nbetween two cascades under normal flow conditions. This is where the\nbanner picture from this page was taken.</li>\n<li><strong>Climb around</strong>: Climb around the next waterfall\nLDC</li>\n<li><strong>Left turn</strong>: The canyon makes an appreciable left\nturn</li>\n<li><strong>Play jumps</strong>: Depending on the route taken, you may\nneed to jump back into the water. You can jump from either side and\nclimb back up to do it again.</li>\n<li><strong>Dead tree anchor</strong>: Bolted in 2017. Go to the end of\nthe big pool and exit RDC just before the waterfall. Climb directly to\nthe right of the water course to ledge. Using double bolt station,\nrappel down the slippery RDC side of the waterfall to the large pool\nbelow. The distance from the bolts to the water is around 110'. In the\npast, before the tree died and fell and before it was bolted, people\nclimbed around this from the rocky ledge above.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"waterpark\">Waterpark</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Pool slide</strong>: After having someone check the depth,\nslide off a 5' ledge just left of center into the pool below</li>\n<li><strong>Person hole</strong>: Right above the first of a series of\nlarge pothole pools, there is a small pothole filled with water that can\nfit only one person. You can enter this pothole and usually stand on\ngravel, and get yourself out.</li>\n<li><strong>Pothole slide</strong>: The next pothole has a stream\nflowing into the top of it, and it is deep enough to slide over the edge\nand drop</li>\n<li><strong>Washing machine</strong>: The final pothole in this section\nhas a swirling current and smooth slippery exit ledge, and you may find\nyourself and your group circling several times before being able to\nclimb out</li>\n<li><strong>Bumpy slide</strong>: Shortly down canyon, there is what\nappears to be a very nice long slide, but beware that it sends you\ndirectly at the right wall and has caused several ankle injuries. It is\nbest to wet the rock on the left of the main watercourse and slide down\nthere. Be prepared for a bumpy descent and be very careful not to injure\nyour ankles by getting them caught during the descent.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"big_drop_section\">Big drop section</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Black hole</strong>: As you near the big rappel of the\ncanyon, observe the old rusted chain anchor up the rock LDC of the\npour-over. You can rappel from this anchor, or jump 32' from the LDC\nledge closest to the pool into the pool below.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Big rappel</strong>: <strong>Single Stage or Two Stage\nrappel off sets of bolts:</strong> There is limited room on the rock at\nthe far side of the black hole pool (top of 1st stage); be sure to\nsequence wisely. At typical flows of the canyon of 12cfs or less, it is\neasy to swim to the edge and stop yourself without going over. Climb up\nLDC well out of the water to bolted anchor with webbing; rappel roughly\n130' to the large pool below. In moderate flows, rappel in the\nwatercourse as it is excellent fun. Remember <a href=\"Swift_water\"\ntitle=\"wikilink\">swift water techniques</a> and lower your head to\ncreate a pocket of breathable air while immersed in the waterfall. Be\nsure to avoid any pendulum movement as <strong>a number of groups have\nexperienced coreshots while rappelling in the flow</strong><a\nhref=\"#fn1\" class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref1\"\nrole=\"doc-noteref\"><sup>1</sup></a><a href=\"#fn2\" class=\"footnote-ref\"\nid=\"fnref2\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><sup>2</sup></a>; <strong>Two\nStage:</strong> It may be wiser to use the rebelay station LDC to reduce\nthe chance of a core shot. This station is located 30' down from the top\nanchor on the ledge LDC, and consists of 2x new bolts (further left), 2x\nvery old bolts with chains (a button head with open shut and #12) and 2x\n3/8\" stud (not in use). Note <strong>station has been rebolted on\n9/3/2017 by Dominik and Itaru</strong> with SS 1/2\" powers bolts and SS\nhangers, much nicer!</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Narrows jump</strong>: After a few more small jumps or\nslides, enter the narrows and avoid a difficult descent through a pinch\nby climbing up RDC on a rock bench. At the end of the bench, jump\napproximately 20' into the narrows water course.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>No-jump pothole</strong>: After the canyon turns left, there\nis a sequence of potholes to navigate. One of them looks like an\nappealing jump, but has a rock that can be dangerously concealed just\nbelow the surface. Make sure to check depths.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Big Kahuna</strong>: Do not approach the waterfall just\nafter the potholes directly; instead, follow the rock bench RDC up to a\nnarrow cliff overlooking the pool below. The canyon register is in this\narea if you can find it. Using bolts RDC, rappel 80ft to the pool\nbelow.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Slick Jump</strong>: Locate a ledge system on LDC, traverse\nout to the center of ledge, and jump 20' into the LDC side of the\npothole below. The approach to the ledge slopes downward toward the pool\nand can be extremely slippery -- multiple people have fallen at this\nspot. There may be one or more bolts LDC in a small alcove near the\nground that can be used for belay out to the edge of the jump, or rappel\nif necessary. (A handline was also present here as of early 2020.)</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Big Jump</strong>: Jump 36' to the pool below from the RDC\nside of the cliffs, or downclimb to the pool LDC. Exit the pool on its\nRDC side at the pourover or along the wall by pulling up on webbing from\nthe bolt on the RDC wall, or cross the waterfall below the pool if you\ndownclimbed.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Rainbow Room</strong>: From two bolts on horizontal rock\ntucked just down canyon of a rock wall, rappel into the Rainbow Room.\nThe approach to these bolts can be tricky and a belay may be warranted.\nA single bolt above the \"Big Jump\" pool can be used to anchor a handline\nto access the Rainbow Room anchor if the ledge is slippery. (This bolt\nwas installed with webbing to assist in pulling oneself out of the pool\nto avoid the pourover in higher flow.) Be careful of rope pull issues\nwhen retrieving the rope; consider swimming or throwing the pull side\nout and far away from the rappel before <a href=\"LAPAR\"\ntitle=\"wikilink\">LAPAR</a> rappels. Swim through the narrow channel\nunder a waterfall and out the other side. Alternately, downclimb LDC to\nskip this rappel (but be sure to swim back through the waterfall into\nthe Rainbow Room; it is great fun). Alternatively, jump 55', but the\nlanding is very narrow.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Matrix jump</strong>: After exiting the Rainbow Room, jump\ninto the next pool from the RDC side of the waterfall being careful to\navoid the submerged rock.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"express_exit\">Express Exit</h3>\n<p>For a short version of Lower Jump Trip, you can climb back up to the\nroad (900 feet gain over 0.35 miles) on a well trimmed trail. About 200\nfeet past the Matrix Jump is a corner of rock that is easy to scramble\nup at 36.89797, -119.06210. Following this trail takes you to 36.90203,\n-119.06224 on the road above, about 1/2 mile from the express drop-in;\nmore details in exit section (below). By using the express drop-in and\nexpress exit, Lower Jump can be done non-shuttle, but this cuts off the\nMiddle and Last Section (below).</p>\n<h3 id=\"middle_section\">Middle section</h3>\n<p>The canyon opens up at this point and there are nearly 2 miles of\nhiking, creek hopping, downclimbing, and very long pools to swim. Save\nsome energy for this lower section and enjoy the beauty that is there.\nThe following descriptions are only for a few of the most distinctive\ndifficulties or locations.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Dry Slide</strong>: Downclimb in a crack RDC of a diagonally\nsloping slab of smooth granite on the right side of a narrow cascade.\nSome people also used to scoot out on the dry slope, run down it and\nthen fling themselves into the deep water as it got too steep. The swim\nfollowing is about 60 yards.</li>\n<li><strong>Long Pool</strong>: This pool is about 200 yards which seems\nlike a really long ways to swim with packs and boots.</li>\n<li><strong>The Water Gardens</strong>: A place to stop and marvel at\nhow the water has cut intersecting and parallel channels.</li>\n<li><strong>Second Pool</strong>: AKA 20th or 30th pool! This swim is\nabout 130 yards long. The entrance is interesting. A thick rib of dark\nrock sticks out from the left. The water spirals around the right\nthrough 3 potholes. Each is deep enough to drop into, but check first.\nThere is also a jump of 20' from the rib to the bottom pool, but the\nonly deep landing zone is tiny and invisible from above.</li>\n<li><strong>MiniGorge</strong>: The canyon starts to close up again but\nthe walking is easy on bedrock. Pass a giant pothole to the side of the\nstream. In 2010 or 2011, a large rockslide clogged the end of this\nsection with sharp edged boulders. There are another slide or two here\nif you have an eye out for fun...</li>\n<li><strong>Tricky Downclimb</strong>: Where the rockslide ends, the\nstream tumbles down into a small pool cluttered with rocks. Some giant\nboulders block the downcanyon view, but there are passages underneath\nthem. There are plenty of rocks and horns to anchor a short 15 foot\nrappel LDC, or there is a moderately difficult crack to downclimb from a\nledge on RDC. Rocks have fallen from the hillside and filled in part of\nthe canyon beneath the downclimb. The crack is no longer needed as you\ncan do an easy downclimb on RDC due to the new debris.</li>\n<li><strong>Big pool</strong>: Either take a running jump to clear a\nsmall tree with rocks directly below, or climb slightly LDC and slide\ninto the pool</li>\n<li><strong>Lateral Downclimb</strong>: Downclimb a fairly long and very\nexposed slab on RDC, typically by climbing up the slab about 40' RDC,\ntraversing across, and back down. Good spot to set a handline or a\nbelay. Jump into the narrow, hanging pool, then jump into the large pool\na few feet below (after checking depth for both).</li>\n<li><strong>Toboggan Warm Up</strong>: The hiking changes from rock\nhopping to bedrock with very easy walking on the RDC shoulder above some\nvery pretty pools. The slabs make for easy walking, but if you have time\nand energy left, stay in the water course for some great jumps and\nbeautiful swims.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"last_section\">Last section</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Pre-Toboggan</strong>: As the canyon rounds the corner to\nface Patterson Creek Falls, the river pools up and then drops ~20 ft,\noffering a decent jump or an entertaining slide down the\nwatercourse.</li>\n<li><strong>Toboggan</strong>: As the canyon opens up, there is a large\nboulder RDC. Follow the edge of this boulder around to either side to\nfind a long slide the drops into a pool. The right most slide drops\ncleanly. After checking the depth, slide down into the pool -- this is\none of the most fun features of the canyon.</li>\n<li><strong>Big Waterfall</strong>: This cascade is about 300 feet long.\nThere is potential to stay in the watercourse or to do rappels to either\nside.\n<ul>\n<li>If rappelling in the watercourse, find a single bolt at the top and\nrappel 135' into the hanging pool. The bolt is tucked in an upstream\ncrease of rock inches above the water just RDC of the main watercourse.\nIn July 2018, the bolt was just a stud missing its hanger and nut, about\nthe size of a standard quick link, so likely a 10mm stainless steel\nPetzl nut.</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><ul>\n<li>There should be good opportunities for a rock chock anchor far RDC\nthat deposit the canyoneer on the slabs just above the hanging pool. Or\npossibly a bush anchor.</li>\n<li>LDC of the main water course, there is a small trickle of water that\nflows over the cliff edge. Farther LDC of this trickle is a large\nindentation with cracks that present a good opportunity for a knot\nchock. The fall line of the rope from this anchor meets the trickle of\nwater at the cliff edge and descends to the LDC corner of the hanging\npool, a few feet up canyon of the bolt for the second stage.</li>\n<li>Once in the hanging pool (which is out of sight from above, except\nfrom far RDC), exit the pool and rappel from a second single bolt on the\nLDC lip of the pool 125' to the water below. It is ok for the rope to be\n5-15' short as the last part of the rappel is a slide. As of July 2018,\nthis bolt appeared to be pulled out of the rock by approximately\n3mm.</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><ul>\n<li>Single bolts should generally be considered suspect and a meat\nanchor backup is recommended for all but <a href=\"LAPAR\"\ntitle=\"wikilink\">LAPAR</a>.</li>\n<li>Alternately, there is also an easy hike to bypass both stages of the\nbig waterfall on LDC. Walk on slabs to the left. Do some butt scooting\nhere and there. At the base of the first slab downclimb you should find\nthe start of a trail. You can rappel 100' off a bush here into the pool\nbelow. Otherwise follow a trail on some terraces all the way around to a\ncliff wall on the left. Use a hand line to climb down a corner crack far\nLDC against a rock wall. There used to be a beautiful stand of pine\ntrees at the base of this downclimb. Now, they are fallen logs that you\nhave to climb over.</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"Patterson_Creek\" title=\"wikilink\">Patterson\nCreek</a></strong>: It is easy to miss, but look for a light spray from\nthis creek RDC across from the handline down climb.</li>\n<li><strong>Boulder Maze</strong>: AKA The Final Slog. The Boulder Maze\nis only about 160 yards long, but it feels much longer and probably is\nwith all zigzagging and dead ends. It helps to be a really good climber\nor fresh with lots of energy in this section, but it comes at the end of\nthe day when you will be dog tired. This is an easy section to injure an\nankle or worse. Spot and help each other. Generally, the easiest path is\nto go far LDC until you are past the first significant drop, then take a\nhard right, and stay RDC. In low flows, the second half can be followed\nalong the water course on RDC, but in higher flows, scrambling along the\nright side but to the left of the flow is easiest.</li>\n<li><strong>Running Rock</strong>: This is an alternate jump 15', RDC\nnear the end of the Boulder Maze next to a narrow channel against the\nright side of the canyon. You can just jump, but running down it seemed\nto be the thing to do in the early days, so it got that name.</li>\n<li><strong>Last Jump</strong>: This is a final 30' jump into the pool\nbelow. Alternatively there is a handline (chain) on LDC where people\nclimb up to go swimming and jumping. You can use the existing rope to\ndownclimb or rig your own rappel rope on the gigantic rebar anchors.\nFrom the pool below, climb the talus slope to a graded area.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"water_flow_1\">Water flow</h3>\n<p>Safe water flow is approximately 12 cfs, but perhaps as high as 15\ncfs for experienced and well-equipped canyoneers. Winter and spring\nflows are often much higher than this, and releases from the Black Rock\nreservoir upstream have resulted in flows in excess of 6000 cfs. 4 cfs\nmakes for an enjoyable trip, but without many serious class C\nchallenges. Gauge readings from the sensor in between <a\nhref=\"Jump_Trip_(Upper)\" title=\"wikilink\">Upper Jump Trip</a> and Lower\nJump Trip may be found at <a\nhref=\"http://www.dreamflows.com/graphs/day.450.php\">Dreamflows</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<h3 id=\"bypass_trail\">Bypass trail</h3>\n<p>From the graded area by the powerhouse head directly over to the\ncliff LDC. A rough path marked with a sign follows the base of the cliff\nsteeply uphill until you can look down on the powerhouse. At the high\npoint, the trail meets a chain link fence. After 100' of elevation gain,\nthe trail will begin to descend and will end across the street from the\ndirt parking area; head downhill on the outside of the fence to the\nparking area. PG&amp;E employees spray the poison oak once a year or so,\nbut don't otherwise maintain this trail. If you have trouble finding the\nstart of the trail, look farther up canyon where the shear rock wall\nmeets the dirt section of the hill.</p>\n<h3 id=\"alternate_exit\">Alternate Exit</h3>\n<p>While at jump 6/18/15 some locals showed us how they do it. At the\nend we jumped the last pool and hiked down under the power station 140\nyards and made another little jump 5'(be careful)and jumped back in the\nriver and swam 160 yards along the powerhouse-when you see the water\npouring out Balch PH start swimming over the shore just past the fence\nyou'll see some old thick wire and Black Berry bushes and a piece of a\ndowned wooded power pole next to a big brown rock-go up that trail and\nit will take to the road, about 40' from the cars. This route can save\ntime and effort by eliminating the need to hike up the Balch powerhouse\nbypass trail. However, one should exercise caution when attempting this\nroute, as the discharge from Balch powerhouse can potentially create\nstrong and cold currents that make the swim more challenging.</p>\n<h3 id=\"express_exit_1\">Express Exit</h3>\n<p>About 200 feet past the Matrix Jump is a corner of rock that is easy\nto scramble up at 36.89797, -119.06210. Use the ledges on the left side\nuntil you reach a boulder where it's obviously been pruned. Follow the\npath in the dirt and the cut plants up steeply past a short hand line to\na flatter area (about 200 feet vertical up) Follow the rock cairns in\nthe small clear areas and other trail markers under the Manzanita up\nanother 600 feet vertical. In the last 200 feet the path is not as well\ndefined and traverses quite a bit left (down canyon) at time reaching\nthe parking spot at 36.90200, -119.06223. You gain about 900 vertical\nfeet in 0.35 miles horizontal and you are only 0.6 miles on the road to\nthe Express Drop-In point.</p>\n<p>List of coords for the Express Exit trail:</p>\n<p>36.89869, -119.06271</p>\n<p>36.89913, -119.06304</p>\n<p>36.89968, -119.06256</p>\n<p>36.89998, -119.06236</p>\n<p>36.90022, -119.06222</p>\n<p>36.90028, -119.06209</p>\n<p>36.90045, -119.06205</p>\n<p>36.90058, -119.06210</p>\n<p>36.90092, -119.06211</p>\n<p>36.90143, -119.06208</p>\n<p>36.90173, -119.06221</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<p>This canyon has been the site of many accidents and injuries. To\navoid unwanted scrutiny and possible future restrictions, please be\nextra careful to avoid the need for emergency services.</p>\n<p>The water flow in this canyon is controlled by dam release from the\nBlack Rock reservoir. If the reservoir is close to full, this canyon can\nbe extremely dangerous as large water releases are more likely under\nthat circumstance. This reservoir is visible from the south end of the\ncampground and should be checked visually before beginning a descent. It\nmay be possible to drive to the PGE Balch Camp HQ and/or call them at\n559-487-6275 to confirm dam release plans. They also have free wifi at\nthe Balch Camp HQ.</p>\n<p>PG&amp;E does not want anyone inside the fences of the power house.\nUse the LDC bypass trail instead of attempting to cut through the power\nhouse grounds.</p>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<p>July 16, 2019 {{#ev:youtube|KHQYPV57gX0}}</p>\n<ul>\n<li><img src=\"rwl_en.png\" title=\"rwl_en.png\" alt=\"rwl_en.png\" /><a\nhref=\"http://brennen.caltech.edu/swhikes/nkings.htm\">Chris Brennen's\nAdventure Hikes (Southwest)</a> : North Fork of Kings River</li>\n</ul>\n<p>{{#ev:youtube|FbgGI6pgbDU}} {{#ev:youtube|iKIlw7ID-lQ}}</p>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<p>Areas near Jump Trip burned in the Rough Fire of 2015. <a\nhref=\"https://www.facebook.com/michelle.nilles/media_set?set=a.1250236021669965.1073741913.100000507366132&amp;type=3\">This\nalbum</a> contains pictures soon after that fire.</p>\n<p>{{#ev:youtube|F_kLpgDfwrs}} {{#ev:youtube|1UVWTy2KFXY}}\n{{#ev:vimeo|31640024}}</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_BLLdil66g\">Video from\nSeptember 2011</a></li>\n<li><a\nhref=\"http://g-funk.smugmug.com/Sports/Canyoneering/Lower-Jump-Trip/10426893_h23B5#!i=722815253&amp;k=dYRLH\">Pictures\nfrom September 2009</a></li>\n<li><a\nhref=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/madzoy/sets/72157606825745121/\">Pictures\nfrom 2008</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n<p>Paul Martzen was an early pioneer of this route and has much\nadditional background information. Regarding the toboggan near the end:\n\"Discovered accidentally around 1988 when Carl was out far ahead of the\ngroup, stepped on the slime and thought, \"Is this that really slippery\nshiiiiiiiiiiii!!!!!!!!!\" Happy to be alive, he showed the rest of us the\nline.\"</p>\n<p>The unofficial solo speed record was set on 15 Sep 2012 by Michelle\nNilles, when she descended both Upper and Lower Jump canyon together\n(aka 'integrale'), taking 6h45m car-to-car.</p>\n<h2 id=\"references\">References</h2>\n<references/>\n<aside id=\"footnotes\" class=\"footnotes footnotes-end-of-document\"\nrole=\"doc-endnotes\">\n<hr />\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn1\"><a\nhref=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/583118321723884/permalink/1085494468152931/\">https://www.facebook.com/groups/583118321723884/permalink/1085494468152931/</a><a\nhref=\"#fnref1\" class=\"footnote-back\" role=\"doc-backlink\">↩︎</a></li>\n<li id=\"fn2\"><a\nhref=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/583118321723884/permalink/1073018076067237/\">https://www.facebook.com/groups/583118321723884/permalink/1073018076067237/</a><a\nhref=\"#fnref2\" class=\"footnote-back\" role=\"doc-backlink\">↩︎</a></li>\n</ol>\n</aside>\n",
