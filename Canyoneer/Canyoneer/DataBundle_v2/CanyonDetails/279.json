The first is to\njust continue on down the canyon to the intersection with Halls Creek.\nHowever this is likely to involve some heavy bushwhacking. The better\noption is to climb out canyon left shortly after the last rappel\n(Approx. 150 yards). As you head down canyon keep an eye on canyon left\nfor an area that has some fallen trees and is covered in vines (Oct\n2015). This is really the first place you can easily climb out of the\ncanyon on this side. There is a short climb here that may need to be\nspotted (about 8 feet). Scramble up (North) to the ridge and then down\ndiagonally heading back to Halls Creek. (Original info for the shortcut\nexit provided by Taylor Atwood.)</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><img src=\"rwl_en.png\" title=\"rwl_en.png\" alt=\"rwl_en.png\" /><a\nhref=\"http://bluugnome.com/cyn_route/halls-creek/halls-creek_smiling-cricket/halls-creek_smiling-cricket.aspx\">BluuGnome.com</a>\n: Smiling Cricket Canyon</li>\n<li><img src=\"rwl_en.png\" title=\"rwl_en.png\" alt=\"rwl_en.png\" /><a\nhref=\"http://ropewiki.com/User:Super_Amazing_Map?id=Poe_Canyon__-_Lake_Powell_Area\">Super\nAmazing Map</a> : Poe Canyon (aka Smiling Cricket)</li>\n<li><img src=\"rwl_en.png\" title=\"rwl_en.png\" alt=\"rwl_en.png\" /><a\nhref=\"http://climb-utah.com/Capitol/poe.htm\">Climb-Utah.com</a> : Poe\nCanyon</li>\n<li><img src=\"rwl_en.png\" title=\"rwl_en.png\" alt=\"rwl_en.png\" /><a\nhref=\"http://canyoncollective.com/betabase/poe.95\">CanyonCollective.com</a>\n: Poe</li>\n<li><img src=\"rwl_en.png\" title=\"rwl_en.png\" alt=\"rwl_en.png\" /><a\nhref=\"http://roadtripryan.com/go/t/utah/capitol-reef/smiling-cricket\">RoadTripRyan.com</a>\n: Smiling Cricket Canyon (Poe Canyon)</li>\n<li><img src=\"rwl_en.png\" title=\"rwl_en.png\" alt=\"rwl_en.png\" /><a\nhref=\"http://summitpost.org/smiling-cricket/448554\">SummitPost.org</a> :\nSmiling Cricket</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a\nhref=\"https://www.facebook.com/pat.winstanley.7/media_set?set=a.1091665230892173.1073742077.100001461198708&amp;type=3\">https://www.facebook.com/pat.winstanley.7/media_set?set=a.1091665230892173.1073742077.100001461198708&amp;type=3</a></li>\n<li><img src=\"rwl_en.png\" title=\"rwl_en.png\" alt=\"rwl_en.png\" /><a\nhref=\"http://candition.com/canyons/poe-canyon-aka-smiling-cricket\">Candition.com</a>\n: RWID:279</li>\n<li><img src=\"rwl_en.png\" title=\"rwl_en.png\" alt=\"rwl_en.png\" /><a\nhref=\"http://6ixgun.com/journal/poe-waterpocket-fold\">Mark Kilian's\nAdventures</a> : Poe - Waterpocket Fold</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n",

To make the potshots of value they have to be thrown about 45 feet over the pit and beyond the patio. Mother nature bumps the level of difficulty up by giving you no good place to stand when tossing the potshots. You will need to stem up in a V slot about 6 feet to get a good throwing angle making for a very awkward stance. Mother nature bumps up the difficulty level once again by giving you a very narrow window to aim at by placing the canyons walls in the way.
