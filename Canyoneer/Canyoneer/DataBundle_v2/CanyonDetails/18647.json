little scruffy-looking but but soon develops into a nice canyon with lots of bedrock and interesting pothole pools before culminating in it's precipitous drop into Long canyon and the Arroyo Seco. The final 3 rappels are perhaps the best and most interesting portion of the canyon. Dropping in from the side drainage the brush clears up a bit once it meets the main fork.
