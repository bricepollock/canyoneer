  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>Surprisingly good canyon that is useful as an access point for\npackrafting on the Colorado below Glen Canyon Dam. Has a couple of\npotholes that may be semi-keepers if they are completely scoured out,\nnothing was an issue at the time of our descent. Has lots of junk\nvehicles at the head and a fair bit of trash throughout. Toggle device\nis useful on many rappels due to set back anchor points.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>Park at the Walmart in Page. Follow access road on the North side of\nthe Walmart (between Walmart and the Autozone). Split off into the\ndrainage when logical. There is an established social trail. First\nseveral (3) drops are bypassed on the down canyon right.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>R1: Fiddle tree on DCR. (65')</li>\n<li>R2: Sandtrap. (110')</li>\n<li>R3: Single bolt on DCL. (50')</li>\n<li>R4: Single bolt on DCL (partially hidden under edge). Three stage.\n(160')</li>\n<li>Partner assisted down climb.</li>\n<li>R5: Single bolt on DCL.

It technically\nserves as the boundary between Federal access/homeland security, Glen\nCanyon Rec, and the City of Page.\"</p>\n<p>Do not access from the federally controlled tunnel access road.</p>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><img src=\"rwl_en.png\" title=\"rwl_en.png\" alt=\"rwl_en.png\" /><a\nhref=\"http://ropewiki.com/User:Super_Amazing_Map?id=Junkyard_Canyon_-_Arizona\">Super\nAmazing Map</a> : Junkyard Canyon</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n<p>Originally explored by Clint Poole and Mike Whipple.</p>\n<p>Beta updated June 2023.</p>\n",
