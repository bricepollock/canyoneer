  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>A fun, beautiful canyon with excellent access, a bunch of\naesthetically-pleasing waterfalls, and a short section of narrows.\nDestined to become a classic in the Dark Divide Area. Dark Creek\ngenerally takes about half a day to run. With an early start, combine\nDark with nearby East Canyon Creek or Prairie Creek for a full day of\ncanyoning.</p>\n<p>The four mandatory rappels are all of excellent quality giving the\nrappeller the option to go in the flow. The other six drops provide some\nof the best downclimbs in WA, with nice chunky handholds and steps from\nthe blocky Basalt walls. A rare opportunity to downclimb in the flow\nwith very minimal consequences with pools at the bottom.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Checkpoint is at R1 or where the trail crosses the creek. Both of\nthose spots require a lot of time and energy to check the flow. You can\nalso check just north of the approach parking area, you have to walk\nthrough the trees and look across the river to see Dark Creek. There are\nnot any flow pictures for this location. If the water looks and sounds\nhigh, its going to be high. Moderate flow is going to be more of a soft\ngentle creek flow.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Watershed: 4.15mi^2. Predominantly north-facing. Highest areas of\nthe watershed are around 4700-5300ft high.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>Park at the unsigned trailhead on FR-23. The road here was previously\nwashed out, but was repaired in 2018. There's now a wide area in the\nroad with room for 4-5 vehicles. Note the large berm (aka dam-like\nconstruction of logs and chains) put in to keep the road from getting\nwashed out again in winter floods. Ford the creek to the trail on the\nfar side (easily identified by a concrete ramp) and follow it. After\nabout 1.3mi, the trail crosses Dark Creek; this is a good place to check\nthe flow. Continue upwards 0.6mi to a junction around 3500ft (approx.\nUTM 10N 595991mE 5128029mN) just past Dark's minor western tributary.\nFollow the trail southwest and keep going to about UTM 10N 596295mE\n5127734mN. Leave the trail and thrash northeast down a shallow drainage\nto Dark Creek. Off-trail section takes ~5min. Don't cut thrash over\nearly or you'll miss some nice canyon.</p>\n<p>Other notes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Older USGS maps depict the trail looping just above Dark Creek\nFalls. It doesn't exist. See ropewiki map for actual trail\nlocation.</li>\n<li>This is a popular motorcycle use trail. Give way to riders. Getting\nan early start in the morning might be a good way to avoid them on the\napproach.</li>\n<li>It might be possible to shuttle up using FR 2325, although this\noption has not been explored as of 2019.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>Head downstream through a nice area of bedrock.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>R1: 8ft. Rappel from tree DCR or downclimb DCL.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Follow the bedrock around a corner and downclimb past several\ncascades.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>R2: 90ft from tree DCL. Water cascades down a chute from DCL to DCR\nentering a wonderful pool in the narrows below. R3 is at the pool's\nexit.</li>\n<li>R3: 25ft from log DCR or downclimb.</li>\n<li>R4: 15ft. Big logjam atop the falls. Rappel from log, or climb over\nthe logs (awkward) for a downclimb DCL.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Downclimb a series of short drops. In high flow, a rappel might be\nrecommended on some of these.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>R5: 25ft from log creek center, or downclimb DCR.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The next three rappels come rapid-fire and are collectively known as\n\"Dark Creek Falls.\" If the flow proves too high, it's possible to escape\nDCL above R6.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>R6: 85ft. Anchor on a tree DCL. A smaller tributary enters DCL\nhere.</li>\n<li>R7: 65ft. As of 2022, this is a cairn anchor, which will likely need\nto be rebuilt every year. An old rotten log spans above the top of the\nrappel, but it is marginal and cannot be backed up. A cairn anchor is a\nmore reliable solution. <font color=\"red\">Beware a deep hanging pothole\npartway down the pitch, on DCL (rappeller's right side of the falls).\nIt's fun to rappel in when the flow is low, but could be a trap in high\nwater conditions. </font> The pothole is not visible from above.</li>\n<li>R8: 110ft from two bolts DCL. Recommend extending the pull side\nahead of time for an easier pull at the bottom. Falls is a large funnel\ngoing into a dark grotto (aka \"The Dark Room\") and exits through a\nnarrow slot. This area could be dangerous in high flow; there may be a\nhydraulic present at the bottom. In high water conditions, it may be\nwiser to rappel from a tree far DCR to avoid the chamber.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Walk out through a short narrows and bypass a logjam DCR (easier than\nit looks).</p>\n<ul>\n<li>R9: Two tier falls: 20ft, a bit of a horizontal chute, then another\n10ft tier. The first tier is usually anchored by a tree DCL. The second\ntier can be downclimbed or jumped.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>Walk downstream 5min to reach the trail. Follow it back to your car.\nDeclare victory.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<p>None.</p>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<p><a\nhref=\"http://www.oregonhikers.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=10&amp;t=25790\">Zach\nForsyth - Trip Report</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n",
