While it's very pretty, it's not really a canyoneering route. It's a series of five cascades, four of which can be rappelled, and all of which can easily be bypassed by good trails. \n<\/p><p>Local guides occasionally bring tourists here to rappel. It never slots up, and you upclimb nearly the entire route to get to the start, so by the time you get your rope out, you've already seen and swam in the entire route.\n<\/p><p>As of 2022, there are some issues with locals saying swimming is not allowed (locals throw their trash and sewage in the Río Camu where they live. Instead of stopping littering and illegal sewage discharge, they take their drinking water from the La Rejoya waterfalls and claim swimming in the falls is not allowed unless you pay a fee).\n<\/p><p>Canyoneers looking for routes in the Dominican Republic will inevitably hear about La Rejoya, so this page provides all the information needed.\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Park at the GPS spot. Ask a local if parking is OK. They will almost always say yes and direct you to the trail, not asking for any money.\n<\/p><p>From the parking area, walk up to the small group of houses surrounded by plenty of trash and animal feces. Locals seem to always be inside watching TV or listening to music here.\n<\/p><p>The road ends and becomes a trail. Follow the trail along the Río Camu for 10-15 minutes. The trail will turn left (south) when it intersects with La Rejoya stream. Follow this trail, and soon you can cross La Rejoya stream via some dry rocks.\n<\/p><p>Follow La Rejoya upstream using the trail on the right. Before long, you'll have to again cross La Rejoya to the opposite side. If somehow you reach a locked gate on the west bank, turn around, retreat maybe 100 meters, and take the very obvious crossing.\n<\/p><p>Now you're on the main trail. You'll soon see tubing. Follow the tubing upstream for at least 30 minutes, with multiple ankle-deep stream crossings. The GPS track should help somewhat. There are no steep parts or bushwhacking.\n<\/p><p>When you get to the base of the first big waterfall you see (the fifth waterfall on the descent), go back downstream 1-2 minutes, and climb up the trail on the east bank (right side looking downcanyon). There is a trail here, again very obvious. Follow it up, and you'll soon encounter a sketchy upclimb on slippery rocks that many will want to have a handline for. First person up can rig a handline on some roots. A fall here would result in injury, hence the R- rating for this canyon.\n<\/p>\n<style data-mw-deduplicate=\"TemplateStyles:r1062633282\">@media all and (max-width:720px){.mw-parser-output .content .thumb>div:not(.thumbinner){display:flex;justify-content:center;flex-wrap:wrap;align-content:flex-start;flex-direction:column}}body.skin-vector .mw-parser-output div.thumb>div:not(.thumbinner){font-size:94%;text-align:center;overflow:hidden;min-width:100px}body.skin-minerva .mw-parser-output div.thumb>div:not(.thumbinner){margin:0 auto;max-width:100%!important}<\/style> \n<div class=\"thumb tright\">\n<div style=\"display:table;\">\n<span class=\"mw-default-size\" typeof=\"mw:Error mw:File\/Frameless\">\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>After the upclimb, continue following the trail along the cliffs above the stream.

This village is absolutely filled with trash, and locals discharge their sewage into the river, called Río Camu. Because of this ignorance, locals cannot drink from the Río Camu.
