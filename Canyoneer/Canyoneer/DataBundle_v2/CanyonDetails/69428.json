  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>La Rejoya Canyon seems to be well known among the five or so active\ncanyoneers in the Dominican Republic. While it's very pretty, it's not\nreally a canyoneering route. It's a series of five cascades, four of\nwhich can be rappelled, and all of which can easily be bypassed by good\ntrails.</p>\n<p>Local guides occasionally bring tourists here to rappel. It never\nslots up, and you upclimb nearly the entire route to get to the start,\nso by the time you get your rope out, you've already seen and swam in\nthe entire route.</p>\n<p>As of 2022, there are some issues with locals saying swimming is not\nallowed (locals throw their trash and sewage in the Río Camu where they\nlive. Instead of stopping littering and illegal sewage discharge, they\ntake their drinking water from the La Rejoya waterfalls and claim\nswimming in the falls is not allowed unless you pay a fee).</p>\n<p>Canyoneers looking for routes in the Dominican Republic will\ninevitably hear about La Rejoya, so this page provides all the\ninformation needed.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>Park at the GPS spot. Ask a local if parking is OK. They will almost\nalways say yes and direct you to the trail, not asking for any\nmoney.</p>\n<p>From the parking area, walk up to the small group of houses\nsurrounded by plenty of trash and animal feces. Locals seem to always be\ninside watching TV or listening to music here.</p>\n<p>The road ends and becomes a trail. Follow the trail along the Río\nCamu for 10-15 minutes. The trail will turn left (south) when it\nintersects with La Rejoya stream. Follow this trail, and soon you can\ncross La Rejoya stream via some dry rocks.</p>\n<p>Follow La Rejoya upstream using the trail on the right. Before long,\nyou'll have to again cross La Rejoya to the opposite side. If somehow\nyou reach a locked gate on the west bank, turn around, retreat maybe 100\nmeters, and take the very obvious crossing.</p>\n<p>Now you're on the main trail. You'll soon see tubing. Follow the\ntubing upstream for at least 30 minutes, with multiple ankle-deep stream\ncrossings. The GPS track should help somewhat. There are no steep parts\nor bushwhacking.</p>\n<p>When you get to the base of the first big waterfall you see (the\nfifth waterfall on the descent), go back downstream 1-2 minutes, and\nclimb up the trail on the east bank (right side looking downcanyon).\nThere is a trail here, again very obvious. Follow it up, and you'll soon\nencounter a sketchy upclimb on slippery rocks that many will want to\nhave a handline for. First person up can rig a handline on some roots. A\nfall here would result in injury, hence the R- rating for this\ncanyon.</p>\n<p>After the upclimb, continue following the trail along the cliffs\nabove the stream. Don't take the steep descent back to the stream; stay\non a trail that more gradually descends.</p>\n<p>You'll the arrive at another waterfall (the fourth waterfall on the\ndescent). Suit up here, and upclimb the easy upper part of this\nfalls.</p>\n<p>Keep going upstream. Upclimb the third waterfall, which is smaller,\nthen bypass the second waterfall on a good trail on the right. You can\nthen continue to the top of the first waterfall, called Cascada La\nRejoya, via another decent trail on the right (west) side. You've arrive\nat the start of the route.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>All anchors are natural anchors. As of January 2022, there are no\nexisting anchors, so you'll need to bring your own webbing and rapides.\nThere are plenty of trees to anchor off of. You'll want at least a\nshorty wetsuit.</p>\n<p>Rappel 1 is around 40 meters down the magnificent Cascada La\nRejoya.</p>\n<p>Rappel 2 is Around 20 meters down the second falls.</p>\n<p>The third falls, which you've already upclimbed, are a simple\ndownclimb. The pool is shallow, and probably not suitable for\njumping.</p>\n<p>The fourth falls can be rappeled, or likely jumped. The rappel is\naround 16 meters. There's a nice tree to anchor off of on the left\ndowncanyon side.</p>\n<p>After the third rappel is a pumping structure with 'No Swimming'\nsigns. Then the fifth falls, with a rappel around 30 meters. The\ncanyoneering route then ends.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>Walk back to your car the way you came.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<p>More and more tourists are starting to come to these falls. Numbers\nare still low, maybe 1-2 dozen people a day max, but locals are deciding\nhow to best capitalize on their resource. It seems inevitable that they\nwill soon charge money.</p>\n<p>There is a tiny local village downstream of the falls, where the\nparking spot is. This village is absolutely filled with trash, and\nlocals discharge their sewage into the river, called Río Camu. Because\nof this ignorance, locals cannot drink from the Río Camu. Instead, they\ntake their drinking water from the waterfalls of La Rejoya, via a\npumping station and a long pipeline.</p>\n<p>Locals say swimming is not allowed in the La Rejoya waterfalls, as it\nwill contaminate their drinking water. They also say that only after 'un\nimpuesto' (a tax/fee) is paid made you swim.</p>\n<p>Locals try to follow every person up to the falls, even though\nthere's no sign indicating they must guide you. If you pay a local\n(bribe?) they will let you swim, and not tell anyone. There are a few\ncanyoning tours that visit the falls once or twice a month and obviously\nswim. It's unknown if they are bribing, or if there is some rule\nallowing guided groups. Regardless, there are are cattle and homes\nupstream that surely put some contamination into the water!</p>\n<p>If going, it's probably best to hike fast and not pay locals. Who\nknows what the rules are, if there even are any - this is the Dominican\nRepublic, after all.</p>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<p><a\nhref=\"https://www.lukaseddy.com/canyons-of-the-dominican-republic\">https://www.lukaseddy.com/canyons-of-the-dominican-republic</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n<p>Locals have known of these waterfalls, and certainly hiked up to\nthem, for centuries. The middle section has a pump house. It's unknown\nwho decided to rappel the falls first.</p>\n",
