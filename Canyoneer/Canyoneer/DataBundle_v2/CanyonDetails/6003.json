  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>Hardy Falls and Rodney Falls (aka Pool of Winds) are the main\nattractions on this creek.</p>\n<p>Hardy Creek's flow changes substantially with the season. In full\nspate, water will be literally blasting out of the Pool of the Winds,\nwhereas in late summer the flow subsides and becomes beginner-friendly.\nThis area is very popular with the general public, so please avoid\nleaving visible anchors.</p>\n<p>Watershed: 2.4mi^2.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>Across from the parking area for Beacon Rock drive up and park at the\nLower Picnic area. This is the standard trailhead for Hamilton Mountain,\na popular hike. A Washington State Discovery Pass is required to park\nhere.</p>\n<p>From the parking area, follow the trail about 1mi to reach Hardy\nCreek. (Just before reaching the creek, note a spur trail on the right\nleading down to anovergrown viewing platform of Hardy Falls. This will\nbe your exit.) At the creek a very short side-trail leads to a\nmetal-railed viewing platform allowing you to peek at the Pool of the\nWinds. The main trail descends a short distance to a large footbridge.\nThis is a good opportunity to check flow rate. On the far side, follow\nthe trail upwards until you reach an obvious signed junction. Go left\nand follow the new trail north along the east side of Hardy Creek for a\nfew hundred yards until you locate a user trail dropping into the\ndrainage. It's a bit steep, but doable.</p>\n<p>Head downstream, passing through a boulder jam (easiest way to\nscramble through seemed to be DCR), to R1. Takes about 5min.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>Please do not leave fixed anchors below R1 as this is a high tourist\narea.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>R1:</strong> <em>Rodney Falls</em> 35ft from tree DCR. This\ndrops into a pool/alcove called <em>Pool of the Winds</em>. Watch for a\nbig old growth log leaning vertically against the falls. In low water,\nit's possible to rappel down behind it. Do not jump - there's an\nenormous boulder hidden under the surface. Pool of the Winds is also a\npopular swimming hole in summer; don't throw your rope down on\nanyone.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The creek exits the pool, through a 3ft wide crack. Use caution on\nexiting as another drop (adjacent to the viewing platform) comes\nimmediately.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>R2:</strong> ~50ft from one of the metal posts of the\nviewing platform, then downclimb the rest of the way. It's fun to follow\nthe watercourse, but beware potential for a nasty pendulum swing when\nthe creek changes direction.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Downclimb a short drop under the footbridge. Head downstream about\n5min.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>R3:</strong> <em>Hardy Falls</em> 90ft from cluster of trees\ncreek center. You'll be walking right past this place on the exit, so\npulling your rope from below is optional.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>From the bottom of Hardy Falls, continue downstream a short distance\nand, when feasible, thrash/scramble your way up &amp; out DCL on the\neast side of the creek. Make your way up steep slopes until you reach a\nbench (old trail location?) that leads back down to Hardy Creek just\nabove R3. Cross the creek, retrieve your rope, and make your way up the\nwest side to reach the old viewing platform. Return the way you came to\nthe trailhead.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<p>A Washington State Discovery Pass is required to park at Beacon Rock\nState Park.</p>\n<p>Rodney Falls is an extremely popular hike. Be aware: unlike other\nparts of the country, canyoning is not widely known or recognized in the\nPacific NW. Individuals climbing, rappelling, or slack-lining around\nsuch \"show waterfalls\" are more likely to garner negative reactions from\nthe general public at large. Negative reactions can lead to complaints\nand more rules by the local authorities. Locals suggest descending this\ncreek when the number of hikers will be low - e.g. early in the morning\nor on weekdays. Please be scrupulous about following a Leave-No-Trace\nethic. Leaving brightly colored anchors can annoy waterfall\nphotographers, irk land managers, and may encourage the inexperienced /\nunprepared to attempt to follow you.</p>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a\nhref=\"http://trails.gorgefriends.org/trail/hardy-falls-rodney-falls-pool-of-winds/\">http://trails.gorgefriends.org/trail/hardy-falls-rodney-falls-pool-of-winds/</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a\nhref=\"http://parks.state.wa.us/474/Beacon-Rock\">http://parks.state.wa.us/474/Beacon-Rock</a>*</li>\n<li><a\nhref=\"http://parks.state.wa.us/DocumentCenter/Home/View/1840\">http://parks.state.wa.us/DocumentCenter/Home/View/1840</a>*</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n<p>This creek was probably first descended by Portland locals.</p>\n<h2 id=\"further_explorations\">Further Explorations</h2>\n<p>There might be another short falls on the creek around 1400'\nelevation but this has not been confirmed.</p>\n",
