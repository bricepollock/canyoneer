{"url":"https:\/\/ropewiki.com\/Hardy_Creek","months":["Jul","Aug","Jun"],"riskRating":null,"description":"<div class=\"mw-content-ltr mw-parser-output\" lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><p>Hardy Falls and Rodney Falls (aka Pool of Winds) are the main attractions on this creek.\n<\/p><p>Hardy Creek's flow changes substantially with the season.  In full spate, water will be literally blasting out of the Pool of the Winds, whereas in late summer the flow subsides and becomes beginner-friendly.  This area is very popular with the general public, so please avoid leaving visible anchors.\n<\/p><p>Watershed: 2.4mi^2.\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Across from the parking area for Beacon Rock drive up and park at the Lower Picnic area.  This is the standard trailhead for Hamilton Mountain, a popular hike.  A Washington State Discovery Pass is required to park here.\n<\/p><p>From the parking area, follow the trail about 1mi to reach Hardy Creek.  (Just before reaching the creek, note a spur trail on the right leading down to anovergrown viewing platform of Hardy Falls. This will be your exit.)  At the creek a very short side-trail leads to a metal-railed viewing platform allowing you to peek at the Pool of the Winds.  The main trail descends a short distance to a large footbridge.  This is a good opportunity to check flow rate. On the far side, follow the trail upwards until you reach an obvious signed junction.  Go left and follow the new trail north along the east side of Hardy Creek for a few hundred yards until you locate a user trail dropping into the drainage. It's a bit steep, but doable. \n<\/p><p>Head downstream, passing through a boulder jam (easiest way to scramble through seemed to be DCR), to R1. Takes about 5min.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Please do not leave fixed anchors below R1 as this is a high tourist area.\n<\/p>\n<ul><li><b>R1:<\/b> <i>Rodney Falls<\/i> 35ft from tree DCR. This drops into a pool\/alcove called <i>Pool of the Winds<\/i>. Watch for a big old growth log leaning vertically against the falls. In low water, it's possible to rappel down behind it. Do not jump - there's an enormous boulder hidden under the surface. Pool of the Winds is also a popular swimming hole in summer;  don't throw your rope down on anyone.<\/li><\/ul>\n<p>The creek exits the pool, through a 3ft wide crack.  Use caution on exiting as another drop (adjacent to the viewing platform) comes immediately.\n<\/p>\n<ul><li><b>R2:<\/b> ~50ft from one of the metal posts of the viewing platform, then downclimb the rest of the way. It's fun to follow the watercourse, but beware potential for a nasty pendulum swing when the creek changes direction.<\/li><\/ul>\n<ul><li>Downclimb a short drop under the footbridge. Head downstream about 5min.<\/li><\/ul>\n<ul><li><b>R3:<\/b> <i>Hardy Falls<\/i> 90ft from cluster of trees creek center. You'll be walking right past this place on the exit, so pulling your rope from below is optional.<\/li><\/ul>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>From the bottom of Hardy Falls, continue downstream a short distance and, when feasible, thrash\/scramble your way up &amp; out DCL on the east side of the creek.  Make your way up steep slopes until you reach a bench (old trail location?) that leads back down to Hardy Creek just above R3.  Cross the creek, retrieve your rope, and make your way up the west side to reach the old viewing platform.  Return the way you came to the trailhead.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Red_tape\">Red tape<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>A Washington State Discovery Pass is required to park at Beacon Rock State Park.\n<\/p><p>Rodney Falls is an extremely popular hike. Be aware:  unlike other parts of the country, canyoning is not widely known or recognized in the Pacific NW.  Individuals climbing, rappelling, or slack-lining around such \"show waterfalls\" are more likely to garner negative reactions from the general public at large. Negative reactions can lead to complaints and more rules by the local authorities.  Locals suggest descending this creek when the number of hikers will be low - e.g. early in the morning or on weekdays.  Please be scrupulous about following a Leave-No-Trace ethic.  Leaving brightly colored anchors can annoy waterfall photographers, irk land managers, and may encourage the inexperienced \/ unprepared to attempt to follow you.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading
