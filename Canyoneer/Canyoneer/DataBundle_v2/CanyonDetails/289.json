Optional 30’ rappel to get off the caprock to the top bench. Optional rappel in top finger 25’. Both can be bypassed going left. Can walk down slickrock in between the tiny top forks. Two hand lines or rappels for 25’. Some optional stemming available. Below the confluence with Shimrock a beautiful dark walk through a Bombay. Rockfall in the narrow section before the confluence with Right Fork must be up climbed. Skinny people may be able to fit through rabbit holes.
