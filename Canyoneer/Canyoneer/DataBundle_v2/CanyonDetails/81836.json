Perfect to combine with Hüttenwistobel when everything else has too much water (Hüttenwistobel in the morning, Schreustobel in the afternoon). Don't trust the water level you can see coming out from the canyon, due to sources, the canyon only has about 1\/5 of the water level you can see down the road. Thus, your best reference would be Hüttenwistobel, if that one looks almost dry already, then Schreustobel is almost dry too, so better go for Panäratobel, Chrüzbach or Parlitobel in this case.\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Go up the closest path south of the canyon until a height of about 1410m.
