  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>A nice descent immediately after heavy rains. Perfect to combine with\nHüttenwistobel when everything else has too much water (Hüttenwistobel\nin the morning, Schreustobel in the afternoon). Don't trust the water\nlevel you can see coming out from the canyon, due to sources, the canyon\nonly has about 1/5 of the water level you can see down the road. Thus,\nyour best reference would be Hüttenwistobel, if that one looks almost\ndry already, then Schreustobel is almost dry too, so better go for\nPanäratobel, Chrüzbach or Parlitobel in this case.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>Go up the closest path south of the canyon until a height of about\n1410m. There the map shows that there is no more path, but in reality\nthere is, it will lead you immediately to the start of the canyon.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>Nice pitches, sometimes you need to do 2 Waterfalls in one. A few\nsafety exits on the way down.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>Easy, walk down the riverbed.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n"
