  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>In a remote section of the Baker River region of the North Cascades\nlies a beautiful canyon filled with interesting aquatic features.\nMultiple jumps, slides, pool and corridor swims fill a narrow gorge,\ndecorated by smoothly carved walls in a variety of volcanic bedrock\ntypes. A dense rainforest canopy obscures the upper part of the canyon,\nwhile the pools of the lower section are open to generous amounts of\nsun.</p>\n<p>The Thunder Creek catchment basin is quite large, so the flow is\ntypically too high / dangerous most of the year. The best time to run\nthis canyon is typically August and September.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>The approach is along a state DNR road which accesses actively logged\ntimberland. At one point this road used to get more through traffic, and\nit is labeled on most maps as the 'Baker River Road'. However the old\nroad bridge over the canyon has long ago collapsed. It is gated from\nboth the north and the south side. Its lack of regular travelers means\nthat wildlife are more likely to be spotted -- possible that more cougar\nprowl this area now than people.</p>\n<p>Take the Baker Lake highway to the Baker Lake Dam. After passing a\ncampground and crossing the dam, park to the side near the large gate.\nSpecial note: the mosquitoes on in this area are heinous in the summer\nmonths. Bug spray and/or long sleeves/pants are highly recommended for\nthe approach and exit.</p>\n<p>Hike south for about 3.5 miles. This road is partially paved and\ntaking bikes would certainly make the trip shorter and would mitigate\nthe mosquitoes. The road ends at the creek right at the point the\nbedrock canyon begins. It is possible to carefully scramble on large\nrocks to skirt around the first pool. Just below here, the remains of\nthe old bridge can be seen, and the start of the committing section of\ncanyon.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p><strong>DCR</strong> = Down Canyon Right</p>\n<p><strong>DCL</strong> = Down Canyon Left</p>\n<p>Special notes: Always have one person check pool depth before\njumping. This canyon is slippery. Be very cautious on the various\ndownclimbs. Scrambles and/or partner assists may be required to reach\nanchors that have been placed above the high water line.</p>\n<p>After suiting up, head down the creek about 100yds. The creek turns\nsharply to the left. This sequence can be bypassed DCL. This first short\nfalls is a good place to get waterflow reference. Continue down and\nclimb around the rocks on CR to a ledge. This is the first jump.</p>\n<p>J1 DCR: 15' jump. Check the flow and hydraulics here. If the flow is\ntoo raucous, consider bailing or running the lower section of the canyon\nonly, which is not as committing.</p>\n<p>R1 DCR: 12' from a single bolt. A scramble is required to reach this\nanchor. In high flow, the current can be strong here. This short drop\nhas been jumped. In lower flows this can be downclimbed.</p>\n<p>R2 DCR: 40' from a bolted anchor. A scramble/partner assist may be\nrequired to reach this anchor. Rappel the entire way or stop at the\nledge and jump DCL.</p>\n<p>J2 DCL: 22' jump from ledge into a large pool. No anchor.</p>\n<p><em>Midpoint: The canyon opens up here briefly and allows access on\nboth sides. Note this spot, it is one potential option for the\nexit.</em></p>\n<p>J3 DCL: 15' jump into deep undercut pool. You must jump out far to\nclear a rock ledge below.</p>\n<p>R3 DCL: 30' from a single bolt. A partner assist may be needed to\nreach this anchor.</p>\n<p>J4: 15' jump into a narrow slot leading into large pool. This short\ndrop has been done as a slide, but as of summer 2020, a large log is\nresting in the watercourse preventing the slide. The canyon opens up\nhere and this section can be bypassed completely. Bypass the canyon DCL\nin the bushes right above the canyon. Not recommended to jump in the\npools between J4 and J5 because the water is pushy and there's no good\nway out besides getting pushed over the falls.</p>\n<p>J5 DCL: 20' jump from a ledge into a very deep pool. This pool is\nvery cool to dive down and check out with a mask.</p>\n<p>J6: 8' jump into final pool. If the flow is too strong to safely\napproach the lip, simply exit the canyon to the left.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>Exit Option 1: Walk down the river gravels until the river curves to\nthe left. Climb up the embankment on river right. There is a bit of\nbuswhacking at the start but it gets better as you ascend the hillside.\nScramble up through the forest 15-20 minutes, skirting the edge of an\nold landslide on your right. After topping out, you'll find a very old\nroad. Turn LEFT, not right, and walk about 500' until the road curves to\nthe right and makes a U-turn. The old road becomes more open here.\nFollow this road back to the main road. This is generally the preferred\nexit option.</p>\n<p>Exit Option 2: From the broad river gravels, exit canyon left. Ascend\ninto the old growth forest and follow the rim of the canyon on south\nside back to the midpoint. There is no trail, so this is a bushwhack.\nHowever this spot (PSE land) has not been logged, which has kept the\nunderbrush to mostly sword fern, making for mostly pleasant going. After\nreaching the midpoint, cross the stream to the north side, and head\nuphill to regain the approach road. The brush will be thick salmonberry\nat first, but it then relents to sword fern in a deciduous canopy.\nBeware of nettles. Approaching the top by the road, it can get quite\nsteep and there is some loose scree to scramble past. Return via road.\nBased on prior groups, this exit is about 10-15 minutes faster than Exit\nOption 3.</p>\n<p>Exit Option 3: Walk down the river gravels until the river curves to\nthe left. Climb up the embankment and scramble up through the forest\n20-30 minutes. Scramble through the mix of mature forest, ferns, and\ndevils club up to the closest road. The spur road returns to the main\ngravel road, however, unfortunately as you travel North you will\ndiscover that it does not connect to the road you walked in on. If you\nreached the terminus of the main North/South gravel road you've gone to\nfar. There is a relatively well worn trail that connects the\nnow-discontinuous road. In Aug 2020 it's start was difficult to find,\nhowever, we later encountered it by noticing flagging tape in the nearby\ntrees.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<p>Road is gated, passing through land owned by mix of State DNR, PSE\nutility, and private timberlands. It is open for recreational non\nmotorized access.</p>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<p><a\nhref=\"https://youtu.be/0tk9g1F-2t4\">https://youtu.be/0tk9g1F-2t4</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n<p>The canyon was descended by Kevin Steffa, Jake Huddleston, and Pt\nChoate on Sept 9, 2018. Kevin Steffa and Tiffanie Lin scouted Thundercat\non an oddly rainy day on Aug 11, 2018.</p>\n",
