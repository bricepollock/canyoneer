{"months":["Aug","Sep"],"riskRating":null,"longitude":-121.6948,"id":53349,"name":"Thunder Creek (North Cascades)","waterRating":"C2","permit":"No","description":"<div class=\"mw-content-ltr mw-parser-output\" lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><p>In a remote section of the Baker River region of the North Cascades lies a beautiful canyon filled with interesting aquatic features. Multiple jumps, slides, pool and corridor swims fill a narrow gorge, decorated by smoothly carved walls in a variety of volcanic bedrock types. A dense rainforest canopy obscures the upper part of the canyon, while the pools of the lower section are open to generous amounts of sun.\n<\/p><p>The Thunder Creek catchment basin is quite large, so the flow is typically too high \/ dangerous most of the year. The best time to run this canyon is typically August and September.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>The approach is along a state DNR road which accesses actively logged timberland. At one point this road used to get more through traffic, and it is labeled on most maps as the 'Baker River Road'. However the old road bridge over the canyon has long ago collapsed. It is gated from both the north and the south side. Its lack of regular travelers means that wildlife are more likely to be spotted -- possible that more cougar prowl this area now than people.\n<\/p><p>Take the Baker Lake highway to the Baker Lake Dam. After passing a campground and crossing the dam, park to the side near the large gate. Special note: the mosquitoes on in this area are heinous in the summer months. Bug spray and\/or long sleeves\/pants are highly recommended for the approach and exit.\n<\/p><p>Hike south for about 3.5 miles. This road is partially paved and taking bikes would certainly make the trip shorter and would mitigate the mosquitoes. The road ends at the creek right at the point the bedrock canyon begins. It is possible to carefully scramble on large rocks to skirt around the first pool. Just below here, the remains of the old bridge can be seen, and the start of the committing section of canyon.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p><b>DCR<\/b> = Down Canyon Right\n<\/p><p><b>DCL<\/b> = Down Canyon Left\n<\/p><p>Special notes: Always have one person check pool depth before jumping. This canyon is slippery. Be very cautious on the various downclimbs. Scrambles and\/or partner assists may be required to reach anchors that have been placed above the high water line.\n<\/p><p>After suiting up, head down the creek about 100yds. The creek turns sharply to the left. This sequence can be bypassed DCL. This first short falls is a good place to get waterflow reference. Continue down and climb around the rocks on CR to a ledge. This is the first jump.\n<\/p><p>J1 DCR: 15' jump. Check the flow and hydraulics here. If the flow is too raucous, consider bailing or running the lower section of the canyon only, which is not as committing.\n<\/p><p>R1 DCR: 12' from a single bolt. A scramble is required to reach this anchor. In high flow, the current can be strong here. This short drop has been jumped. In lower flows this can be downclimbed. \n<\/p><p>R2 DCR: 40' from a bolted anchor. A scramble\/partner assist may be required to reach this anchor. Rappel the entire way or stop at the ledge and jump DCL.\n<\/p><p>J2 DCL: 22' jump from ledge into a large pool. No anchor.  \n<\/p><p><i>Midpoint: The canyon opens up here briefly and allows access on both sides. Note this spot, it is one potential option for the exit.<\/i>\n<\/p><p>J3 DCL: 15' jump into deep undercut pool. You must jump out far to clear a rock ledge below.\n<\/p><p>R3 DCL: 30' from a single bolt. A partner assist may be needed to reach this anchor.\n<\/p><p>J4: 15' jump into a narrow slot leading into large pool. This short drop has been done as a slide, but as of summer 2020, a large log is resting in the watercourse preventing the slide. The canyon opens up here and this section can be bypassed completely. Bypass the canyon DCL in the bushes right above the canyon. Not recommended to jump in the pools between J4 and J5 because the water is pushy and there's no good way out besides getting pushed over the falls.  \n<\/p><p>J5 DCL: 20' jump from a ledge into a very deep pool. This pool is very cool to dive down and check out with a mask.\n<\/p><p>J6: 8' jump into final pool. If the flow is too strong to safely approach the lip, simply exit the canyon to the left.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Exit Option 1: Walk down the river gravels until the river curves to the left. Climb up the embankment on river right. There is a bit of buswhacking at the start but it gets better as you ascend the hillside. Scramble up through the forest 15-20 minutes, skirting the edge of an old landslide on your right. After topping out, you'll find a very old road. Turn LEFT, not right, and walk about 500' until the road curves to the right and makes a U-turn. The old road becomes more open here. Follow this road back to the main road. This is generally the preferred exit option.\n<\/p><p>Exit Option 2: From the broad river gravels, exit canyon left. Ascend into the old growth forest and follow the rim of the canyon on south side back to the midpoint. There is no trail, so this is a bushwhack. However this spot (PSE land) has not been logged, which has kept the underbrush to mostly sword fern, making for mostly pleasant going. After reaching the midpoint, cross the stream to the\n<\/p>\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nParsed by mw‐api‐ext.codfw.main‐6779cc57fc‐d9ptm\nCached time: 20240914192010\nCache expiry: 2592000\nReduced expiry: false\nComplications: []\nCPU time usage: 0.007 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.008 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 9\/1000000\nPost‐expand include size: 0\/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 0\/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 2\/100\nExpensive parser function count: 0\/500\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0\/20\nUnstrip post‐expand size: 0\/5000000 bytes\nNumber of Wikibase entities loaded: 0\/400\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%    0.000      1 -total\n-->\n<\/div><div class=\"mw-content-ltr mw-parser-output\" lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><pre>north side, and head uphill to regain the approach road. The brush will be thick salmonberry at first, but it then relents to sword fern in a deciduous canopy. Beware of nettles. Approaching the top by the road, it can get quite steep and there is some loose scree to scramble past. Return via road. Based on prior groups, this exit is about 10-15 minutes faster than Exit Option 3.\n<\/pre>\n<p>Exit Option 3: Walk down the river gravels until the river curves to the left. Climb up the embankment and scramble up through the forest 20-30 minutes.  Scramble through the mix of mature forest, ferns, and devils club up to the closest road.  The spur road returns to the main gravel road, however, unfortunately as you travel North you will discover that it does not connect to the road you walked in on.  If you reached the terminus of the main North\/South gravel road you've gone to far.  There is a relatively well worn trail that connects the now-discontinuous road.
