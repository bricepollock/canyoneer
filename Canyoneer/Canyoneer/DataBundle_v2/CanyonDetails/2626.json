There are 4  rappels depending on what you want to downclimb, with anchor challenges throughout.\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Drive up R39 and park at the turnout for 2N28, which is on the left\/west side of the road just a short distance after passing Morris Dam (the big fancy concrete one). Hike up the road a short distance and stay left, following a trail up the ridge past a water tank and to the top of another ridge. Hike south along the ridge and decide upon where you want to drop into the canyon. It is suggested that you hike down the spur north of the actual canyon, and drop in a short distance above the technical section. This is just before reaching the powerlines on the ridge.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>The usual San Gabriel challenges present themselves. Bushwhacking, poisonous plants, cacti and succulents with sharp pointy bits, snakes, and really crummy anchor options. This canyon rewards those with excellent anchor building skills. If done with a partner, one can back up anchors with meat, which would be ideal. If alone, one would do well to have Death Valley deadman and minimalist anchor building experience. The canyons in this area share this characteristic, especially the ones which have recently burned. Not recommended for those without such skills.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>The last rapp deposits you near R39. Find your way back to the road and hike up to your car, or use a short car shuttle.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Red_tape\">Red tape<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Beta_sites\">Beta sites<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media<\/h2><\/div>\n<ul><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http:\/\/sangabrielmnts.myfreeforum.org\/about5846.html\">Trip Report<\/a><\/li><\/ul>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Background\">Background<\/h2><\/div>\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nParsed by mw‐api‐ext.codfw.main‐6779cc57fc‐zgqh7\nCached time: 20240914192124\nCache expiry: 2592000\nReduced expiry: false\nComplications: [show‐toc]\nCPU time usage: 0.005 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.006 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 21\/1000000\nPost‐expand include size: 0\/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 0\/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 2\/100\nExpensive parser function count: 0\/500\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0\/20\nUnstrip post‐expand size: 0\/5000000 bytes\nNumber of Wikibase entities loaded: 0\/400\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%    0.000      1 -total\n-->\n<\/div>","id":2626,"rappelCountMax":4,"url":"https:\/\/ropewiki.com\/Cactus_Slot","quality":2,"waterRating":"A","timeRating":"II","geojson":null,"rappelCountMin":4,"longitude":-117.8943,"shuttleSeconds":null,"rappelLongestMeters":30.48,"name":"Cactus Slot","riskRating":"R","months":[],"version":"b0eb41a91392eaec152e610fd197284ccc7f45e998547f77f63170ada97085cd"}
