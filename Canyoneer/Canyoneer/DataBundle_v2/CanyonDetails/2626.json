  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>Cactus Slot is a short slot canyon of sorts that drops in just above\nAzusa and off the side of Route 39. There are 4+ rappels depending on\nwhat you want to downclimb, with anchor challenges throughout.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>Drive up R39 and park at the turnout for 2N28, which is on the\nleft/west side of the road just a short distance after passing Morris\nDam (the big fancy concrete one). Hike up the road a short distance and\nstay left, following a trail up the ridge past a water tank and to the\ntop of another ridge. Hike south along the ridge and decide upon where\nyou want to drop into the canyon. It is suggested that you hike down the\nspur north of the actual canyon, and drop in a short distance above the\ntechnical section. This is just before reaching the powerlines on the\nridge.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>The usual San Gabriel challenges present themselves. Bushwhacking,\npoisonous plants, cacti and succulents with sharp pointy bits, snakes,\nand really crummy anchor options. This canyon rewards those with\nexcellent anchor building skills. If done with a partner, one can back\nup anchors with meat, which would be ideal. If alone, one would do well\nto have Death Valley deadman and minimalist anchor building experience.\nThe canyons in this area share this characteristic, especially the ones\nwhich have recently burned. Not recommended for those without such\nskills.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>The last rapp deposits you near R39. Find your way back to the road\nand hike up to your car, or use a short car shuttle.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://sangabrielmnts.myfreeforum.org/about5846.html\">Trip\nReport</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n"
