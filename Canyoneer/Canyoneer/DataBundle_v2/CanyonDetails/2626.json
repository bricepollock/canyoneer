There are 4  rappels depending on what you want to downclimb, with anchor challenges throughout.\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Drive up R39 and park at the turnout for 2N28, which is on the left\/west side of the road just a short distance after passing Morris Dam (the big fancy concrete one). Hike up the road a short distance and stay left, following a trail up the ridge past a water tank and to the top of another ridge. Hike south along the ridge and decide upon where you want to drop into the canyon. It is suggested that you hike down the spur north of the actual canyon, and drop in a short distance above the technical section. This is just before reaching the powerlines on the ridge.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>The usual San Gabriel challenges present themselves. Bushwhacking, poisonous plants, cacti and succulents with sharp pointy bits, snakes, and really crummy anchor options. This canyon rewards those with excellent anchor building skills. If done with a partner, one can back up anchors with meat, which would be ideal. If alone, one would do well to have Death Valley deadman and minimalist anchor building experience. The canyons in this area share this characteristic, especially the ones which have recently burned. Not recommended for those without such skills.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>The last rapp deposits you near R39.
