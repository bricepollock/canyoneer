{"description":"<div class=\"mw-content-ltr mw-parser-output\" lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><p>Lord the Rings fans rejoice. This canyon might as well be the real-life version of the route to Mordor. This canyon likely could be done in a very long day but take note that an early start, strenuous day, and a headlamp exit are likely in your future. While you won't encounter any orcs, you may encounter bats, pikas, and some very healthy looking bear scat.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Hike the steep Gothic Basin Trail for about 4 miles (elevation gain of 2660'). Just before entering the basin at 4878', veer off the trail and drop down to a boulder field, heading to the saddle at the far side.\n<\/p><p>The next section involves some dirty, steep, bushy down-climbing. Using the surprisingly strong bushes to lower yourself without crashing into your team mates. It might be helpful to put on your harness to navigate through the next section in case you accidentally cliff-out. Continue forward and navigate your way around\/over a rock bend and through young trees until you reach the bottom of a large rock wall on your right. Follow the left-hand slope down an open rock field until you reach the drop in.\n<\/p><p>Note the first creek you reach may be a smaller tributary, R1 is at the larger creek from which you can see the canyon slot-up far below.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p><b>The Multi-Pitch Entrance<\/b>\n<\/p><p><i>Back-to-back rappels initially take you down broad open slabs, then drop you vertically into a unique square slot.

There’s some route-finding through the braids of the river bed, but overall it’s easy walking and easy navigation, with minimal brush. Cross the NF Sauk (which in August is ankle deep), and pickup the Monte Cristo trail a short way into the trees on the other side. Hike the trail back to the trailhead. This option allows for exiting with no re-ascent. Thanks to Adam Bercaw's memory of hiking this way as a 10 year old child.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading4\"><h4 id=\"Option_B_-_The_Original_Exit\">Option B - The Original Exit<\/h4><\/div>\n<p>Follow the meandering river gravels of Weeden Creek for 1 mile until you reach the point where you cut into the forest. The river disappears and re-appears through the river gravels in numerous spots. Before cutting into the trees, fill up on water and energy before entering the forest. The forest route is about 0.8 mi. Head West into the forest until you reach ~2430' where you will find pink flagging. The route has been flagged until you reach a shallow lake\/basin depending on the time of the year. Proceed uphill until you rejoin the approach trail.

Packs were heavy and the team decided to escape half way through the canyon due to time. The early exit and \"hike\" (if you could call it that) back to the car was brutal and took 5 hours. It consisted of bushwhacking through dense forest, monster fern fields, wet river gravels, and more dense forest with log jams and devil's club...all in the dark..and all the while being thirsty and starving. We started hiking at 630 AM and arrived back at our cars at 1230 AM the following day. \n<\/p><p>It took us 3 years to muster the courage again to attempt and thankfully complete a full descent of Weeden. The second time around, we planned to finish the canyon in 2 days and camped at the start of the middle narrows. It also decided to lightly rain on us all night because that's what Summers do in the PNW.\n<\/p><p><i>In a nerd voice...<\/i> well actually the first <i>full<\/i> descent of Weeden Creek was 10th Aug 2024, when a team ran it from Gothic Basin all the way to its conclusion at the Sauk River without exiting into the Forest along the way. However one day an even greater pedant may start the descent from the saddle above Foggy Lake just to out do everyone further!\n<\/p>\n\n\n<\/div>","months":["Aug","Sep","Jul"],"timeRating":"IV","shuttleSeconds":null,"url":"https:\/\/ropewiki.com\/Weeden_Canyon","name":"Weeden
