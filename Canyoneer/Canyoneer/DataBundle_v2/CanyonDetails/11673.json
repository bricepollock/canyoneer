It has plenty to offer and is a very pretty canyon to do, with some of the prettiest creek walking sections to be found in any canyon.\n<\/p><p>The canyon has 6 abseils of up to a maximum of 20mtrs, plenty of good anchor points from new slings, bolted anchors, with one final rope anchor point that is a bit of a stretch to reach. A 40mtr rope is more than plenty for this canyon, the first abseil can be bypassed, but really, I don't know why you would want to.\n<\/p><p><i><b>Quality<\/b><\/i>\n<\/p>\n<ul><li>The canyon is rated 4 out of 10 on the Brennan Quality Scale.<\/li>\n<li>David Noble rates the canyon 3 out of 5 for quality and Medium for difficulty.<\/li><\/ul>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>When you exit onto the mighty Wollangambie River, you can turn left and go upstream for a few hundred metres and exit up the track there (A good lunch or jump spot) or, you can head downstream to exit at the popular Wollangambie No 2 exit point, that is quite a way downstream.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Red_tape\">Red tape<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Beta_sites\">Beta sites<\/h2><\/div>\n<ul><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http:\/\/descente-canyon.com\/canyoning\/canyon-description\/21393\">Descente-Canyon.com<\/a>&#160;: Serendipity<\/li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https:\/\/ozultimate.com\/canyoning\/track_notes\/why_dont_we_do_it_in_the_road.htm\">OzUltimate.com<\/a>&#160;: Why Don't We Do It In The Road?
