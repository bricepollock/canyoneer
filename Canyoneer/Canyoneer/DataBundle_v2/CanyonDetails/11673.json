{"description":"<div class=\"mw-content-ltr mw-parser-output\" lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><p>Why Don't We Do It In The Road Canyon (AKA Serendipity Canyon) is one of the easier, more accessible canyons at Mount Wilson in the Blue Mountains of NSW. It has plenty to offer and is a very pretty canyon to do, with some of the prettiest creek walking sections to be found in any canyon.\n<\/p><p>The canyon has 6 abseils of up to a maximum of 20mtrs, plenty of good anchor points from new slings, bolted anchors, with one final rope anchor point that is a bit of a stretch to reach. A 40mtr rope is more than plenty for this canyon, the first abseil can be bypassed, but really, I don't know why you would want to.\n<\/p><p><i><b>Quality<\/b><\/i>\n<\/p>\n<ul><li>The canyon is rated 4 out of 10 on the Brennan Quality Scale.<\/li>\n<li>David Noble rates the canyon 3 out of 5 for quality and Medium for difficulty.<\/li><\/ul>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>When you exit onto the mighty Wollangambie River, you can turn left and go upstream for a few hundred metres and exit up the track there (A good lunch or jump spot) or, you can head downstream to exit at the popular Wollangambie No 2 exit point, that is quite a way downstream.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Red_tape\">Red tape<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Beta_sites\">Beta sites<\/h2><\/div>\n<ul><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http:\/\/descente-canyon.com\/canyoning\/canyon-description\/21393\">Descente-Canyon.com<\/a>&#160;: Serendipity<\/li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https:\/\/ozultimate.com\/canyoning\/track_notes\/why_dont_we_do_it_in_the_road.htm\">OzUltimate.com<\/a>&#160;: Why Don't We Do It In The Road?
