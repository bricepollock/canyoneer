  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>Surreal Garden of Eden originally developed under the patronage of\nwealthy eccentric Edward James. Located near the town of Xilitla, it's\nwell worth a visit if you are in the area.</p>\n<p>Full of odd sculptures and architecture, the waterfalls form\nfantastic swimming holes. There are trails to hike up to the top of the\nwaterfalls which could make it possible to rappel or slide down them, if\nsomeone was interested in such a thing.</p>\n<p>This attraction has become very popular in recent years and now has\ntour buses and lots of vendors outside the entrance, and other\nactivities such as a zipline park. You likely will need to make\nreservations in the town itself the day before you want to visit.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a\nhref=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Pozas\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Pozas</a></li>\n<li><a\nhref=\"https://plus.google.com/110977157737134599908/about?hl=en-US\">https://plus.google.com/110977157737134599908/about?hl=en-US</a></li>\n<li><a\nhref=\"http://www.laspozasxilitla.org.mx/?p=8\">http://www.laspozasxilitla.org.mx/?p=8</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n",
