The SUBW archive records, that this canyon within Dumbano Creek was visited on the 30th March 1962, but it was not until 19-20th August 1995 that it was given the name Suboir Canyon. It is also known as Dumbano Tunnels or the Dumbano Dungeons.\n<\/p><p>One could almost call the actual canyon, 60 second canyon.

After parking car at the suggested parking co-ords (4WD required), walk down the hill towards the creek, tending left so you arrive at an easy place to reach creek level. Follow the creek downstream, eventually it will close in, this is Dumbano Tunnels. A short walk and a side canyon comes in from the left that leads to a small amphitheatre. Turn left and Suboir starts\/ends just here.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Usually dry, but some wet places can exist after rain, or, it may even be flowing. about 2 minutes after starting, you are at the end, or the start, if you are heading upstream, you exit the canyon into a small area, a fixed line is up on the right, this may give you an alternate walk back to where you reached the creek.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Exit as you arrived, back upstream and back up the hill to your car.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Red_tape\">Red tape<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Beta_sites\">Beta sites<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Trip_reports_and_media_2\">Trip reports and media<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Background\">Background<\/h2><\/div>\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nParsed by mw‐api‐ext.codfw.main‐6779cc57fc‐lsd7t\nCached time: 20240914191853\nCache expiry: 2592000\nReduced expiry: false\nComplications: [show‐toc]\nCPU time usage: 0.005 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.007 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 24\/1000000\nPost‐expand include size: 0\/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 0\/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 2\/100\nExpensive parser function count: 0\/500\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0\/20\nUnstrip post‐expand size: 0\/5000000 bytes\nNumber of Wikibase entities loaded: 0\/400\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%    0.000      1 -total\n-->\n<\/div>","permit":"No","quality":2,"name":"Suboir Canyon"}
