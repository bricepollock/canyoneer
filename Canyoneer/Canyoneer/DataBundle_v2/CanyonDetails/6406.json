While not a major destination in its own right, it's worth\na visit if you're in the area and have a little time to spare. Can be\nrun an hour (or less if you have a shuttle).</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A wetsuit is recommended. Have your flotation dialed.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>The checkpoint is Big Creek from the bridge. Or just above the\nnarrows.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>The Big Creek Narrows is easily combined with other destinations in\nthe Wynoochee Valley. It's possible to visit 2-3 of them in a single\nday.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>While the original beta described this as a non-technical descent, a\nlarge logjam requiring a rappel has appeared near the top of the\nnarrows. For the first descent in a given year, it may be wise to bring\na short rope and harness. Logs washed downstream can get jammed in\nconstrictions. More debris fills in behind them to create a natural dam.\nSometimes, they can get quite large. Technical gear provides options\nshould you need them.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>Follow FR 22 to the bridge where it crosses Big Creek. This is a good\nplace to check the flow. The creek is not impressive from the bridge.\nLeave a car here and shuttle (or hike) east 0.2mi, then left on FR 2294.\nFollow for about 0.5mi when you can see the creek down through the trees\non the left. Park along the side of the road. There was a wide shoulder\nas of 2020 with plenty of room for parking. Suit up on at the road and\nbushwhack down wherever is easiest and drop into Big Creek.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>There are a couple of campsites right at the bridge over Big\nCreek.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>The original beta described following FR 2294 to the next bridge\nover Big Creek and descending from there. This will add +0.7mi of river\nwalking with no additional narrows. Not recommended.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>Head downstream about 5min. At first it is not very impressive. The\ncreek then abruptly swings left and the scenery changes dramatically.\nEnter the narrows. In several places fallen logs span the narrows\noverhead dripping with ferns and other epiphytes. Be aware the current\ncan be strong in places.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>R1: 10ft. As of 2020 a giant logjam has appeared inside the narrows.\nBring a short rope to rappel down to the bottom. Might be possible to\ndownclimb and pass underneath the logjam, but might not be recommended\nif the flow is high.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Pass through a beautiful narrows below the logjam. Sadly, the narrows\nis short and sweet. The creek passes through an interesting area of\nbedrock channels, then opens out again. An old water gauge station DCL\nis a sign you're getting close to the bridge.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>You can exit DCL up to the campsite, or, if occupied, continue to the\nbridge and exit DCL up to the road.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<p>None.</p>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><img src=\"rwl_en.png\" title=\"rwl_en.png\" alt=\"rwl_en.png\" /><a\nhref=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20210527212206/www.canyoneeringnorthwest.com/BigCreekNarrows/Big_Creek_Narrows.php\">CanyoneeringNorthwest.com\n(archive.org)</a> : Big Creek Narrows</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n",
