Pull from across the pool DCL where you can see the anchor. You probably need 280 feet to pull from across the pool. There is a rebelay anchor 70 feet down. Take caution because the pull is very hard from the rappel line due to the sloping angle of the rappel start. Its best to do the full rappel and pull from across the pool.<\/li><\/ul>\n<ul><li>R3: Option 2, 215 feet - webbing on a bolt station DCL. Flow DCL is strong. If you rap the edge of flow DCL you will come to a point where you have to enter the rooster tail or have to cross the flow above the rooster tail, the flow is strong at both of these areas. We had a guy run the flow down through the rooster tail so its possible but not recommended. Consider dropping or zip lining packs. The perfect line looks to be dropping in at DCR edge of the pour over, but I'm not sure the anchor location and angle will allow you to do that. The falls has only been run once so more testing is needed. You will need 260 feet on the pull side to pull from the shore DCR.<\/li><\/ul>\n<p>Its possible to explore Memaloose Creek (<a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external free\" href=\"http:\/\/ropewiki.com\/index.php\/Memaloose_Creek\">http:\/\/ropewiki.com\/index.php\/Memaloose_Creek<\/a>). Memaloose creek is relatively clear of debris and not a bad creek walk. \nR4 is located below the Memaloose Creek confluence.\n<\/p>\n<ul><li>There's a series of short slides down a groove in the middle of the creek just above R4 tree anchor.<\/li><\/ul>\n<ul><li>R4: 60 foot waterfall. Webbing anchor on a tree DCL 50 feet back. A great line is DCR of the log at the edge. This will land you on the rocks at the base of the falls. Logs are collecting at the base of the falls, watch for strainers in the future. Slide down off the rocks and swim through the logjam DCL. Throw the pull bag far DCL, over the leaning logs, and pull from the shore DCL. You want to avoid getting the rope caught at the edge, where the logs are leaning against the rocks.<\/li><\/ul>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Caution: Yellow jackets live and around downed trees!!\nDCL: Creek walk until you find a decent place to climb up to the approach trail. Usually this is beside a fallen tree because it gives you something to hold onto.  Exit the way you came in. \nDCR: Creek walk till you get to logjams blocking the river. Exit DCR and bushwack to the Clackamas River.

Original tracks and waypoints provided by Evan Topinka.\n<\/p><p><br \/>\nIn 1913, the young cities of Oregon City and West Linn suffered a serious outbreak of typhoid from an increasingly polluted Willamette River, their sole source of water at the time. The incident spurred Oregon City’s leaders to appoint a “Pure Mountain Water League” and directed it to locate a safer source of drinking water.\n<\/p><p>The League settled on the pristine South Fork of the Clackamas River in the Cascade foothills. The City of West Linn signed on with Oregon City, offering to pay for one third of the cost of a new pipeline to bring the South Fork water to the two cities. A South Fork Water Board was created to carry out this ambitious project.\n<\/p><p>By the fall of 1915, the new water district had managed to lay twenty-six miles of 18” pipe from a site at the confluence of Memaloose Creek and the South Fork Clackamas all the way to Oregon City and West Linn. The new pipeline began to carry municipal water on October 7, 1915.\n<\/p><p>In 1939 the South Fork Water Board expanded the system with the help of one of Franklin Roosevelt’s New Deal recovery programs, the Works Project Administration. This project extended a 24” pipeline upstream from the Memaloose Creek intake to a point upstream, above the 120-foot main falls on the South Fork.

Both systems were used until 1985, when the South Fork pipeline was decommissioned. Since then, the network of roads, tunnels, plank walkways, log bridges and old pipeline has slowly been fading into the green rainforest of the South Fork canyon.\n<\/p><p>The story might have ended there, except for the series of spectacular series of waterfalls along the South Fork and Memaloose Creek. By the late 1990s, some of the region’s more adventurous kayakers had scouted both streams, and in the early 2000s, had documented the first known descent of the South Fork by kayak.\n<\/p>\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nParsed by mw‐api‐ext.codfw.main‐6779cc57fc‐bqhrb\nCached time: 20240914191826\nCache expiry: 2592000\nReduced expiry: false\nComplications: []\nCPU time usage: 0.002 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.003 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 1\/1000000\nPost‐expand include size: 0\/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 0\/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 1\/100\nExpensive parser function count: 0\/500\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0\/20\nUnstrip post‐expand size: 0\/5000000 bytes\nNumber of Wikibase entities loaded: 0\/400\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%    0.000      1 -total\n-->\n<\/div>","id":1839,"months":["Jul","Aug","Sep","Oct"]}
