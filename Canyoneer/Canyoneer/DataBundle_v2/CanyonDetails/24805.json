  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>1/19/2024: Adam Haydock decided to have Jackpot canyon changed over\nto Buzzard Canyon. This aligns with Rick's book and ensures that there\nis no more confusion to published canyon content. I was looking at\ngoogle earth before a st. pattys day canyon event and wondered if anyone\never been down this drainage. Turned out that it was bolted when we went\nthrough. We ended up calling it Jackpot due to no beta, not having\nRick's book, and jackpot aligned with a Vegas st. pattys day.</p>\n<p>Do not enter this canyon if you do not have the knowledge to entirely\ninspect and replace anchorage. Do not assume anchorage is prepared to\nhold any load bearing weight upon your arrival. Bring anchorage\nreplacement material and be prepared to replace all anchorage. This\ncanyon floods and becomes hot. The sunbaked and worn webbing can break.\nInspect and Replace all anchorage.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>The standard approach is to park at the Weeping Springs trailhead.\nFrom here, hike up the 4x4 road until and follow the road until you get\nto a fork. There will be a fork in the road, go straight and continue\ndown to the vista overlook where the road ends and where the descent\nbegins.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>From the top of the rim, pick a number of ways down into the obvious\nvalley wash below and follow it into the drainage. Continue to follow\nthe main drainage until the canyon starts to narrow. Enjoy the hike\nthrough some scenic narrow corridors that meander down into a few\ndownclimbs. The canyon walls start to rise and not too long after, the\ncanyon opens up to a dramatic drop off.</p>\n<p>R1: 200' from tree, 2 stage, flick pull rope up over hump, DCR</p>\n<p>There is a small \"cave\" at the base of this rap full of loose soil\nand little else... Afterwards, there is a series of boulder downclimbs\nleading into to the second section of narrows.</p>\n<p>R2: 30 ft from tree.</p>\n<p>R3: 70 ft anchorage DCR</p>\n<p>R4: 20 ft anchorage DCL</p>\n<p>You will see the river from this point and the last three raps are\nthrough some scenic narrow meandering canyon. This is the author's\nfavorite section of the canyon.</p>\n<p>R5: 40 ft anchorage DCR</p>\n<p>R6: 30 ft anchorage DCL Here you will have a series of platforms\nwhere up to 5 people can fit. Inflate your rafts here.</p>\n<p>R7: 30 ft anchorage DCL into the river. Rappel into your already\ninflated raft.</p>\n<p>Link to download KML: <a\nhref=\"http://ropewiki.com/File:Jackpot_Canyon_.kml\">http://ropewiki.com/File:Jackpot_Canyon_.kml</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>You have options!</p>\n<p>Paddle 2.5 miles downstream to Crane's Nest</p>\n<p>Paddle 6 miles downstream to Willow Beach</p>\n<p>Paddle 1 mile upstream to Big Horn Canyon and use the beta for the\nBig Horn Canyon exit to hike back to your car at the top of the rim.</p>\n<p><em>\"As of Fall 2023, Bighorn Canyon is incredibly, perhaps\ndangerously overgrown in the stretch between the beach and the narrows.\nWe also encountered a large rattlesnake (speckled or arizona\ndiamondback) in the bushwhacking, but the concern is that it is so thick\nyou could easily step on a rattlesnake and not know it until you're bit.\nBetter alternative would be to packraft down to Crane's Nest to an exit\nvehicle.\"</em></p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<p>There is no red tape as far as I am aware of but there are a few\nthings to keep in mind:</p>\n<p>You must have a USCG approved PFD and packraft to float on the\ncolorado river. Parking at the weeping springs trailhead will be good\nfor high clearance. If you have a 4x4 high clearance with good tires,\nyou can continue to drive to the final rim where you descend down. That\nfinal section of road gets a bit rockier with a few steps to climb.</p>\n<p>Please remember that installation of permanent fixed hardware is\nstrictly prohibited in Black Canyon Wilderness area, and the entirety of\nLMNRA. No bolts.</p>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<p><a\nhref=\"https://www.stavislost.com/hikes/trail/buzzard-canyon-jackpot-canyon\">https://www.stavislost.com/hikes/trail/buzzard-canyon-jackpot-canyon</a>\n: Stav is Lost - October 6, 2023</p>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n<p>Rick Ianniello recorded the first known descent in his guide book,Las\nVegas Slots.

We\nfound most of the raps were bolted with hangers that have been painted\nnatural colors. These have all been removed since then...</p>\n",
