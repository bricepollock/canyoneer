Shuksan Creek might be a fun spot to add to your hit\nlist. It's not too horrible to get to and from what I've seen from you\nnut jobs, the lower canyon is right up your alley. I'll attach some\npictures. There's a big, huge, massive, multi-tiered waterfall at the\nhead of the canyon (couldn't find a clear spot to get pictures of, but\nit looks like several hundred feet tall in multiple tiers). There's a\nbeautiful lower falls as it exits the canyon, another 30-footer just\nupstream from that, and I saw several small drops that you could\nprobably jump, nice little slides, and all sorts of other stuff as I\npeered over the side. It's a really cool place.</em></p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n"
