  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>Wellman Basin is a remote canyon located on the north side of\nWhitehorse Mountain near Darrington. Multiple waterfalls cascade down\nfrom the small So-Bahli-Ahli glacier into Wellman Basin and might have\nyou thinking you're in the real-life version of Rivendell (for the Lord\nof the Rings fans). The approach is long and arduous with an infamous\nbushwhack to the top, but those willing to endure it will be rewarded\nwith a beautiful canyon that features many fun rappels and interesting\ngeologic layers.</p>\n<p>This beta documents just the lower section of the canyon. There are\nmultiple forks that drain into the lower section that have future canyon\npotential, but as of 2020, they have not been explored due to difficult\naccess. Don't forget to bring your camera - it's nearly impossible to\ntake a bad picture in this canyon -- don't forget to look back up.</p>\n<p>The canyon bottom is typically filled with snow and ice until mid to\nlate summer. The ice leaves behind impressive but unstable ice caves and\nice bridges so it is advisable to enter the canyon after most of the ice\nand snow has melted. Significant snow and ice may be visible from the\nbottom of the canyon.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p><strong>Getting There</strong></p>\n<p>From Arlington, take SR 530 east for 24 miles (about 30mins). Turn\nright onto an easily missed gravel road (48.2695, -121.6722) that soon\nends at a locked gate. Park at the gate making sure you are not blocking\naccess. There is a residence on the right side of the road here, so\nplease quiet and respectful.</p>\n<p>From Darrington, head west on SR 530 for 3.8 miles and turn left onto\nthe gravel road (48.2695, -121.6722).</p>\n<p><strong>The Approach</strong></p>\n<p>The approach consists of three sections:</p>\n<p><em>Logging Road</em> (2.2 miles). This is a mostly flat gravel\nlogging road that can be walked or easily be ridden on a bike (highly\nrecommended). When you encounter a split in the road at 48.2545,\n-121.6621, stay left. Soon you will encounter a large berm where you can\nwalk around on the left. Continue several hundred feet further and hide\nyour bikes in the surrounding forest. Biking will take 20-30mins,\nwalking will take 1h+).</p>\n<p><em>Forest Walk and Creekbed</em> (1 mile, 400' elevation gain). Push\nthrough a few feet of dense vegetation to enter the forest. The walk\nthrough the forest is easy. In 5-10mins you'll reach a dry creekbed.\nFollow the creekbed, navigating numerous fallen logs up until you reach\nthe the base of the falls (40-60mins).</p>\n<p><em>Uphill Bushwhack</em> (0.3 miles, 700' elevation gain). The\ninfamous Wellman bushwhack approach. After taking a look at the canyon\nfrom the bottom, backtrack to a large boulder on creek left. Scramble up\npast this boulder and traverse left across the hillside, looking for a\nsuitable spot to enter the brush. Ascend through the dense vine maple\nand devil's club, angling to the left slightly as you climb. Once you\nreach around 1,800' elevation, begin traversing to the left. Soon you'll\nreach a rocky outcrop with a view into the canyon below. Work your way\ndown to the canyon floor (this section is steep and chossy, so move\ncarefully). This section of the approach will take you 1.5-2 hours.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p><strong>DCR</strong> = Down Canyon Right</p>\n<p><strong>DCL</strong> = Down Canyon Left</p>\n<p><em>**Note on Potential Anchor Damage</em>: This canyon sees seasonal\nflooding, avalanches, and rockfall, which can damage bolts and webbing.\nIf you think you may be the first group of the season, be prepared for\npotential anchor damage. An emergency bolt kit and strong natural anchor\nskills are highly recommended. As a result of anchor damage potential,\nthis canyon has numerous unlinked bolted anchors. <strong>DO NOT ADD\nWEBBING TO THESE ANCHORS!</strong> Rockfall and debris can catch on\nlinked anchors and severely damage them. Groups should be familiar with\nrigging unlinked bolts.</p>\n<p><strong>R1</strong>: DCR - This is multi-pitch rappel out of the\nwatercourse.</p>\n<p>Pitch #1: 80' from a bolted anchor to a small ledge that can fit 2\npeople.</p>\n<p>Pitch #2: 170' from a bolted anchor.</p>\n<p><strong>R2</strong>: DCR - 80' from unlinked bolts. This anchor is\nset back away from the edge. There is a single bolt on CR to rappel out\nof the watercourse if desired.</p>\n<p><strong>R3</strong>: 40' from webbing around a boulder pinch</p>\n<p><strong>R4</strong>: 70' from webbing around a boulder. There are\noptions here for rappelling both in and out of the watercourse, which\ncould get quite intense in higher flow.</p>\n<p><strong>R5</strong>: DCR - 70' from unlinked bolts. The water funnels\ninto a narrow chute here. Be wary in higher flow. It is possible to\navoid the flow altogether DCL (although there is no established anchor\nhere)</p>\n<p><strong>R6</strong>: DCR - 30' from unlinked bolts. This drop has\nbeen downclimbed on CL.</p>\n<p><strong>R7</strong>: DCR - 100' from unlinked bolts. This is a\ntwo-stage rappel. This entire drop has been downclimbed, and as of 2020,\nthe lower pool is quite deep and can be jumped.</p>\n<figure>\n<img src=\"Wellman_Basin_Topo3.png\" width=\"600\" />\n</figure>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>Proceed back down the same way that you came.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n<p>The canyon was first descended on Sept 21, 2019 by Kevin Steffa,\nBarry Specht, Doug Hecker, Haruka-James Clay Lipcomb, Jake Huddleston,\nand Tiffanie Lin. Our team had attempted to descend Wellman Basin on\nSept 23, 2018 but the canyon and weather had different plans for us. It\nhad rained for 3 days prior and the forecast on Sunday promised a gray\nbut at least rain-free day. The bushwhack through dense and wet vine\nmaple and devil's club turned out to win the award for worst bushwhack\nof 2018. While we made it to our drop-in point, we were tired, drenched\nfrom the wet brush, and cold from the 50F temperatures and wind that\nswept through the canyon. The bushwhack had taken longer than expected\n(4 hours) and our team made the decision to bail and subjected ourselves\nto the worst bushwhack of the year again -- but downhill. We had a year\nto forget how heinous the bushwhack was and returned in 2019. The 2019\nWellman Basin trip is a trip that our team still looks fondly back on --\nthe sun was out, the teamwork was smooth, water conditions perfect, and\nwe were finally able to complete the canyon that shut us down the year\nprior.</p>\n",
