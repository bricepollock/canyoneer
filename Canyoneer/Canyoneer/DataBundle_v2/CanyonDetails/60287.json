class=\"mw-content-ltr mw-parser-output\" lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><p>Wellman Basin is a remote canyon located on the north side of Whitehorse Mountain near Darrington. Multiple waterfalls cascade down from the small So-Bahli-Ahli glacier into Wellman Basin and might have you thinking you're in the real-life version of Rivendell (for the Lord of the Rings fans). The approach is long and arduous with an infamous bushwhack to the top, but those willing to endure it will be rewarded with a beautiful canyon that features many fun rappels and interesting geologic layers.\n<\/p><p>This beta documents just the lower section of the canyon. There are multiple forks that drain into the lower section that have future canyon potential, but as of 2020, they have not been explored due to difficult access. Don't forget to bring your camera - it's nearly impossible to take a bad picture in this canyon -- don't forget to look back up.\n<\/p><p>The canyon bottom is typically filled with snow and ice until mid to late summer. The ice leaves behind impressive but unstable ice caves and ice bridges so it is advisable to enter the canyon after most of the ice and snow has melted. Significant snow and ice may be visible from the bottom of the canyon.\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p><b>Getting There<\/b>\n<\/p><p>From Arlington, take SR 530 east for 24 miles (about 30mins). Turn right onto an easily missed gravel road (48.2695, -121.6722) that soon ends at a locked gate. Park at the gate making sure you are not blocking access. There is a residence on the right side of the road here, so please quiet and respectful.\n<\/p><p>From Darrington, head west on SR 530 for 3.8 miles and turn left onto the gravel road (48.2695, -121.6722).\n<\/p><p><b>The Approach<\/b>\n<\/p><p>The approach consists of three sections:\n<\/p><p><i>Logging Road<\/i> (2.2 miles). This is a mostly flat gravel logging road that can be walked or easily be ridden on a bike (highly recommended). When you encounter a split in the road at 48.2545, -121.6621, stay left. Soon you will encounter a large berm where you can walk around on the left. Continue several hundred feet further and hide your bikes in the surrounding forest. Biking will take 20-30mins, walking will take 1h ). \n<\/p><p><i>Forest Walk and Creekbed<\/i> (1 mile, 400' elevation gain). Push through a few feet of dense vegetation to enter the forest. The walk through the forest is easy. In 5-10mins you'll reach a dry creekbed. Follow the creekbed, navigating numerous fallen logs up until you reach the the base of the falls (40-60mins).\n<\/p><p><i>Uphill Bushwhack<\/i> (0.3 miles, 700' elevation gain). The infamous Wellman bushwhack approach. After taking a look at the canyon from the bottom, backtrack to a large boulder on creek left. Scramble up past this boulder and traverse left across the hillside, looking for a suitable spot to enter the brush. Ascend through the dense vine maple and devil's club, angling to the left slightly as you climb. Once you reach around 1,800' elevation, begin traversing to the left. Soon you'll reach a rocky outcrop with a view into the canyon below. Work your way down to the canyon floor (this section is steep and chossy, so move carefully). This section of the approach will take you 1.5-2 hours.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p><b>DCR<\/b> = Down Canyon Right\n<\/p><p><b>DCL<\/b> = Down Canyon Left\n<\/p><p><i>**Note on Potential Anchor Damage<\/i>: This canyon sees seasonal flooding, avalanches, and rockfall, which can damage bolts and webbing. If you think you may be the first group of the season, be prepared for potential anchor damage. An emergency bolt kit and strong natural anchor skills are highly recommended. As a result of anchor damage potential, this canyon has numerous unlinked bolted anchors. <b>DO NOT ADD WEBBING TO THESE ANCHORS!<\/b> Rockfall and debris can catch on linked anchors and severely damage them. Groups should be familiar with rigging unlinked bolts.\n<\/p><p><b>R1<\/b>: DCR - This is multi-pitch rappel out of the watercourse.\n<\/p><p>Pitch #1: 80' from a bolted anchor to a small ledge that can fit 2 people. \n<\/p><p>Pitch #2: 170' from a bolted anchor.\n<\/p><p><b>R2<\/b>: DCR - 80' from unlinked bolts.

Our team had attempted to descend Wellman Basin on Sept 23, 2018 but the canyon and weather had different plans for us. It had rained for 3 days prior and the forecast on Sunday promised a gray but at least rain-free day. The bushwhack through dense and wet vine maple and devil's club turned out to win the award for worst bushwhack of 2018.  While we made it to our drop-in point, we were tired, drenched from the wet brush, and cold from the 50F temperatures and wind that swept through the canyon. The bushwhack had taken longer than expected (4 hours) and our team made the decision to bail and subjected ourselves to the worst bushwhack of the year again -- but downhill. We had a year to forget how heinous the bushwhack was and returned in 2019. The 2019 Wellman Basin trip is a trip that our team still looks fondly back on -- the sun was out, the teamwork was smooth, water conditions perfect, and we were finally able to complete the canyon that shut us down the year prior.\n<\/p>\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nParsed by mw‐api‐ext.codfw.main‐6779cc57fc‐f4cs4\nCached time: 20240914191902\nCache expiry: 2592000\nReduced expiry: false\nComplications: []\nCPU time usage: 0.003 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.004 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 1\/1000000\nPost‐expand include size: 0\/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 0\/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 1\/100\nExpensive parser function count: 0\/500\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0\/20\nUnstrip post‐expand size: 0\/5000000 bytes\nNumber of Wikibase entities loaded: 0\/400\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%    0.000      1 -total\n-->\n<\/div>","vehicle":"Passenger","version":"a631e2b88e93da0554f3b6cc84fa238182b8569c12815faca5c07ce44f3cb799"}
