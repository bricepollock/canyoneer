{"description":"<div class=\"mw-content-ltr mw-parser-output\" lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><p>Nestled in the shadow of the Pelham Range and on the traditional territories of the Huu-ay-aht First Nations, Sarita Ita (meaning “Little Sarita”) cuts a series of scenic waterfalls on its way to joining the Sarita River. Particularly memorable is a beautiful 50m horsetailing waterfall that dives into a deep pool below. Sarita Ita is a fun day with an easy approach, easy exit, and every rappel through the flow.\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Park your exit vehicle(s) at a pullout next to where the creek crosses Bamfield Road at 48.93747, -124.81263. To reach the start, continue west on Bamfield Road for 0.75km and turn right (north) onto a logging road that begins to climb steeply. Park at a pullout near where the road forks at 48.94125, -124.81777. If you don’t have a shuttle vehicle, you can easily hike the shuttle (approximately 1.4km and 100m elevation gain).\n<\/p><p>Hike up the old logging road for 1.1km and 160m elevation gain. The road becomes overgrown but travel remains fairly easy. When you reach yellow flagging (not ours) at 48.94469, -124.80728, pick the best path down to the creek through the forest.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p><b>R1 -<\/b> 10m from DCC log across the pool. R1 could be a potential jump, but it is very slippery at the edge. Pool at the bottom is over 3m deep. \n<\/p><p><b>R2 -<\/b> 30m from high DCL tree\n<\/p><p>Next is a series of drops made interesting with logjams. Multiple anchor options are available. We downclimbed nearly everything with a short rappel (R3) in the middle.\n<\/p><p><b>R3 -<\/b> 4m off DCC log just before the creek doglegs to the right\n<\/p><p>After the creek zags sharply to the right, squeeze through a DCL rabbit hole and continue downclimbing on boulders and ledges to the bottom of the drop. \n<\/p><p>A better way to rig for future parties may be off a high DCR anchor to descend the whole series in one drop. \n<\/p><p><b>R4 -<\/b> 12m from DCC upturned log\n<\/p><p><b>R5 -<\/b> 4m from DCC upturned log\n<\/p><p><b>R6 -<\/b> 12m from DCL single bolt\n<\/p><p>The next sequence is the big falls. All of the water in the creek concentrates into a horsetail falls that dives over a nearly vertical drop. Safely access the R7 anchor (it’s slippery) using a 5m traverse line from a giant tree DCR. \n<\/p><p><b>R7 -<\/b> 50m from DCR tree near the edge. A spectacular line that takes you through the heart of the flow. You will get hammered at the bottom, and it’s great.\n<\/p><p><b>R8 -<\/b> 20m from DCC log across the creek\n<\/p><p>After R8 there is a massive, multi-story logjam that is downclimbable DCR. \n<\/p><p><b>R9 -<\/b> 30m off high DCR tree into a little rain room that is kind of fun\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Continue downcanyon for 300m until you reach the bridge over the road. Exit the creek DCR just below the bridge and scramble up to your cars.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Red_tape\">Red tape<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Beta_sites\">Beta sites<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media<\/h2><\/div>\n<p><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https:\/\/m.facebook.com\/groups\/485642308115596\/permalink\/5850356001644173\/\">Photos from first descent in July 2022<\/a>\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Background\">Background<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Sarita Ita was first descended on July 3, 2022 by Kevin Steffa, Madeline Hwang, Emil Cakiryan, and Kelly Morr.
