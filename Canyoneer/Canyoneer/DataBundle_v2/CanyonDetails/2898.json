  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>This is a really scenic canyon with most sections in polished granite\nand some with marble. In typical late season flows, there are only minor\nswift water challenges, but in higher conditions, there is a serious\npotential for hydraulics and a dangerous sieve to form in the early part\nof the technical section. Canyoneers should attempt only at medium to\nlow flows. Flow can be assessed at the bridge by the campground, and\nagain at the top of the first rappel, which directly overlooks the\nnarrowest section of the canyon.</p>\n<p>This canyon was originally explored as a potential kayaking route by\nPaul Martzen in 1985. He made the first descent on foot (a practice now\nknown as canyoneering) from Ross Crossing Road to Balch camp in 1988,\nand returned the following year to complete the kayaking first descent\nfrom Ross Creek Confluence to Balch Camp. This description describes\nwhat Paul refers to as \"Dinkey Creek Cascades\", a canyoneering route\nfrom Ross Crossing Road to Ross Creek Confluence, which lies above the\nkayaking route. This canyon can be enjoyed as a 2+ day adventure\ncontinuing down to Balch Camp, or in one long day (10~18hrs) by taking\none of the 2 other exit options returning back up to Ross Crossing Road,\ngaining 2000' of elevation on the hike out.</p>\n<p>The current and past water flow can be checked online at <a\nhref=\"http://www.dreamflows.com/graphs/day.453.php\">http://www.dreamflows.com/graphs/day.453.php</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>Two possible approaches exist.</p>\n<p>1) From Ross Crossing Campground Hike along the river until the walls\ndevelop and continue down canyon.</p>\n<p>2) From Ross Crossing Campground, drive approximately 1 mile\nSouthwest (towards Shaver Lake) on Ross Crossing Road, and park at the\ngate on the left side of the road. Hike down the quarry access road\nuntil you reach a boulder lined clearing. Scramble down the boulder\nfield slopes travelling East, and follow a shallow drainage down towards\nthe river, taking the path of least resistance. At the base of some\ngranite slabs, traverse right before descending down a crack system, and\nscramble down a gulley down to the river at (36.979313, -119.122673).\nThis approach takes less than 20 minutes and shaves off approximately\n3/4 of a mile of river walking and boulder hopping.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>The canyon can be divided into two sections with distinctly different\ncharacter. The upper section of the canyon can be done as a long day,\nwith a steep 2000' elevation hike out with some route finding and/or\nbushwhacking involved. The lower section, combined with the upper, is\ntypically done as a 2 day adventure.</p>\n<h3 id=\"upper_dinkey_creek\">Upper Dinkey Creek</h3>\n<p>From Ross Crossing Rd to Ross Creek is approximately 2 river miles\nwhich drops 1200 feet (1.25 miles and 1000' from the granite quarry drop\nin). This section is very technical with numerous rappels, a few jumps\nand significant downclimbing. Flows above 10 cfs are likely very\ndangerous. This section has up to 11 rappels, a few of which can be\ndownclimbed by the skilled. This section should take 6-7 hours.</p>\n<p>From the drop in point, continue down canyon along the river until\nyou reach a 20' drop with highly sculpted rock. This is a good place to\nchange into wetsuits.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>J1: Jump from a ledge (8'), or bypass on canyon right.</li>\n<li>J2: Short jump form the middle of the water course.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Continue down canyon with some boulder hopping and easy downclimbing.\nThe canyon walls start to narrow, and a long (~200') swim deposits you\nat the top of the first rappel.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>R1: double bolt anchor on canyon left, a straight forward sloping\nrappel that drops you down back into the water course. A bit of swimming\nand scrambling quickly leads you to the top of R2, where the fun really\nbegins.</li>\n<li>R2 is a two stage drop rigged with a double bolt anchor on a large\nboulder on canyon left. The second half of the ~60’ drop puts you\ndirectly under the force of the water flow.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>R2 is followed by a short swim through a narrow channel, which is\nblocked by a massive boulder. This boulder is what I will call the “Over\nor Under” obstacle, as it can be defeated either by going over it, or\nunder it. Going over involves climbing a log jam, and stemming across a\nwide gap to traverse on top of this feature. Going under is quite\nentertaining, and gets you half way through, where you must climb up\nonto the boulder anyway. The climb was much harder for the “Under”\nvariation, but both variations required some slings to be tossed around\nlog jams to create steps to ascend the feature. This obstacle would\nbecome deadly in high flows, as the water runs below the boulder through\nsome log jams, which can easily create a strainer.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>R3 is a very dramatic drop, which starts off on the top of a house\nsized boulder, and then descends down into the water course of a triple\ntier waterfall. The total drop is 150’+.</li>\n<li>R4 is a short (~40’) rappel rigged off of bolts. Continue on rappel\ndown the drop for another 10’, or jump into the small but deep pothole\nfrom ledges on canyon left.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Here, the canyon eases for a little bit, providing a welcome\nopportunity to warm back up in the sun. This is a good spot for a lunch\nbreak (N 36 58.290, W 119 07.249, 3800’). Some scrambling, downclimbing,\nand swimming gets you to the next rappel.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>R5: From a double bolt anchor on canyon right, rappel ~50’ down to\nthe large pool below. A short swim leads to the top of the next\nrappel.</li>\n<li>R6: ~30’ rappel on canyon right.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>From here, the canyon widens, and gently but continuously loses\nelevation until the Ross Creek confluence.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>J3: 8’ jump into a nice big pool, which puts you at the top of R7 (N\n36 58.136, W 119 07.242, 3400’)</li>\n<li>R7-R10 are a series of 4 long rappels down slabs that can be down\nclimbed by the skilled.</li>\n<li>R11: ~70’</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Some boulder hopping, scrambling, and swimming leads to a large pool\nright before the Ross Creek confluence (N36 57.887, W119 07.471, 3000’).\nThe upper technical section should take 5-7 hrs for the average\ngroup.</p>\n<h3 id=\"lower_dinkey_creek\">Lower Dinkey Creek</h3>\n<p>From Ross Creek to Balch Camp, the canyon is long but does not\npresent as much technical challenge. There are only a couple mandatory\nrappels and the rest are all optional. I think all rappels are under 50\nfeet. Most groups will have more fun jumping some of the short drops\nrather than rappelling them. Jumping is also recommended at high flow,\nwhen the rappels may be too dangerous. All big rappels should have\nanchors options way out of the water flow or might be bypassed (with\neffort) if needed. This lower section from Ross Creek is commonly boated\nby expert kayakers, usually taking two days. This section has been\ncanyoneered at higher flows around 50 cfs.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>There are 3 choices for exit.</p>\n<p>1) The recommended choice is to make this a two day trip and walk all\nthe way to Balch Camp. This allows a car to car canyon trip with minimal\nhiking at either end. The upper section from Ross Crossing to Ross Creek\nwill take most of the first day while the second day below Ross Creek\nwill go pretty fast. Both the upper and lower sections are very pretty.\nThe shuttle drive is long and tiresome. Shuttle will take 1-2 hours each\nway between Balch Camp and Ross Crossing.</p>\n<p>2) Ross Creek kayakers trail. This minimizes the shuttle, makes a one\nday trip and shows off the most spectacular section. However, if you do\nnot find the best trail, you will be bushwacking through the night! Some\nkayakers have been maintaining this trail, but scout it from the top to\nmake sure you can find it. There are several areas where routes can\ndiverge. The passage below describes a route that has been executed in\nas few as 3~4 hours, which is relatively fast compared to most trip\nreports (most ranging from 6~8 hrs).</p>\n<ul>\n<li>From the Ross Creek Confluence, travel upstream up Ross Creek, and\nthen Turtle Creek, as you reach the intersection. Cross over to the\nright (i.e. river left) of Turtle Creek where ever convenient.</li>\n<li>Climb up steep slabs on climbers right (i.e. river left), making\nyour own switch backs as needed.</li>\n<li>When you reach a water fall, scramble up around climber's left\n(river right) and keep going, following the canyon rim.</li>\n<li>Eventually, you will approach a ~60 degreed dark mossy rock to a\nshort headwall. Climb this slightly dirty but featured rock to gain some\nvegetated ledges below a short headwall.</li>\n<li>Climb the headwall directly (one lower 5th class move) up a chimney,\nor scramble through vegetation to gain the ridge.</li>\n<li>From here, continue up slabs looking for a weakness in the\nmanzanita, and cut across, traversing along the contour line until you\nreach Ross Creek. You should be looking over some nice teacups\nbelow.</li>\n<li>Follow Ross Creek on climber's left (i.e. river right) of Ross\nCreek, through some bushes, until you enter a lightly wooded area.</li>\n<li>From here, pick up a faint use trail keeping Ross Creek within\nearshot (but barely out of sight), which takes you back up to Ross\nCrossing Road. Beware of poison oak!</li>\n</ul>\n<p>3) Bed Springs trail. Not Recommended. This is an old 4 wheel drive\nroad that meets the creek on canyon left, about a mile and a half\ndownstream of Ross Creek. There are bed springs, an old refrigerator,\nremains of old cars and such, marking the bottom of this route. The road\nis overgrown in spots, but mostly clear walking for 3.5 miles with 2000'\nof elevation gain. Very tiring after a long day of canyoneering.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<p>None.</p>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a\nhref=\"http://www.kayakphoto.com/darinmcquoid/dinkeycreek.html\">Kayaker\nbeta</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a\nhref=\"http://canyoncollective.com/threads/dinkey-creek-california.3692/\">Trip\nReport documenting the First Descent circa 1988</a></li>\n<li><a\nhref=\"https://www.americanwhitewater.org/content/River/detail/id/179/\">A\ndescription of the Canyoneering Route written by Paul on a Kayaking Beta\nPage</a></li>\n<li><a\nhref=\"http://forums.boof.com/showthread.php?5526-Dinkey-Creek-Cascades\">A\nTrip Report from a return trip in 2008</a></li>\n<li><a\nhref=\"http://ourgoodfriendgravity.tumblr.com/post/72304225188\">Trip\nReport</a> by <a href=\"User:Ihiromi\" title=\"wikilink\">Ihiromi</a> from\nOctober 2013</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.whitewaterassault.com/?p=841\">Trip Report of a\ncanyoneering descent of the lower section from Ross Creek Confluence to\nBalch Camp</a></li>\n<li><a\nhref=\"http://www.alltravels.com/united-states/california/balch-camp/photos/current-photo-49965343\">Canyon\npictures on Panoramio</a></li>\n<li><a\nhref=\"http://www.rangeoflight.org/album.php?id=18&amp;effect=fade&amp;dlkey=&amp;prokey=&amp;size=hd&amp;delay=1000#/83\">Pictures\nfrom 2008</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n<p>The first descent was done by Paul Martzen and Barry Chambers on\nAugust 20~21st, 1988.
