There is no obvious path to follow so look for faint footprints and find your way through the brush to the top. If you stay to the left, you will gain the top of the ridge at a rocky clearing near the neck of a V-shaped valley; a well-worn trail proceeds up the spine of the ridge to your left. If you emerge on the ridge too far to the right, you will have to traverse along a faint brush-ridden trail that dips slightly below the other side of the ridge.  \n<\/p><p>Continue ascending along the ridge on the well-worn trail for another 70m \/ 230ft until you reach a barren, rocky spot, offering unobstructed views of the V-shaped valley to the west.

The rappel is a bit overhanging after the first edge, but soon is directly in the main watercourse. Pull from the bottom is no issue.
