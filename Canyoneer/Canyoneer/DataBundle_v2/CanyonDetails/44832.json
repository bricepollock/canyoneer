As both creeks were canyons, they didn't find their pass out and\nas a result were overdue. Keith Seddon named both creeks \"Hartleys\nMistake Canyons\". The canyon downstream has since gained the singular\nname \"Hartleys Mistake Canyon\". This canyon was named by Tim Hager\n(Catholic Bushwalking Club) who led a trip down this creek - probably in\n1978.</p>\n",
