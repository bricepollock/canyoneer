  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>Guanapo Gorge seems to be the only known/explored slot canyon in\nTrinidad, although there are almost certainly others, which may or may\nnot be known and explored. While not a technical canyon, you're bound to\nhave fun here, with some jumps and swims. A handline is useful. Avoid\nrains and high water at all costs - there is absolutely no escape!</p>\n<p>Two things to know:</p>\n<p>1. Trinidad is filled with extremely venomous snakes, such as the\nbushmaster. Bites are rare, but keep your eyes open. Wearing boots is\nrecommended.</p>\n<p>2. The Gpx track on this page may be off by 100 feet or so - thick\njungle canopy decreases accuracy. Take the description on this page with\nyou.</p>\n<p>That said, this is a small adventure that Trinidadians do on the\nweekend. Experienced canyoneers should be fine here.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>Guanapo is accessed by a dirt road to a quarry, and then a hiking\ntrail cut by hunters. The road is fine for passenger vehicles, except\nafter heavy rains. Hitchhiking the last few kilometers is easy.</p>\n<p>The 'Trailhead' is a split just past the first quarry on your left.\nTake the dirt track on the left, using the GPS point. </p>\n<p>Follow the trail for almost 2 kilometers. It's a poorly maintained\n4wd track. You'll pass a couple shacks about 30 minutes in. Then, the\njeep track ends, and you're on a foot-only path which will quickly drop\ndown maybe 50 vertical meters to a stream.</p>\n<p>At the stream, walk in the water, which is generally knee-to-thigh\ndeep, and head upstream for 15-20 minutes until the first\nconfluence.</p>\n<p>Take a bush path that goes between the two streams. There should be\norange flagging here. After barely a minute or two, you'll see an\nobvious sign that says 'Sombasson Tr.'</p>\n<p>Follow the bush path uphill for 10-15 minutes. The flagging is\nnear-continuous, and the trail is easy enough to follow. You may have to\npass a couple of downed trees, but you should not be bushwhacking at\nall.</p>\n<p>The trail then goes down briefly, is somewhat flat, goes up a little,\nand comes to a nondescript T-intersection. Head right.</p>\n<p>Follow the trail for several minutes downhill, until arriving at a\nstream. There is a small, old concrete dam here. This is the start of\nGuanapo Gorge.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>From the dam, walk and swim in the water heading downstream for 10\nminutes.</p>\n<p>The canyon will start to slot up.</p>\n<p>The true start starts with a waterfall downclimb of around six feet.\nIn high water, this may seem terrifying, and could be dangerous. Please\nassess carefully! If in doubt, retreat! You can always go back and\nupclimb from the bottom.</p>\n<p>Do no jump blindly into this pool - though it appears deep, plenty of\nlogs get watching in regularly.</p>\n<p>A handline may be helpful here.</p>\n<p>Within the slot, there a number of small downclimbs and swims.\nThere's no escape until the end. Going through the slot should take\naround 30 minutes, possibly less.</p>\n<p>As mentioned, every flood washes in logs and trumps and can create\nreal hazards.</p>\n<p>The slow started to open at a final 1.5 meter falls, which you can\njump into a stunning deep, blue pool. Here, the canyon ends.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>After exiting the gorge, follow the stream for 100 meters to a small\nconfluence, and follow this downstream for another 100 meters to\nre-intersect with the trail you used for the approach. No bushwhacking\nhere!</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<p>There are sometimes hunters in the area. Hunters are friendly and\npose no problems. They use hunting dogs, which are generally friendly.\nIf in doubt, just say hi and wave. Crime doesn't seem to be a problem in\nthis part of Trinidad.</p>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<p>More info on the canyon and surrounding jungle:\nwww.lukaseddy.com/Trinidad-and-Tobago/</p>\n<p>A video with clips of the canyon can be viewed at: <a\nhref=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=APvJ5_C9wW4\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=APvJ5_C9wW4</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n<p>This slot has been known of, and occasionally descended by locals,\nfor many years. The first discovery is unknown, and seems probable that\nindigenous peoples would have known of it. This beta was written by\nLukas Eddy in December 2022.</p>\n",
