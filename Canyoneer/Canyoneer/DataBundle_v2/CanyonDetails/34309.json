Rap 1 may possibly be downclimbed but it would be a bad idea due to an awkward start to get under a false floor and the lower portion being very slick with moss. Note - Rap 1 alternate anchor options: There is a large pine tree near the head of the drop that could be used but would place the rope over a VERY sharp edge. There are also choke stones at the top of the drop but these will force the rope into v-slots creating rope pull issues and create a very awkward start. Right after rap 1 is another drop of about 35 feet that is bypassed by climbing down along the crack and ledge system on the RDC side. There are a lot of little huecos in the rock here that are interesting to look at and play in. Part way down the ledge system on the RDC side is a drop of about 6 feet that is pretty awkward. providing a handline to everyone and a partner assist here for the last person makes this pretty simple. Although this drop is a downclimb it looks like a bad idea when just looking from the top. After getting someone down on rope they can easily assist others. About 50 feet after the downclimb is rap2.

Anchored from choke stone and drops about 140 feet with a ledge about 25 feet from the bottom into a huge deep feeling chamber. The anchor is down on the floor of the skinny crack where it is difficult to get to. Starting rap 3 is awkward as you need to stem out past the false floor and past more skinny crack where you will not fit down through then rap down under the false floor where you need to pendulum under a little ways. This start is made more awkward since it is skinny making it difficult to get you and your pack to squeeze through. Facing RDC allows better features for the stem out and pendulum under the top of rap 3. With a lot of effort and attention; the pendulum action can be slow and controlled. If this place were to be bolted one day this rappel would be a good candidate for a solid set of hangers to allow a rap straight down and no pendulum action. Exiting the down canyon end of the chamber below rap 3 is done by laying down on your side and worming through a narrow opening at the canyon floor and pushing your pack along the canyon floor for about 6 feet to get where you can stand up and walk. There is one other possible exit about 8 feet up where the crack widens but it would be very difficult to get up to. The rest of the crack is not large enough to allow exit. Rap 4 is almost 500 feet down canyon after the chamber and is easy wash walking with one downclimb of about 6 feet. (Data by bluugnome.com)",

Anchored from a large pine tree about 65 feet back from the drop then drops down sloped slick rock another 75 feet down to a small ledge down in the slot on the LDC side large enough for 2 to 3 people. The small ledge is right where the crack goes vertical; deep and dark. From the small ledge scramble up a sloped slickrock ramp to a large vegetated ledge. The scramble up is moderately easy but the consequences of a fall will be fatal as you will fall into the very deep vertical crack. BE SURE to belay the first person up who can then set a rope on a nearby tree to assist everyone else. The belay for the first person up can be done with the rappel rope from rap 5 but a fall would result in a pendulum like fall / tumble. WARNING: This is a tricky spot and care must be taken. This spot is dangerous and careful thought of how to proceeded is needed. Note: To belay the first person up the slickrock ramp a 190 foot rope is recommended for rap 5. About 150 feet own to the small ledge and another 40 feet up the ramp to the wide vegetated ledge / shelf. Once up the slickrock ramp and onto the large vegetated ledge; walk down canyon about 180 feet down canyon to a downclimb of about 6 feet where at the bottom you can anchor from a large pine tree for rap 6 down into the slot. Note: Another option would be to rig from a large tree near the top of the ramp and drop down into the slot from there. Where a 300 foot rope will likely be more than long enough for the rappel but this has not been confirmed. Also of note if you drop down the head of the crack by rappelling here you will be on the up canyon side of a pool to swim at the floor of the crack. To avoid this pool use the rappel station down canyon as described here. (Data by bluugnome.com)",

          "description": "Rap 6 - South Gaurdian Angel Canyon. Anchored from a large pine and drops about 240 feet down into the deep dark crack with a few ledges along the way. A partner assistable downclimb of about 6 feet is just before getting to the anchor. Be very careful not to knock rocks off this sloped dirt and rock filled ledge. When pulling your ropes be sure to walk a little up canyon to keep your ropes from pulling down onto logs jammed overhead. At the bottom of rap 6 is a flat level sandy floor in the bottom of the deep dark crack where you can walk up canyon about 160 feet to the lower part of the vertical head wall of the crack and walk about 300 feet down canyon to where the crack starts to open up and you get to the next rap. Take time to enjoy the belly of this crack as it is a very unique place since it is a combination of water course and deep fault. (Data by bluugnome.com)",

The first 25 feet is down a wall then the rap goes free hanging the rest of the way down in a huge very scenic alcove. This is an amazing view so take time to enjoy it! Warning: Be sure to extend the the webbing for the anchor all the way and slightly over the lip to ensure an easier pull and make the drop only 305 feet. The rappel starts down a crack which you can easily downclimb into while on rope allowing a safe way to get down the start of the rappel with the anchor webbing extended slightly over the lip. There are big flat ledges on both sides of this rappel. The RDC ledge allows you to laydown and look over to see the entire drop and see if your rope bag is on the ground. From the bottom of the final rap walk down canyon around a huge rock and dirt island with a couple scramble spots down to the Subway about 750 feet west. (Data by bluugnome.com)",
