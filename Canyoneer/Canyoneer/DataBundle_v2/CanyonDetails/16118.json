Group of 5. Canyon time 1:20. We set up a shuttle. First rappel off bridge about 40 feet. Final rappel 75 feet into a gigantic pool, ledge about 30 feet from the bottom may be a jumping point but we did not try it. Water is dark brown from tannins. All jumps and slides must be tested by rappel first.\n<\/p><p><br \/>\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Background\">Background<\/h2><\/div>\n\n\n<\/div>","name":"Fazenda","waterRating":"B","vehicle":null,"url":"https:\/\/ropewiki.com\/Fazenda","quality":3.2,"geojson":{"features":[{"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[[-31.1496,39.4678,0]]},"type":"Feature","properties":{"name":"Start"}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"coordinates":[[-31.141623,39.469901,0]],"type":"Point"},"properties":{"name":"End"}},{"geometry":{"type":"LineString","coordinates":[[-31.149628,39.467873,0],[-31.149322,39.468068,0],[-31.149091,39.468213,0],[-31.148932,39.468291,0],[-31.148799,39.468355,0],[-31.14864,39.468418,0],[-31.1485,39.468466,0],[-31.148372,39.468503,0],[-31.148253,39.468516,0],[-31.148126,39.468526,0],[-31.147891,39.468522,0],[-31.147746,39.468487,0],[-31.147678,39.468453,0],[-31.147563,39.468418,0],[-31.147372,39.468403,0],[-31.147229,39.46841,0],[-31.147113,39.468432,0],[-31.147,39.468508,0],[-31.146824,39.468597,0],[-31.146659,39.468589,0],[-31.146532,39.468584,0],[-31.146383,39.468584,0],[-31.146236,39.468609,0],[-31.146131,39.468643,0],[-31.145937,39.468708,0],[-31.145616,39.468802,0],[-31.145407,39.468849,0],[-31.145178,39.468911,0],[-31.145039,39.468944,0],[-31.144893,39.468939,0],[-31.144747,39.468925,0],[-31.144543,39.468951,0],[-31.144361,39.46899,0],[-31.144241,39.469039,0],[-31.144051,39.469101,0],[-31.143968,39.469166,0],[-31.143957,39.469279,0],[-31.143978,39.469374,0],[-31.143983,39.469458,0],[-31.143915,39.469561,0],[-31.143741,39.469615,0],[-31.143567,39.469633,0],[-31.143371,39.46963,0],[-31.143269,39.469595,0],[-31.143181,39.469576,0],[-31.143042,39.469589,0],[-31.142969,39.469588,0],[-31.142804,39.469555,0],[-31.142674,39.469529,0],[-31.142536,39.469518,0],[-31.142409,39.469519,0],[-31.142267,39.469529,0],[-31.142103,39.469604,0],[-31.141978,39.469679,0],[-31.141796,39.469751,0],[-31.141623,39.469901,0]]},"properties":{"name":"Descent","stroke":"#FF0000"},"type":"Feature"}],"type":"FeatureCollection"},"id":16118,"timeRating":"I","latitude":39.4678,"longitude":-31.1496,"version":"28fc5bb7453e37610ecba9ba867868c35a64c9ec07f1aed7f0f103f29ad66859"}
