Group of 5. Canyon time 1:20. We set up a shuttle. First rappel off bridge about 40 feet. Final rappel 75 feet into a gigantic pool, ledge about 30 feet from the bottom may be a jumping point but we did not try it. Water is dark brown from tannins. All jumps and slides must be tested by rappel first.\n<\/p><p><br \/>\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Background\">Background<\/h2><\/div>\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nParsed by mw‐api‐ext.codfw.main‐6779cc57fc‐fk6kf\nCached time: 20240914191855\nCache expiry: 2592000\nReduced expiry: false\nComplications: [show‐toc]\nCPU time usage: 0.005 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.006 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 21\/1000000\nPost‐expand include size: 0\/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 0\/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 2\/100\nExpensive parser function count: 0\/500\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0\/20\nUnstrip post‐expand size: 0\/5000000 bytes\nNumber of Wikibase entities loaded: 0\/400\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%    0.000      1 -total\n-->\n<\/div>","name":"Fazenda","shuttleSeconds":null,"id":16118,"waterRating":"B","technicalRating":3,"rappelCountMax":3,"rappelLongestMeters":22,"latitude":39.4678,"months":[],"url":"https:\/\/ropewiki.com\/Fazenda","quality":3.2,"riskRating":null,"geojson":{"features":[{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[[-31.1496,39.4678,0]]},"properties":{"name":"Start"}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"name":"End"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[[-31.141623,39.469901,0]]}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"LineString","coordinates":[[-31.149628,39.467873,0],[-31.149322,39.468068,0],[-31.149091,39.468213,0],[-31.148932,39.468291,0],[-31.148799,39.468355,0],[-31.14864,39.468418,0],[-31.1485,39.468466,0],[-31.148372,39.468503,0],[-31.148253,39.468516,0],[-31.148126,39.468526,0],[-31.147891,39.468522,0],[-31.147746,39.468487,0],[-31.147678,39.468453,0],[-31.147563,39.468418,0],[-31.147372,39.468403,0],[-31.147229,39.46841,0],[-31.147113,39.468432,0],[-31.147,39.468508,0],[-31.146824,39.468597,0],[-31.146659,39.468589,0],[-31.146532,39.468584,0],[-31.146383,39.468584,0],[-31.146236,39.468609,0],[-31.146131,39.468643,0],[-31.145937,39.468708,0],[-31.145616,39.468802,0],[-31.145407,39.468849,0],[-31.145178,39.468911,0],[-31.145039,39.468944,0],[-31.144893,39.468939,0],[-31.144747,39.468925,0],[-31.144543,39.468951,0],[-31.144361,39.46899,0],[-31.144241,39.469039,0],[-31.144051,39.469101,0],[-31.143968,39.469166,0],[-31.143957,39.469279,0],[-31.143978,39.469374,0],[-31.143983,39.469458,0],[-31.143915,39.469561,0],[-31.143741,39.469615,0],[-31.143567,39.469633,0],[-31.143371,39.46963,0],[-31.143269,39.469595,0],[-31.143181,39.469576,0],[-31.143042,39.469589,0],[-31.142969,39.469588,0],[-31.142804,39.469555,0],[-31.142674,39.469529,0],[-31.142536,39.469518,0],[-31.142409,39.469519,0],[-31.142267,39.469529,0],[-31.142103,39.469604,0],[-31.141978,39.469679,0],[-31.141796,39.469751,0],[-31.141623,39.469901,0]]},"properties":{"name":"Descent"}}],"type":"FeatureCollection"},"rappelCountMin":3,"timeRating":"I","version":"a5a497db1d8116047c63b7a4ddf290d37d25d0f9101a5f00edd2fa5cc9cf960b","permit":"No"}
