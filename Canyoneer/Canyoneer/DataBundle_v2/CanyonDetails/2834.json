  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>Leavitt Falls is a short but serious swift water canyon that holds\nmany technical challenges for the experienced canyoneer. A nice picture\nof the waterfalls can be seen <a\nhref=\"http://www.world-of-waterfalls.com/california-leavitt-falls.html\">here</a>.\nSet in the High Sierra, Leavitt Falls’s challenge is matched by its\nspectacular beauty. During a descent of Leavitt Falls you will be\npummeled by intense waterfalls, challenged to avoid dangerous hydraulics\nand treated to some really magnificent High Sierra views. The technical\nsection of Leavitt Falls is relatively short but the challenges are\nreal. Solid leadership with a good understanding of swift water\ncanyoneering is a must. This is no place for beginners!</p>\n<p>All the water in Leavitt Falls flows naturally through the canyon. In\na normal year, all this water flows through Leavitt Falls in spectacular\nfashion for most of the summer. It is a an awe-inspiring site to look at\nthe canyon in this condition but it would be very dangerous to attempt a\ndescent under high flow. Depending on the snowpack, the flow through\nLeavitt Falls will subside somewhat during mid to late summer, opening a\nwindow for descents. In big snow years this window may never open.\nPushing the limits in Leavitt Falls is a very dangerous proposition and\ncannot be recommended in any way.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>From Sonora Pass on CA-108 in the High Sierra, travel east 5.9 miles\nand park at a pullout on the south side of the road that is located just\nbefore CA-108 starts to head steeply downhill and next to a “12%\ndownhill grade” sign. This is the upper trailhead. The pullout is big\nenough for 2-3 cars. There is also a short driveway adjacent to the\npullout but this driveway has deep sandy soil and can easily stick a car\nthat is not 4WD. From the short driveway head south following a lateral\nridge. As you reach the end of the ridge start to descend southwest off\nof the ridge and down towards Leavitt Creek. Make your way down to the\ncreek, find a passage through the brush and walk the creek downstream a\nshort way to the top of the first falls in Leavitt Falls.</p>\n<h3 id=\"checkpoint\">Checkpoint</h3>\n<p>Before attempting a descent of Leavitt Falls it is important to check\nthe flow to make sure that it is not too high. This is best done from a\nviewing platform located 1/3 mile down from the Parking for the Approach\n(see map). You will find this platform at a turnout with a sign for the\n“Leavitt Falls Vista.” From the viewing platform most of the route is on\ndisplay before you. Note the second to last falls. The watercourse\nsplits at the top of this 80-foot tall falls, going around either side\nof a large spire. If water is flowing around both sides of the spire,\nthe flow is too high and a descent should not be attempted. If water is\nonly flowing around the right side of the spire (LUC) then the flow MAY\nbe low enough and it is worth hiking to the drop-in point of the canyon\n(first rappel) for a look.</p>\n<h3 id=\"shuttle\">Shuttle</h3>\n<p>You don't need to set up a shuttle, but if you have two vehicles,\npark one at the Vista point parking. If doing the Old Exit (not\nrecommended), you will need to leave a vehicle at the lower trailhead\nlocated 1.4 miles on CA-108 steeply downhill past switchbacks to a large\nparking area on the north side of the road that is across the street\nfrom the Leavitt Meadows Pack Station.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>Before committing to a descent of Leavitt Falls seriously consider\nthe flow you see going over the first falls. If you feel that you are up\nto it get ready for a wild ride!</p>\n<p><strong>Rap 1</strong>: 100 feet from a tree on the RIGHT (RDC) at\nthe head of the canyon. This is a double drop rap and is very\ninteresting. You may have noticed that the line of the rappel seems to\nintersect with the pounding beast of a waterfall to your left. The idea\nis to rap down to the first, hanging, pool which (hopefully) isn’t a\nswimmer while staying out of the main blast of water. Traverse carefully\nunder the first waterfall and climb up onto a ledge RDC. Be careful in\nhere as the current is strong and it will try to suck you and your\nhanging bag over the second falls below. Once on the ledge continue the\nrappel down relatively easily to the pool below. Be sure to set the rope\nlength or be prepared for a floating disconnect in current. When\ndeploying the rappel line, take caution to not have the rappel line get\ntangled in any debris. As of September 4, 2016, a log is jammed in the\nsecond tier of the water fall and the rope can easily become tangled in\nit.</p>\n<p>Swim to the rocks on the other side of the pool and await the rest of\nyour team.</p>\n<p>The rope pull from the first rappel can be very tricky due to debris\nlodged at the top of the lower waterfall in the rappel sequence. This\ndebris can tend to stick the rope after it has been pulled down off the\nanchor and is floating in the current. If at all possible, it is best to\nkeep the rope out of the lower waterfall during the pull. If it gets in\nthis waterfall, pull the rope quickly down so that it does not double\nover on itself and stick. The canyon in this section is not escapable\nand getting stuck would not be fun.</p>\n<p>It should be noted that the entire first waterfall sequence could be\nbypassed by rapping off a large tree a short ways downcanyon on the\nRIGHT (RDC). But, what fun would that be as you would miss a spectacular\ndrop and the first significant challenge in Leavitt Falls.</p>\n<p>Continue downstream through a magical hallway and down a few minor\ndownclimbs.</p>\n<p><strong>Rap 2</strong>: 30 feet from 2 bolts on the LEFT (LDC). This\nrappel drops straight though another raging waterfall in a narrow slot.\nIt can be done as a sort of self-belayed, rope assisted downclimb by the\nfirst canyoneer down. Be careful of a potential hydraulic at the base of\nthe falls. With one down a zip line can be set-up using the rocks at the\nfar end of the pool as a bottom anchor. It is best to leave a short\nrappel line as well so that canyoneers can get out on top of the boulder\nat the brink of the falls before zipping down.</p>\n<p>From this pool a difficult escape from the canyon may be possible by\nclimbing up a weakness on the RIGHT (LDC).</p>\n<p>Make your way though the rocks at the back of the pool and downclimb\non the RIGHT (RDC) to the next pool. Cross over to rocks on the other\nside of the canyon. In 2007 there was also a downed tree spanning the\ncanyon here that seemed like it could be walked by the brave to make\nthis cross-over. Note, this area of the canyon has rock fall danger,\nspeedy passage is advised.</p>\n<p>Continue down canyon to a nice 8 foot slide. Swim a pool and exit on\nthe RIGHT (LDC). You are now right next to the spire you eyed from the\nobservation deck. The next anchor is on the top of the spire.</p>\n<p><strong>Rap 3</strong>: 80 feet from 2 bolts in the MIDDLE of the\ncanyon on the top of a spire. Climb up the spire from the RIGHT (RDC).\nThis rappel is also tricky. Although it avoids the teeth of the braided\nfalls beside you at the top, the fall line heads into them towards the\nbottom. The first person down should work their way down canyon on the\nvertical wall as they head down the rappel. This will set up a pendulum\nbut will avoid entering the powerful falls high. Eventually you will\nloose your footing on the slippery rock and swing back into the falls.\nThere is a dangerous, deep, hanging pothole hidden in the falls about\n2/3 of the way down. Getting in it is very scary as the current will try\nto keep you and there is no bottom. All the pendulum business may help\nyou avoid this pothole. If you are lucky you will swing back into the\nfalls below the pothole and rap to the pool below. Consolation prize,\nthe pool at the bottom is only waist deep, easily managed and you will\nbe in quite the spectacular alcove between large and powerful falls.\nSet-up a guided rappel off of meat in the back of the alcove for the\nremainder of your team.</p>\n<p>Looking around, the inquisitive canyoneer may ask, “how do I get out\nof here?” The canyon narrows down into the top of the fiercest falls yet\nand canyon walls tower above. At the back of the alcove where your meat\nprobably was you will notice a ledge about 10 feet up. The next anchor\nand your escape are on this ledge. Getting there requires climbing a\ntough V4 boulder problem to top out on the ledge. Fortunately there is a\nhorn on the lip of the ledge that can be slung making it also go at A1!\nBe creative and top out on the ledge.</p>\n<p><strong>Rap 4</strong>: 115 feet from 2 bolts on the LEFT (LDC). This\nis a spectacular single drop beside a monster falls. There are little\nsections of freehang mixed in to the mostly vertical descent. Where you\nland in the pool below is only about waist deep. Marvel at the last\nfalls, gather yourself and start headed down stream sticking mostly to\nthe right bank of the creek. Usually staying on the bank provides faster\npassage than the watercourse itself though you will be forced back into\nthe water a few times. After a while the gradient flattens and the creek\nbed starts to get a bit brushier. Soon you come to the smallest dam in\nthe world. Get your gear off here next to the dam. You will be leaving\nthe water behind.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>Keep headed downhill until the walls of the canyon open up, at this\npoint you can leave the water and take one of two exit options.</p>\n<p>You can choose to do the old exit (1.2 miles downhill) or the new\nexit (</p>\n<h3 id=\"new_exit_0.25mi_uphill\">New Exit [0.25mi uphill]</h3>\n<p>Go up canyon right, following a path behind a rock outcrop that will\ntake you to the spine of the crest, from there follow game trails up the\nhill back to the vista point.</p>\n<h3 id=\"old_exit_1.2mi_downhill\">Old Exit [1.2mi downhill]</h3>\n<p>Keep headed downhill drifting farther and farther right (LDC) of the\ncreek. You may have to cross a small diversion stream. You will see a\nfence line in the woods marking a parcel of private property. STAY CLEAR\nOF THIS PROPERY. The landowner is friendly but please respect his\nproperty line. Skirt this property by heading right (LDC). You may pick\nup an old dirt road. Eventually the fence makes a 90-degree turn at the\nforest edge and a route into the spectacular Leavitt Meadows unfolds.\nHead east into the meadow until you reach a well-worn stock trail. Turn\nnorth (left) on this trail and follow it as it crosses back over Leavitt\nCreek and continues all the way out to your car at the Leavitt Pack\nStation.</p>\n<h3 id=\"alternate_exit_0.5mi_downhill\">Alternate Exit [0.5mi\ndownhill]</h3>\n<p>After the walls open up and the canyon disappears, exit the canyon\nright instead of left. Angle up to the left and you may find a nice game\ntrail that takes you to the bottom switchback of highway 108. This\nshould keep you above any private property and put you on the road just\nup the hill from your car. Just in case, it is probably wise to aim for\na GPS point: 38.322392,-119.556162 (see map)</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Beta was originally posted on sierracanyons.org (now defunct), <a\nhref=\"Media:LeavittFalls.pdf\" title=\"wikilink\">Open PDF</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/124082473\">Video featuring the first\ndescent</a></li>\n<li><a\nhref=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/55452339@N00/sets/72157600948473666/\">Pictures\nfrom 2007</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n<p>First descent by the SierraCanyons.org team, somtime between 2006 and\n2008.</p>\n",
