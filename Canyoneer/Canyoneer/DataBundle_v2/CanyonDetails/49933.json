Three great waterfall rappels.  The rappels are all true class C.  Walking around these falls would include serious bushwhacking, so come prepared to rappel them and in NC fashion, have the knowledge to ghost them.  This is not the place to learn canyoneering techniques, you should know how to rappel and how to build anchors before you do this canyon.\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Really simple approach.  Park in the parking area off FS140, then walk uphill.  When you see a split in the road from FS140, go right and continue uphill.  Further up there will be another split, take the left.  Drop in to the left when you feel like you are at your closest to the creek.  I would recommend throwing on your harness at the road.  For the spot I dropped down, it was easier for me to just do a quick rappel off a tree than it was to downclimb through the brush.  You definitely do not need to rappel, and there is probably a better spot to drop in if you explored more, but why not?\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Follow the creek until you get to the three waterfalls. \n<\/p><p>R1: 30 ft - Chestnut Falls - Off Tree RDC\n<style data-mw-deduplicate=\"TemplateStyles:r1062633282\">@media all and (max-width:720px){.mw-parser-output .content .thumb>div:not(.thumbinner){display:flex;justify-content:center;flex-wrap:wrap;align-content:flex-start;flex-direction:column}}body.skin-vector .mw-parser-output div.thumb>div:not(.thumbinner){font-size:94%;text-align:center;overflow:hidden;min-width:100px}body.skin-minerva .mw-parser-output div.thumb>div:not(.thumbinner){margin:0 auto;max-width:100%!important}<\/style> \n<\/p>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\">\n<div style=\"display:table;\">\n<span class=\"mw-default-size\" typeof=\"mw:Error mw:File\/Frameless\">\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>R2: 80 ft - Off Log Over Waterway\n<link rel=\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\" href=\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1062633282\"> \n<\/p>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\">\n<div style=\"display:table;\">\n<span class=\"mw-default-size\" typeof=\"mw:Error mw:File\/Frameless\">\n<\/div>\n<\/div>  <link rel=\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\" href=\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1062633282\"> \n<div class=\"thumb tright\">\n<div style=\"display:table;\">\n<span class=\"mw-default-size\" typeof=\"mw:Error mw:File\/Frameless\">\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>DC1: 10 ft - Down climb RDC through the falls.
