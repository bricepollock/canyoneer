Permits have a group-size limit that varies depending on the canyon or route.  A separate permit is required for each canyoneering route.  Currently, there is no quota limit nor permit cost, though that is likely to change at some point in the future.  Permits can be obtained onsite through a self-serve kiosk located just outside of the visitor center or by sending and email to care_permits@nps.gov using the following format:\n<\/p><p><b>Subject: <\/b> Name of canyoneering route and date you will be canyoneering. \n<\/p><p><b>Email Body: <\/b>\nDate of visit (single day only): \nCanyoneering route (single route only): \nNumber of people: \nVehicle location: \nNumber of motorized vehicles: \nVehicle description(s): \n<\/p><p>If you plan to camp overnight as part of a canyoneering trip, you are required to obtain a free backcountry permit, available at the visitor center. \n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading3\"><h3 id=\"Additional_Access_Information:\">Additional Access Information:<\/h3><\/div>\n<ul><li>CRNP canyoneering permit information webpage: <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external free\" href=\"https:\/\/www.nps.gov\/care\/planyourvisit\/canyoneering.htm\">https:\/\/www.nps.gov\/care\/planyourvisit\/canyoneering.htm<\/a><\/li>\n<li>Other: <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external free\" href=\"http:\/\/www.americancanyoneers.org\/access-capitol-reef\/\">http:\/\/www.americancanyoneers.org\/access-capitol-reef\/<\/a><\/li><\/ul>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading3\"><h3 id=\"Group-Size_Limit:\">Group-Size Limit:<\/h3><\/div>\n<p>Canyoneering groups are limited to a maximum of 12 people for this Canyon.\n<\/p><p>Groups larger than 8 or 12 sharing the same affiliation (school, church, club, scout group, family, friends, etc., or combination thereof) may divide into groups smaller than 8 or 12, provided they do not occupy the same canyon, drainage, general area or the same route on the same day.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading3\"><h3 id=\"Park_Entrance_Fee:\">Park Entrance Fee:<\/h3><\/div>\n<p>The Scenic drive is the only area of Capitol Reef where an entry fee or park pass is required.
