Covell is a great option when other nearby canyons are running high.  With an easy approach and exit, the canyon features some big waterfalls and is fairly open with a short narrows that adds to the appeal.  Flows reduce dramatically in the summer months, but the creek's low elevation and easy access make it a great option in the fall, winter, and spring.\n<\/p><p>Covell offers two main options... and an experienced team could run both of them in a single day.\n<\/p>\n<ul><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http:\/\/ropewiki.com\/Covell_Creek_(West_Fork)\">West Fork Covell Creek<\/a><\/li>\n<li>Main Fork of Covell Creek -- this page describes a descent of the main fork.<\/li><\/ul>\n<p>Note that both forks converge below Angel Falls at about 2000ft elevation where a trail crosses.

Park at the location indicated and follow the trail to Angel Falls. Several other side trails fork off of the main trail so be aware of this on the approach. Just before reaching Angel Falls, the trail crosses the main fork of Covell Creek which is the checkpoint for the flow.  Cross the main fork, then the west fork, then continue on up the Burley Mountain trail.  After several switchbacks, the trail starts to return to the creek.  At about:  46.42314, -121.85395 at ~2500ft elevation there's an easy place to drop West Fork.\n<\/p><p>Cross the West Fork and climb out the far side.  The forest is open and the going is so easy it can barely be called bushwhacking.  Head up the ridge a couple hundred feet until terrain abruptly flattens out around 2600' elevation.  Continue southeast for about five minutes and descend easy slopes to drop into the western fork of the Main Branch somewhere between 2500-2600' elevation.  Suit up and head downstream.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>DCL = Down Canyon Left, DCR = Down Canyon Right\n<\/p><p><b>Main Fork:<\/b>\n<\/p><p>The lack of major vegetation along the sides of the watercourse indicates this creek can rip from time to time.  \n<\/p>\n<ul><li>R1: 50ft from tree DCL.

This is <i>Covell Creek Falls<\/i> and is a great spot for photos. Signs around the watercourse request hikers to remain on the trail to avoid trampling the fragile plant life below the falls. Try to remain in the creek bed to access photo spots, and\/or if continuing downstream.<\/li><\/ul>\n<p>Two established trails connect and travel under the falls. Exit canyon right to return to your cars on trail. At the immediate junction, head downhill, then bushwhack a short bit to the road. Hike up the road a short ways to your cars. Alternatively, a longer, more scenic exit takes the right fork at that junction, and wraps around a nice cliff band. This will take you directly to your cars. \n<\/p><p>Below Covell Creek Falls is a high tourist area as there's a trail just above the creek DCR.
