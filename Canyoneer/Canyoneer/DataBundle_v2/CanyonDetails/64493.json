  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>Covell Creek provides ample fun for the canyoneer looking for\ncanyoning opportunities in the Randle area. Covell is a great option\nwhen other nearby canyons are running high. With an easy approach and\nexit, the canyon features some big waterfalls and is fairly open with a\nshort narrows that adds to the appeal. Flows reduce dramatically in the\nsummer months, but the creek's low elevation and easy access make it a\ngreat option in the fall, winter, and spring.</p>\n<p>Covell offers two main options... and an experienced team could run\nboth of them in a single day.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://ropewiki.com/Covell_Creek_(West_Fork)\">West Fork\nCovell Creek</a></li>\n<li>Main Fork of Covell Creek -- this page describes a descent of the\nmain fork.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Note that both forks converge below Angel Falls at about 2000ft\nelevation where a trail crosses. We'll call this spot \"the confluence.\"\nIt's a good place to check the flow on both creeks.</p>\n<p>Be aware: this area is quite popular with hikers. Use caution when\ndeploying your rope on some rappels.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Watershed: 1.16mi^2. Highest point in the watershed is about\n5200ft.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>Covell Creek is located just south of the Cispus Environmental\nLearning Center. Park at the location indicated and follow the trail to\nAngel Falls. Several other side trails fork off of the main trail so be\naware of this on the approach. Just before reaching Angel Falls, the\ntrail crosses the main fork of Covell Creek which is the checkpoint for\nthe flow. Cross the main fork, then the west fork, then continue on up\nthe Burley Mountain trail. After several switchbacks, the trail starts\nto return to the creek. At about: 46.42314, -121.85395 at ~2500ft\nelevation there's an easy place to drop West Fork.</p>\n<p>Cross the West Fork and climb out the far side. The forest is open\nand the going is so easy it can barely be called bushwhacking. Head up\nthe ridge a couple hundred feet until terrain abruptly flattens out\naround 2600' elevation. Continue southeast for about five minutes and\ndescend easy slopes to drop into the western fork of the Main Branch\nsomewhere between 2500-2600' elevation. Suit up and head downstream.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>DCL = Down Canyon Left, DCR = Down Canyon Right</p>\n<p><strong>Main Fork:</strong></p>\n<p>The lack of major vegetation along the sides of the watercourse\nindicates this creek can rip from time to time.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>R1: 50ft from tree DCL. This is a short drop (and least interesting\non the creek); most of the rope is needed for the horizontal distance.\nAt the bottom the central main branch enters and the amount of water\nincreases.</li>\n<li>R2: 30ft.</li>\n<li>R3: 65ft.</li>\n<li>R4: 120ft from tree DCL. There is an awkward move needed to reach\nthe anchor. In high flow, it may be better to rappel out of the water\nfrom a tree DCR.</li>\n<li>Bypass a short falls choked with fallen logs DCR.</li>\n<li>R5: <em>Bridal Veil Falls.</em> Not a big drop but very photogenic.\nFalls is 30ft high, but 80ft of rope is needed from a fallen tree across\nthe creek some distance back from the top.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Below R5, walk downstream to the confluence. The flow doubles (or\nmore) as the west fork of Covell Creek enters DCL. (Below this point the\nbeta is the same as the West Fork.)</p>\n<p><strong>Below the Confluence: (BC)</strong></p>\n<p>Continue downstream with 1-2 downclimbs until you reach BC-R1. If\nflow is too high, climb back up to the main trail and exit.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>BC-R1: 75' from fallen log DCR into a nice narrows.</li>\n<li>BC-R2: 75' from a tree DCL. This is <em>Covell Creek Falls</em> and\nis a great spot for photos. Signs around the watercourse request hikers\nto remain on the trail to avoid trampling the fragile plant life below\nthe falls. Try to remain in the creek bed to access photo spots, and/or\nif continuing downstream.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Two established trails connect and travel under the falls. Exit\ncanyon right to return to your cars on trail. At the immediate junction,\nhead downhill, then bushwhack a short bit to the road. Hike up the road\na short ways to your cars. Alternatively, a longer, more scenic exit\ntakes the right fork at that junction, and wraps around a nice cliff\nband. This will take you directly to your cars.</p>\n<p>Below Covell Creek Falls is a high tourist area as there's a trail\njust above the creek DCR. Leaving fixed anchors is not recommended.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>BC-R3: 20ft just below Covell Creek Falls. Anchor off a fallen log\nspanning the creek.</li>\n<li>BC-R4: 20ft drop a short distance downstream. Anchor off a fallen\nlog spanning the creek.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There are a few more short drops further downstream, but they may not\nbe worth your time. It's an easy exit up DCR to the trail.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>Exit immediately up DCR to the well-maintained trail just above the\ncreek. Head downstream following the trail until it crosses the creek at\nthe bottom of the hill. Instead of crossing the creek, cut right through\nthe brush and follow pink flagging tape to get back to the road. Walk\nback to the parking area.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<p>None.</p>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n<p>First descent of the main fork Covell was in May 2021 by Kevin Clark,\nLisa Ripps, Wim Aarts, and Ashley Driscoll.</p>\n",
