Yes, some people will say this is a low quality canyon, we really enjoyed it, and it is worthy of a trip through.\n<\/p><p>We did 5 abseils with the longest abseil being around 23mtrs beside a waterfall, it has a couple of great ledges to kick off from and free-fall, plus when you are hanging over the edge at the top, the view down into the amphitheatre is stunning.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Head downstream after the canyon opens out, you may notice a track on the left, this first track can lead you onto a high ledge and is not ideally the way to exit, though, if you do end up on this ledge, there are a few places you can abseil down to the correct level.\n<\/p><p>So, heading left around away from the canyon until you enter the bottom of Birrabang Brook, a short ways upstream, again tending left, you will find an easy ramp that leads you back up on top and not far from the walking track you came in on.\n<\/p><p>As exits go, this is pretty easy.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Red_tape\">Red tape<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Beta_sites\">Beta sites<\/h2><\/div>\n<ul><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https:\/\/ozultimate.com\/canyoning\/track_notes\/better_offer.htm\">OzUltimate.com<\/a>&#160;: Better Offer Canyon track notes<\/li><\/ul>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media<\/h2><\/div>\n<ul><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https:\/\/sleepwhenwearedead.net\/2016\/10\/29\/magnifying-glass-canyon-aka-better-offer\/\">Sleep When We're Dead<\/a>&#160;: MAGNIFYING GLASS CANYON.
