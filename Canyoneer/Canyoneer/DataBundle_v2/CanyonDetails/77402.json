It is easy to get to with a well defined walking track, until the last 100 or so meters to the start of the canyon and first abseil.\n<\/p><p>Originally known as Magnifying Glass Canyon.\n<\/p><p><i><b>Quality<\/b><\/i>\n<\/p>\n<ul><li>The canyon is rated 3 out of 10 on the Brennan Quality Scale.<\/li>\n<li>David Noble rates the canyon 2 out of 5 for quality and Medium for difficulty.<\/li><\/ul>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Follow the climbers track off the Bells Line until it is time to head right down into the top section of the canyon and the first abseil.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>It is of lower \"canyon\" quality, if you rank a canyon solely on \"canyony\" bits, it may rank lower than a lot of others, but it does have some great abseils, some nice canyon sections, and stunning views on the walk out, well, when not fogged in and you can actually see the views. Yes, some people will say this is a low quality canyon, we really enjoyed it, and it is worthy of a trip through.\n<\/p><p>We did 5 abseils with the longest abseil being around 23mtrs beside a waterfall, it has a couple of great ledges to kick off from and free-fall, plus when you are hanging over the edge at the top, the view down into the amphitheatre is stunning.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Head downstream after the canyon opens out, you may notice a track on the left, this first track can lead you onto a high ledge and is not ideally the way to exit, though, if you do end up on this ledge, there are a few places you can abseil down to the correct level.\n<\/p><p>So, heading left around away from the canyon until you enter the bottom of Birrabang Brook, a short ways upstream, again tending left, you will find an easy ramp that leads you back up on top and not far from the walking track you came in on.\n<\/p><p>As exits go, this is pretty easy.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Red_tape\">Red tape<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Beta_sites\">Beta sites<\/h2><\/div>\n<ul><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https:\/\/ozultimate.com\/canyoning\/track_notes\/better_offer.htm\">OzUltimate.com<\/a>&#160;: Better Offer Canyon track notes<\/li><\/ul>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media<\/h2><\/div>\n<ul><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https:\/\/sleepwhenwearedead.net\/2016\/10\/29\/magnifying-glass-canyon-aka-better-offer\/\">Sleep When We're Dead<\/a>&#160;: MAGNIFYING GLASS CANYON.
