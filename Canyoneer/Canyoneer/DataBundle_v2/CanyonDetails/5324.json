  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>A short route and nice alternate to get down into Big Tujunga. This\ncanyon could be descended to access any of the canyons on the North Side\nof Big Tujunga Creek such as Great Falls of the Fox, Fall Creek,\nToypurina etc. but is probably not really a route to do on it's own.</p>\n<p>At the bottom of this canyon you are pretty close to where the old\nFall Creek Fire Road used to cross Big Tujunga Creek (remnants of the\nbridge are still there).</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>The drainage starts off as a steep slope with some bushwhacking but\nsoon develops into more of a drainage. There are a few downclimbs and\nthe brush should clear out a bit. Then you arrive at the top of the\nfirst rappel.</p>\n<p><strong>Rappel 1: 50 Feet.</strong> Anchored from a bush RDC.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n<p>First known descent by: Dave Red, Steve Sieren and Alden Anderson.\nNamed after the \"Overlook\" label on the Forrest Service and USGS\nmaps.</p>\n",
