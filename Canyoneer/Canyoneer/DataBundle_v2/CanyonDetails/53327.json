  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>Via Ferrata Della Memoria is a great via ferrata inbetween the towns\nof Codissago and Enzo, and a good choice of something to do if Zemola is\nflowing too high. At first it might seemed like it is going to be dull\nand uninspiring but after the first ladder, the real heat starts to kick\nin. It has a nice mix of exposure and vertical terror interspersed with\ncomfy little ledges and great views of the river below and the dam.</p>\n<p>Be sure to bring a headlamp for each person because the start goes\nthrough old tunnels.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>Google Maps has the point marked as \"Ingresso FERRATA della Memoria -\nVajont\"; you can navigate to this point which is at a switchback in the\nroad. At this point there is a side road going off to the south; take\nthis for a few hundred yards to the parking area.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>After the end of the via ferrata, you will reach a junction on the\ntrail that will have a sign for the dam going to the right. This is not\nthe way back to the car -- go left, climbing up the hillside for 10 mins\nor so. Then you will find another junction with signs pointing back down\nto the town of Codissago. Follow these down the hillside back to your\ncar.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<p><a\nhref=\"https://www.vieferrate.it/pag-relazioni/trentino-alto-adige/117-tessa/396-vajont.html\">https://www.vieferrate.it/pag-relazioni/trentino-alto-adige/117-tessa/396-vajont.html</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n",
