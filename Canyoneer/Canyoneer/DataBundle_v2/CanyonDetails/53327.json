At first it might seemed like it is going to be dull and uninspiring but after the first ladder, the real heat starts to kick in. It has a nice mix of exposure and vertical terror interspersed with comfy little ledges and great views of the river below and the dam. \n<\/p><p>Be sure to bring a headlamp for each person because the start goes through old tunnels.\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Google Maps has the point marked as \"Ingresso FERRATA della Memoria - Vajont\"; you can navigate to this point which is at a switchback in the road. At this point there is a side road going off to the south; take this for a few hundred yards to the parking area.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>After the end of the via ferrata, you will reach a junction on the trail that will have a sign for the dam going to the right. This is not the way back to the car -- go left, climbing up the hillside for 10 mins or so. Then you will find another junction with signs pointing back down to the town of Codissago. Follow these down the hillside back to your car.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Red_tape\">Red tape<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Beta_sites\">Beta sites<\/h2><\/div>\n<p><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external free\" href=\"https:\/\/www.vieferrate.it\/pag-relazioni\/trentino-alto-adige\/117-tessa\/396-vajont.html\">https:\/\/www.vieferrate.it\/pag-relazioni\/trentino-alto-adige\/117-tessa\/396-vajont.html<\/a>\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Background\">Background<\/h2><\/div>\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nParsed by mw‐api‐ext.codfw.main‐6779cc57fc‐xk69j\nCached time: 20240914192020\nCache expiry: 2592000\nReduced expiry: false\nComplications: [show‐toc]\nCPU time usage: 0.005 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.006 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 21\/1000000\nPost‐expand include size: 0\/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 0\/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 2\/100\nExpensive parser function count: 0\/500\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0\/20\nUnstrip post‐expand size: 0\/5000000 bytes\nNumber of Wikibase entities loaded: 0\/400\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%    0.000      1 -total\n-->\n<\/div>","shuttleSeconds":null,"waterRating":null,"url":"https:\/\/ropewiki.com\/Via_Ferrata_Della_Memoria","latitude":46.2691,"geojson":null,"vehicle":null,"months":[],"riskRating":null,"rappelCountMin":null,"rappelLongestMeters":null,"name":"Via Ferrata Della Memoria","rappelCountMax":null,"quality":5,"id":53327,"timeRating":null,"version":"acb61d506529268024da84641fcc08367608e3b5ac90a4be00f309e9b8273802","technicalRating":null}
