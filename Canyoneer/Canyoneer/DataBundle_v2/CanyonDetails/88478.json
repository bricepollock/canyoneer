Waterfallsdb states it's on Kotsuck Creek, but maps call it Needle Creek.\n<\/p><p>It's a very visually appealing waterfall, but in practice one hard to enjoy canyoning. Enjoyable natural anchor placements are confounded by the width &amp; height of the falls.\n<\/p><p>After Sydney falls the creek briefly narrows, then continues downstream with much creek walking and the occasional moderately interesting feature.\n<\/p><p>There's a brief spurt of interesting features at the junction of Boundary Creek &amp; Needle Creek. An alternative suggestion to interested parties would be to leave the approach trail when crossing Boundary Creek, and drop down into the river there. There jumps to do, and gorgeous pools in hang around in, before creek walking downstream.
