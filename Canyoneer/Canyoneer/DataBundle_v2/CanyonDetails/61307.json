  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>Sholes Creek is a high flow, glacier fed canyon in the Baker\nSnoqualmie National Forest in northern Washington. It features a\nspectacular sequence coming down the two-tiered Sholes Creek Falls into\na large amphitheater. Because this creek is fed primarily from glacier\nand snow melt, the descent window is quite short at the end of\nsummer/early fall when temperatures begin to cool down.</p>\n<p>A 150’ rope is needed to rappel into the canyon.</p>\n<p>To check water level, walk the Bar Creek gravels from the bridge on\nthe east side of the creek to the confluence with Sholes Creek.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p><strong>Drive</strong>: From the Mt. Baker Highway (SR-542), turn\nright onto Forest Road 33. Be sure to stop at Nooksack Falls, a view of\nthese massive cascades is a 30 second walk from the parking area.\nContinue for just under 6 miles to the bridge crossing Bar Creek. There\nis plenty of parking by the bridge on either side.</p>\n<p><strong>Approach</strong>: From the bridge, cut into the brush on the\neast side of Bar Creek. There is an emerging use trail. Head up the\nhillside gaining 400 feet, being careful not to drop down into the\nvalley. You may even see signs of an old road that zig zags up the\nhillside here. After about 0.4 miles, scramble down the hillside about\n200' until it becomes noticeably steeper. You are aiming for 48.8534,\n-121.7717. Look for webbing around a white, double trunked tree.</p>\n<p><strong>R0:</strong> 150' from double white tree. There is a patch of\nthick Devil's Club at the bottom. Beware first person down.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>DCR = Down Canyon Right</p>\n<p>DCL = Down Canyon Left</p>\n<p><strong>LOWER SECTION</strong></p>\n<p>From the drop in point, it is easy to scramble up canyon into a very\npretty narrows and another short falls. This is definitely worth a look\nbefore heading down the canyon. Proceeding down canyon from the drop in\npoint, you immediately encounter a short drop. There is a downclimb DCR\nto a ledge 3 feet above the pool, or downclimb DCL up and over for a\ndirty downclimb.</p>\n<p>Downclimb/scramble down canyon about 100yds until you reach a 20’\ndrop into a logjam pool. This pool can be bypassed by downclimbing DCR.\nThis downclimb is a quite exposed. Consider rigging a handline or using\na partner assist.</p>\n<p>Carefully cross the creek to a series of ledges on CL. Avoid the pool\nhere which directly spills over the first tier of the big sequence.\nTraverse the ledges on CL to a rocky platform.</p>\n<p><strong>Sholes Creek Falls Sequence</strong></p>\n<p><strong>R1</strong>: 90’ DCL from a pair of unlinked bolts. Rappel\ndown a dryfall 45’ to a ledge. In high water stay on rope to exit the\npool DCL. Climb up and over the massive root ball of a fallen tree. The\nanchor for R2 is on the left side of the crack on the other side of the\nroot ball about 3 feet below the root ball. Hard to see at first, but\neasy once you set eyes on it.</p>\n<p><strong>R2</strong>: 120’ DCL from 2-bolt webbing anchor into a\nshallow pool. Set the rappel line over the rocky outcrop on the right in\nthe direction of the main falls. While this line may look intimidating,\nit is predominantly dry unless rappeler makes a concerted effort to lean\ninto the flow without slipping. It is possible to get under the flow for\nabout 30 feet, but gravity ultimately wins and pulls the rappeler to a\ndry line. Alternatively, rappel to the left of the rock outcropping for\na dry and dirty rappel, being careful not to scrape off the delicate\nmoss coating. Be wary of loose debris and rockfall on the dry side.</p>\n<p><strong>UPPER SECTION</strong></p>\n<p>By continuing the approach hike up to 3400' elevation and then\ndropping, you are rewarded with 2 more small rappels, some additional\ndownclimbing and creek walking to the standard drop in.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>Creek walk 500 feet and several short downclimbs to the confluence\nwith Bar Creek. Follow the gravel bars on either side of Bar Creek 600\nfeet to the bridge.</p>\n<p>For a work out, just below the amphitheater, cross the creek to a\nhandline DCR rigged up the hillside. Climb up a 200' gain to the end of\nthe rope. Free climb another 50' until you can finally start down to\nlose the elevation you have just gained. You will work up a sweat.\nFollow this trail across the hillside back to open forest from the\napproach. Descend back to the vehicles.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<p>Photo album from the first descent: <a\nhref=\"https://www.facebook.com/media/set?vanity=harukajames.lipscomb&amp;set=a.3044887732304376\">https://www.facebook.com/media/set?vanity=harukajames.lipscomb&amp;set=a.3044887732304376</a></p>\n<p><a\nhref=\"https://youtu.be/biXg2RzB_VY\">https://youtu.be/biXg2RzB_VY</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n<p>Sholes Creek Falls was first descended on 9/6/2020 by Kevin Steffa,\nTiffanie Lin, Haruka-James Clay Lipscomb, Erik Bernhoft, and Jake\nHuddleston.</p>\n",
