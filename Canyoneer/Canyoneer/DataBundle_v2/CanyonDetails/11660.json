  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>Bridal Veil Falls / Routeburn canyon is a great day out. It comprises\ntwo parts, an upper section and a lower section. The lower section is\ncommercially guided and starts at the bridge crossing the creek.</p>\n<p>Please be considerate of commercial trips that may in the canyon.\nConsider talking to <a href=\"https://www.canyonexplorers.nz\">Canyon\nExplorers in Queenstown</a> to check if they will have a group running\nthrough.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Park at the Routeburn Canyon track head (-44.71934, 168.27822)</li>\n<li>Walk along Routeburn Track until you reach the bridge (-44.71934,\n168.27822) crossing the creek that is fed by Bridal Veil Falls (which is\nmuch further upstream and you do not descend)</li>\n<li>The lower section starts at this bridge. You will see bolts near the\nbridge on both the river right and river left. Options!</li>\n<li>If you want to do the upper section there is a small faint track\nthat starts just 5m back from the bridge. There should be a blue arrow\nmarker.</li>\n<li>Follow the faint footpad up on the river left until you eventually\nreach approx -44.70868, 168.25785 (start-ish of the upper section where\nyou can don wetsuits)</li>\n<li>There should be the occasional bit of tape marking the route up but\ndon't be surprised if you loose the track... particularly as you reach\nthe start point</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<h3 id=\"upper_section\">Upper section</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>~10m, bolts, river right into pool (wade across)</li>\n<li>~20m, bolts, river left to ledge</li>\n<li>maybe a shoot slide but can down climb on river right</li>\n<li>~10m, bolts, river right to pool</li>\n<li>~32m, bolts on river right at edge of \"infinity pool\". Overhanging\nabseil down to low grade shoot/slide... can done with with 60m rope if\nyou are careful about how you come of the rope and hold on to pull side\nas you transition to slide</li>\n<li>~20m, bolts, river right down sloping slab</li>\n<li>~3m slide that you can easily accidentally just walk past into\nshallow pool</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id=\"lower_section\">Lower section</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>~8m, bolts, river right... pool looks worse than it is... can land\non rock ledge with some care</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>Proceed down canyon. Everything is small....</li>\n<li>There is more metal in this section than a smelter! Bolts\neverywhere.</li>\n<li>Anything that is remotely spicy can be bypassed. Lots of hand lines\nfor all the guided ducklings.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>After the last abseil walk down the creek a little bit and find a\npath on the bank of river left.</li>\n<li>Follow it until you hit Sugar Loaf Stream.</li>\n<li>Walk up Sugar Loaf Stream to get back to Routeburn track; or\ncontinue down the Routeburn River river bed, and with some accurate map\nreading climb out of the river bed to find the little southern loop of\nthe Routeburn track (there's also a spur path that overlooks the river,\nif you can find it).</li>\n<li>Enjoy the manicured Routeburn track back to car.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><img src=\"rwl_fr.png\" title=\"rwl_fr.png\" alt=\"rwl_fr.png\" /><a\nhref=\"http://descente-canyon.com/canyoning/canyon-description/22451\">Descente-Canyon.com</a>\n: Routeburn Canyon</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n",
