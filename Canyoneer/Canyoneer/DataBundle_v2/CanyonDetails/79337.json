Then cut off to the right, easy\nbushwacking, until you reach the creek.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>Make your way down the creek doing a lot of down-climbing or rappels\noff trees, or bushwhacking around to the left. This could perhaps be\nbypassed and made more interesting by doing a big 150-200ft-ish rap from\nthe cliffs down into the creek at about 47.7692, -120.8408.</p>\n<figure>\n<img src=\"Merrit_Falls_Routes.png\" title=\"Merrit_Falls_Routes.png\" />\n<figcaption>Merrit_Falls_Routes.png</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>The main section starts soon after:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>R1. 150ft rappel from a tree</li>\n<li>R2. 180ft rappel from two bolts underneath a ledge center\ncanyon</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Then a bit more creek walking to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Bonus rappel. 40ft from a tree</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As you head towards R1, there are several areas that could be turned\ninto rappels for the more enterprising canyoneer or may be of more\nintrigue during higher flow. Particularly, there is a two tier cascading\nfalls immediately at drop in point.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n<p>First descent by Eric Jorgenson, Amy Kolor and Maurice Kirejczyk on\n25 June 2023.</p>\n"
