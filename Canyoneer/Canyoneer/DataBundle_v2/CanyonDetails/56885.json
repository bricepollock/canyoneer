  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>Panther Creek is a short but very scenic canyon in Mount Rainier\nNational Park. It is a high-flow creek with a large drainage and may be\ndangerous to run early in the season; the creek can flow high even into\nlate summer. The canyon features some interesting geology and one of the\nbiggest logjams you're likely to find in a canyon route in Washington.\nIt is a very photogenic canyon that gets bonus points for an easy\napproach and exit. Make it a full day of canyons by combining Panther\nwith Middle Summit Creek, only 20 minutes away.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>Park on the north side of the bridge. On the north side of the\nbridge, head up into the fairly open forest. Simply parallel the creek,\nstaying just far enough away from the creek to avoid steep parts that\nappear and disappear. You may catch a few glimpses of the waterfalls in\nthe canyon as you approach. Continue until you reach a wide gully at\naround 46.7896, -121.5493. Traverse down into the gully easily to the\ncreek.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p><em>As with any canyon, be sure to check any pools for depth before\njumping. Some pools in this canyon can be surprisingly shallow.</em></p>\n<p><em>While not very deep, there are sections of this creek that are\ncommitting, particularly the last 2 rappels. There are several potential\nemergency exit points within the canyon but could be quite exposed and\nhave not been attempted.</em></p>\n<p>Just downstream from the drop-in you'll encounter an enormous logjam.\nNavigate your way over the logs very carefully, as they can be\ndeceivingly loose. DCL appears to be the easiest path. Just around the\ncorner from the logjam you'll reach the first series of pools.</p>\n<p>R1: 7' jump into a shallow pool, or downclimb DCR.</p>\n<p>R2: 20' from a tree cluster up high DCR. This is a two-tier pool\nsequence. You will need to downclimb slightly DCR, then directly up to\nreach this anchor.</p>\n<p>R3: 35' from a log DCL. Or downclimb DCR to a jump platform for a 15’\njump into a deep pool.</p>\n<p>R4: 7' jump, downclimb, or slide.</p>\n<p>(Note from a descender in Sept 2023. I did not keep track of the\ndrops in the canyon, but one of these last 2 pools has MANY shallow\nboulders. Downclimbing options are moderately advanced. Recommended to\nset an anchor. )</p>\n<p>R5: 40' from a tree DCR. May be jumped DCL into deep pool avoiding\ntwo massive old growth logs.</p>\n<p>R6: 55’ rappel from a log behind the falls. Or jump DCR. Can be\nrappelled down 10’ to a ledge for a 30’ jump into a wide pool. Aim down\nstream as pushing directly out across risks hitting the opposite wall.\nThe water falls through a beautiful little slot section here with into a\nvery deep pool. It is recommended to use human anchor technique for\nthose that do not want to jump. The last person then jumps, leaving no\nanchor behind. Natural anchor options are limited here. As of 2019 this\npool was at least 15ft deep. To jump, traverse the ledge about 25' DCR\nto a small dip in the ledge.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>In Sept 2020, we were able to anchor on a large log that had fallen\nacross the chasm. To reach the anchor: climb up onto the large shelf\nDCR. This is tricky requiring you to climb up next to the outlet of the\nbig pool. Getting up on the ledge may require partner assistance.\nApproach the anchor with caution; it's a dirty grovel... but you get to\nclean off in the pool at the bottom of the rappel.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>This drop should probably be bolted for safety.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<p>Follow the creek back to the bridge and hike up to the road where\nyour cars are waiting.</p>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<p>Although the creek is inside the national park boundary, using SR 123\ndoes not require a national parks pass or entry fee.</p>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n<p>Descended by Jake Huddleston and Kevin Steffa in October 2019.\nWebbing was found at the last drop indicating the canyon had been\npreviously descended by another group. No signs of fixed anchors\nanywhere else in canyon. Date of first descent unknown.</p>\n",
