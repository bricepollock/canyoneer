  "description": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>A unique canyon for Brisbane, high walls in a soft volcanic\nconglomerate with ferns littering the sides of the canyon. The main\nattraction of the canyon is the 28m pitch.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>Two extra 7m pitches can be added by entering the creek from the\nship-stern track.</p>\n<h2 id=\"descent\">Descent</h2>\n<p>All natural anchors in the canyon. Make sure your well versed in\nghosting techniques and natural anchor building! There are points\nwithout any easy anchor options.</p>\n<p>Caution should be exercised on the pull down here at the 28m pitch -\nfiddlesticks are not suitable due to a chockstone below the tree used as\nan anchor. Ropes have got stuck here because of this! Even on a standard\npulldown, one must be careful the rope doesnâ€™t catch on the log at the\nbase of the pitch (pictured left). Many crayfish harbor in pools below\nthis pitch so exercise caution.</p>\n<p>A few unpleasant rough slides exist in the canyon. It should be noted\nthat despite its small size, it is inescapable once you enter via the\nmain 28m pitch.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exit\">Exit</h2>\n<h2 id=\"red_tape\">Red tape</h2>\n<h2 id=\"beta_sites\">Beta sites</h2>\n<h2 id=\"trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</h2>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n",
