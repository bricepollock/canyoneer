This rappel could be skipped but is probably the easiest way to start the canyon.<\/li><\/ul>\n<ul><li><b>R1<\/b>: 100 feet - Anchored from a large bush and\/or small arch--both or which are set back quite a distance from the edge.  The webbing for this anchor needs to be extended to the edge for 1) a true 100 foot rappel, and 2) a clean pull.  If the webbing is not extended to the edge the rappel will be longer than 100 feet and will also put grooves into the rock so check your pull first.  A significant amount of webbing will be needed to rig this anchor.<\/li><\/ul>\n<ul><li><b>R2<\/b>: 40 feet - Anchored from a chockstone into a tight crack.<\/li><\/ul>\n<ul><li><b>R3<\/b>: 50 feet - Anchored from a solution pocket up high RDC.  This is a two-stage rappel and there can be a pool at the bottom.  The start for this can be awkward for many.  Be mindful of abrasion on the rope here.<\/li><\/ul>\n<ul><li><b>R4<\/b>: 60 feet - Anchored from a slung horn LDC or a deadman.<\/li><\/ul>\n<ul><li><b>R5<\/b>: 35 feet - Anchored from a deadman.  The drop has a bit of a \"V\" to it.  It doesn't look all that bad but it can and has stuck ropes.  Make sure the webbing extends over the edge here.<\/li><\/ul>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Return the same way you came.

Permits have a group-size limit that varies depending on the canyon or route.  A separate permit is required for each canyoneering route.  Currently, there is no quota limit nor permit cost, though that is likely to change at some point in the future.  Permits can be obtained onsite through a self-serve kiosk located just outside of the visitor center or by sending and email to care_permits@nps.gov using the following format:\n<\/p><p><b>Subject: <\/b> Name of canyoneering route and date you will be canyoneering. \n<\/p><p><b>Email Body: <\/b>\nDate of visit (single day only): \nCanyoneering route (single route only): \nNumber of people: \nVehicle location: \nNumber of motorized vehicles: \nVehicle description(s): \n<\/p><p>If you plan to camp overnight as part of a canyoneering trip, you are required to obtain a free backcountry permit, available at the visitor center. \n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading3\"><h3 id=\"Additional_Access_Information:\">Additional Access Information:<\/h3><\/div>\n<ul><li>CRNP canyoneering permit information webpage: <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external free\" href=\"https:\/\/www.nps.gov\/care\/planyourvisit\/canyoneering.htm\">https:\/\/www.nps.gov\/care\/planyourvisit\/canyoneering.htm<\/a><\/li>\n<li>Other: <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external free\" href=\"http:\/\/www.americancanyoneers.org\/access-capitol-reef\/\">http:\/\/www.americancanyoneers.org\/access-capitol-reef\/<\/a><\/li><\/ul>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading3\"><h3 id=\"Group-Size_Limit:\">Group-Size Limit:<\/h3><\/div>\n<p>Canyoneering groups are limited to a maximum of 12 people in Wives 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 &amp; 6 \nCanyoneering groups are limited to a maximum of 8 people in TOTGA\n<\/p><p>Groups larger than 8 or 12 sharing the same affiliation (school, church, club, scout group, family, friends, etc., or combination thereof) may divide into groups smaller than 8 or 12, provided they do not occupy the same canyon, drainage, general area or the same route on the same day.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading3\"><h3 id=\"Park_Entrance_Fee:\">Park Entrance Fee:<\/h3><\/div>\n<p>The Scenic drive is the only area of Capitol Reef where an entry fee or park pass is required.
