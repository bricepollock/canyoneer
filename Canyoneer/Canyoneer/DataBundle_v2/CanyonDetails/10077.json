west on route 66, then south on FR 231 (Woody Mountain Rd).  After 14 miles turn right onto FR 538 and follow it for 11.2 miles ignoring all branching roads that take you off 538 to turn left onto FR 6261.  Drive a short distance down this spur road to park at Hidden Cabin.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>From the car park at Hidden Cabin hike back along FR6261 toward FR 538, turning left (south) on FR 538 for a short distance to locate the first minor drainage on the west side of the road that drains toward Hidden Cabin Canyon.  Duck under the fence in the drainage and head all the way down this short, brushy tributary until it connects to the main drainage of the canyon, turning left (south) to continue.  A straight forward, forested hike will bring you the first rappel, about 20 feet from a tree at the top of the drop.  The second rappel lies shortly thereafter and is a two-tiered drop of 25 feet each from another tree anchored on canyon left.  More bushwacking and downclimbing brings you to a slightly trickier downclimb on canyon right or rappel off any of the many trees at the top of the drop.  Rappel 3 is about 70 feet (the drop is only about 40 feet, but the anchor is about 25 feet back from the edge of the drop) down a chute from a tree on canyon right.  Continue hiking down canyon until you reach the confluence with upper Loy Canyon.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>When you reach Loy canyon, continue hiking south up a short slope to locate Loy Canyon Trail.  Turn left here and follow this obvious, open trail up an exposed, manzanita covered slope to reach the saddle at the head of the canyon and a junction with Secret Mountain Trail.  Turn left heading north here toward Secret Mountain trailhead, which leads to the end of FR 538.  Follow FR 538 north back to FR 6261 turning right to reach the car park.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Red_tape\">Red tape<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Beta_sites\">Beta sites<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media<\/h2><\/div>\n<ul><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external free\" href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/pat.winstanley.7\/media_set?set=a.948432115215486.1073742004.100001461198708&amp;type=3\">https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/pat.winstanley.7\/media_set?set=a.948432115215486.1073742004.100001461198708&amp;type=3<\/a><\/li><\/ul>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Background\">Background<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Our trip through this canyon was not the first descent, as there were anchors present, but I suspect that this canyon has not seen many descents.  \"Hidden Cabin\" may act as a place holder name for the canyon should the first descentionists wish to claim discovery and add their own name.\n<\/p>\n\n\n<\/div>","waterRating":"A"}
