If looking for the technical, top-down route for the subway see <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external free\" href=\"https:\/\/ropewiki.com\/The_Subway\">https:\/\/ropewiki.com\/The_Subway<\/a>.\n<\/p><p>This route requires a permit and is an out-and-back route beginning from, and returning to, the Left Fork Trailhead in Zion NP.  This route is also known as the Left Fork of North Creek--bottom-up route.  When applying for permits on the park's website that is the name the permit will be under.  \n<\/p><p>This hike crosses the river several times and in high runoff conditions can be somewhat treacherous or exhausting.  It can be a long day and route finding can be difficult, especially in the dark. Many groups have missed the exit, become exhausted or trapped by high water, and have even had to be rescued after being stuck in quicksand.  Most groups will not have these issues if they come prepared--still, don't underestimate this hike.   \n<\/p><p>The bottom-up route accesses the Subway proper--the curved, tunnel-like section that gives the subway its name.  This section is very scenic but is also very short.  You will hike a long ways to see it.  The upper end of the subway proper is the base of a waterfall.  Above the waterfall is the technical section of the subway which is unreachable via this route.  Everything above the waterfall must be accessed via the top-down technical route which does require rappelling.  While there is cools stuff to see in the upper, technical section, there aren't anymore tunnel--or subway-like features above the falls.  If you goal is to see the famous Zion Subway, the bottom-up route will not be missing out on anything thing.\n<\/p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp\/toc\" \/>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Approach\">Approach<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Begin you hike from the Left Fork Trailhead.  There is a clear trail heading east from the parking lot\/ trailhead.  This will follow the plateau for a bit then it descends down a rocky switchback section to the river.  On return\/exit you will hike back up this trail--this then becomes the famous and dreaded up climb portion of the Subway Exit.  Once down to the river follow the trail up stream.  For a while there is a clear trail but eventually it will get less obvious and you will be hiking in-river.  The park ask that you stay in the watercourse rather than cutting trails on the banks.  \n<\/p><p>The Subway proper--the curved, tunnel-like section is at the very end of the hike and you will know it when you see it.  This is a very scenic, but short section.  Enjoy your time here.  Water levels will vary, but please not it can be slippery and there are a few potholes that you can step in so watch your step in the Subway.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Descent\">Descent<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Exit\">Exit<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Return the way you came by hiking down stream and reversing your course.  At the point where you are supposed to hike back up to the plateau there is a sign (unless it gets washed out by floods) that can be easily missed--especially if hiking in the dark.  Have headlamps with you, a good GPS\/mapping system, and the tracks downloaded.  Many groups have missed this turn both in the dark and in the daylight.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Red_tape\">Red tape<\/h2><\/div>\n<p>A permit is required for this hike and it can be very difficult to obtain. A lottery is held more than a month in advance for popular dates, and popular dates include most weekends June through September. Descending Russell Gulch or Das Boot requires an additional permit apart from the Subway permit.\n<\/p><p>When applying for permits on the park's website the permit is listed as \"Left Fork North Creek (SUBWAY)\" and will give you the option to choose the your route\/itinerary as either the top-down technical route or bottom-up non technical route.  The itinerary you want for the bottom-up route is \"Subway Round Trip from Left Fork (bottom) Trailhead\".\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Beta_sites\">Beta sites<\/h2><\/div>\n<ul><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http:\/\/roadtripryan.com\/go\/t\/utah\/zion\/the-subway\">RoadTripRyan.com<\/a> &#160;: The Subway (From the Bottom)<\/li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http:\/\/canyoneeringusa.com\/utah\/zion\/off-trail\/the-subway-from-the-bottom\">CanyoneeringUSA.com<\/a> &#160;: Subway Bottom-Up<\/li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http:\/\/ropewiki.com\/User:Zion_Canyoneering_Book?id=Subway_from_the_Bottom\">Zion Canyoneering Book by Tom Jones<\/a> &#160;: Subway from the Bottom<\/li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http:\/\/americansouthwest.net\/slot_canyons\/zion_national_park\/north_creek.html\">AmericanSouthwest.net<\/a> &#160;: North Creek; Left Fork<\/li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http:\/\/climb-utah.com\/Zion\/subway.htm\">Climb-Utah.com<\/a> &#160;: Subway - Left Fork of North Creek<\/li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http:\/\/ropewiki.com\/User:Super_Amazing_Map?id=The_Subway_-_Zion_Area\">Super Amazing Map<\/a> &#160;: The Subway<\/li><\/ul>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media<\/h2><\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Background\">Background<\/h2><\/div>\n\n\n<\/div>","id":82949,"rappelCountMin":null,"version":"345c3ba6f1eec68e123b0f67eba87778d03e0a1eec943ee5952546e1f8038552","timeRating":"III","technicalRating":1,"waterRating":"C"}
